The United States Internal Revenue Service has offered a bounty of up to $625,000 to anyone who can break purportedly untraceable privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) as well as trace transactions on Bitcoin���s (BTC) Lightning Network.  The official proposal, published last week, says the IRS will accept submissions in the form of working prototypes until Sept. 16. If accepted, applicants will receive an initial payment of $500,000. This grant will allow applicants to develop their prototype into a working concept over the next eight months. Once the pilot test is completed and approved by the government, a further $125,000 grant will be awarded.   The announcement defines the initiative���s primary objectives as helping IRS Criminal Investigation, or CI, special agents to trace transactions ��� including identifying wallets, transaction dates and times ��� and amounts transferred. The agency hopes to use the tools to predict the future transactions of flagged addresses. The final products must also provide CI full control, with the ability to further develop or modify them so that the organization does not have to rely on any external vendors. Monero is one of the virtual currencies preferred among criminal organizations over more traceable crypto assets like Bitcoin. The IRS noted that XMR is being used for all future ransom demands and transactions by ransomware group Sodinokibi due to its ���privacy concerns.��� Related News: CipherTrace claims to track Monero transactions Demand for privacy coins among criminal syndicates has grown as authorities have increased their crypto forensics capabilities and employ the skills of private contractors such as Chainalysis. In recent years, Chainalysis has assisted law enforcement in tracking Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions to successfully fight child abuse, money laundering and terrorist financing. Last month, Chainalysis was integral in the takedown of three terrorist organizations. Privacy coins are a key strategy to help criminals obfuscate their transactions, with the IRS stating:   Blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace claims to have a new tool that can trace Monero transactions, although its capabilities are yet to be confirmed. The company announced that the tool, which took more than a year to develop, will be used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. CipherTrace chief financial analyst John Jeffries said the tool can track stolen Monero used for illegal transactions back to the source, such as in ransomware cases.	2
Major United States crypto exchange Coinbase will be giving its employees one week off each quarter in 2022 to recharge after ���long days and long weeks��� of intense work. In a Monday blog post, Coinbase chief people officer L. J. Brock said ���Nearly the entire company will shut down��� for four separate weeks this year as part of an experiment in allowing workers to recuperate after completing intense workloads. Brock said the exchange���s employees aren���t necessarily limited to 40-hour work weeks and may have to ���pivot at a moment���s notice,��� seemingly creating the potential for burnout. ���We realized in 2020 that many employees weren���t taking enough time off to recharge, either because they didn���t want to force their teammates to cover for them or because they didn���t want to fall behind on their work,��� said Brock. ���We knew this was unsustainable, so we scheduled a recharge week at the end of 2020 and two recharge weeks in 2021, when nearly the entire company would shut down. [...] Subsequent employee surveys made it clear: recharge weeks work.��� Coinbase added: The announcement comes as many U.S. workers are pushing back against unfavorable job conditions, often resulting in changing careers or quitting without a definitive plan ��� a trend many have started calling ���the Great Resignation.��� Cointelegraph reported in September that positions requiring expertise in crypto and blockchain increased in 2021, with many companies now offering crypto payments to capitalize on the space���s seemingly growing popularity and attract new workers. At the start of the pandemic, Coinbase changed its policy to allow employees to work remotely from their homes, with CEO Brian Armstrong saying the company would continue to offer the option once the ���restrictions of quarantine are over.��� In May, the crypto exchange announced that it planned to completely close its San Francisco headquarters sometime in 2022 as part of its commitment to ���being remote first.��� Coinbase is committed to being remote first. We announced we no longer have an HQ and as a next step, we���re closing our SF office (our former HQ) in 2022. Though not based in the United States, major crypto exchange Binance has taken a similar stance on having physical offices. The exchange has no formal headquarters, but its holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands, with previous connections to China, Japan, Malta and Seychelles. CEO Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, reportedly lives in Singapore, and many of Binance���s employees are spread across the globe.	1
A new theory regarding the true identity of anonymous Bitcoin (BTC) creator Satoshi Nakamoto has emerged from an extremely unlikely source. Enter the Escobar family and its story about Yasutaka Nakamoto. The story goes like this: Yasutaka Nakamoto was a high-ranking engineer for Pacific West Airlines who worked for Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, smuggling drugs into the United States from South America. Yasutaka disappeared completely from public view in 1992 after surviving an assassination attempt by his former employer. He then resurfaced years later to create and launch Bitcoin. He is also supposedly the brother of Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. At least that���s the story told to Cointelegraph by Olof Gustaffson, the CEO of Escobar Inc. ��� the multinational holding company associated with Escobar. Gustaffson is a 27-year-old Swedish entrepreneur who started his first business at age 13. By the time he was 21, he had become CEO of the Escobars��� multinational conglomerate based in Medell��n, Colombia. In a recent phone call with Cointelegraph, Gustaffson ��� the right-hand man to Escobar's brother Robert ��� relayed this fantastical version of events in an effort, he said, to silence some of the furor created by self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig S. Wright.  Olof Gustafsson, CEO of Escobar Inc. Source: @olof_gustafsson/Twitter According to Gustafsson, Yasutaka���s position as a head engineer for Pacific West Airlines made him the perfect insider for Escobar���s drug-smuggling operations. Where commercial pilot Barry Seal (played by Tom Cruise in the film American Made) had previously delivered drugs for Escobar, Yasutaka could continue carrying the torch, thanks largely to the unrestricted access afforded him in his role at the airline, said Gustafsson. Gustafsson went on to claim that Yasutaka���s experience with microprocessors and semiconductors supplied him with a base of technical knowledge that he would later apply to the world���s first cryptocurrency. According to Gustafsson, Yasutaka was a renegade ��� wild enough to work for Escobar but stubborn enough to never pledge his loyalty. Only one public mention of any Yasutaka Nakamoto can be found online. Gustafsson outlined a Los Angeles Times article from Oct 1., 1992, that tells the story of Hughes Aircraft Co. employee Yasutaka A. Nakamoto, who emerged unscathed after finding a pipe bomb in his car while parked at work. The article states: ���Hughes employee Yasutaka A. Nakamoto, 39, at first thought his car had been burglarized because the window had been broken, Sgt. Andy Gonis said. He then found the device under the seat.��� As per policy, the police refused to give out any further details about the bomb. They also refused to speculate as to why an aircraft engineer would find himself the target of a car bombing. This assassination attempt marked the end of a fruitful period of drug-running collaboration for Nakamoto and Escobar, said Gustafsson. It also marked the last time Yasutaka Nakamoto was ever heard from. Escobar Inc. has already dipped its toe into the cryptocurrency world. In 2018, Roberto Escobar launched ���Diet Bitcoin,��� a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that eventually relocated to Ethereum���s ERC-20 architecture in 2019. But the company also excels at provocative publicity. In 2016, Roberto Escobar started a GoFundMe campaign that sought to raise $50 million to accelerate the impeachment of Donald Trump. Roberto Escobar claimed to have information crucial to Robert Mueller���s investigation. The GoFundMe page was removed by the fundraising company due to a lack of clarity about how the funds were being allocated. It raised over $10 million in 10 hours before the campaign was shut down. The same year, Roberto Escobar threatened Netflix with a $1 billion lawsuit over what he claimed were inaccurate depictions of his persona in the hit series Narcos. Roberto Escobar also demanded the right to edit subsequent seasons of the show himself. In previous years, Roberto Escobar has claimed Satoshi approached him personally for help in building Bitcoin. Other times, Escobar has claimed that Satoshi was really a cipher for the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S government. In 2019, this reporter revealed Gustafsson and Roberto Escobar to be the former owners of the Bitcoin trademark, registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright made headlines in 2019 when he staked his own claim with the USPTO for Bitcoin's naming rights. After failing to respond to Wright���s claim in the allotted six-month time period, Gustafsson���s United Kingdom.-based company, Coin Legal Ltd., lost control of the Bitcoin trademark.  Now the pendulum appears to have swung back the other way. The latest filings on the USPTO website show Bitcoin���s naming rights to be back under the control of Coin Legal Ltd. The latest changes to the filing were made as recently as April 14, and a review process is underway at this very moment. Like every theory about Satoshi���s identity to emerge in recent years, the story of Yasutaka Nakamoto remains light on evidence and credibility. The only person who could contest or corroborate this Bitcoin creation story would be Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who Gustafsson claims is Yasutaka���s brother.  Dorian Nakamoto was the subject of a brief but intense period of speculation in 2014 after a Newsweek reporter published claims that he was the ���face behind Bitcoin.��� Before eventually denying any involvement with Bitcoin, Dorian Nakamoto initially told reporters he was ���no longer involved in that��� and that he couldn���t discuss it. Gustafsson pointed to this Whitepages entry for a Dorian S. Nakamoto, which aligns with Dorian���s age and area of residence. The same entry lists six relatives, one of them Yasutaka A. Nakamoto. According to Gustafsson, this is the Nakamoto everyone has been looking for. He said: ���We believe his middle name is Akiko, and that he later went by the name Akiko. A man by the name Akiko was registered at the address of Dorian in California.��� That���s possibly corroborated by a U.S. phonebook search that lists four of Dorian���s same relatives for one Akiko Nakamoto. The Whitepages listing for Yasutaka A. Nakamoto also shows he lived at the same address as Dorian. But such listings don���t amount to conclusive proof and could potentially be manipulated by unrelated third parties. Gustafsson contends that Dorian knew all about Yasutaka���s involvement with Bitcoin and that Dorian himself had traveled to Colombia to conduct business with Roberto Escobar in 2014, in the wake of Yasutaka���s disappearance after the car-bomb-at-work incident. This version of Satoshi, if true, can now only take posthumous credit for his invention. Gustafsson claims creating Bitcoin was one of Yasutaka���s final acts before passing away in the early 2010s. Meanwhile, after years of harassment following the discredited Newsweek article, Dorian Nakamoto has urged Bitcoiners and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to leave him alone. Although standard journalistic practice would dictate reaching out to Dorian Nakamoto in this instance, Cointelegraph instead aims to respect Dorian���s wishes and has not contacted him. When asked why he had come forth with this information now, Gustafsson said, ���Roberto believes it is important to set the record straight.���	1
It seems that Blockchain technology is becoming ubiquitous among financial and technology spaces these days. With a huge adoption curve, the new technology space is quickly finding use cases in a number of industries. The latest addition to the Blockchain revolution is insurance, as a group of fourteen European insurance providers have partnered together with Deloitte and other firms to provide a simple system for insurers to comply with the Hamon Law, with requires insurers to provide simple transfers for clients who wish to change companies during the first year. The system will allow for highly secure information storage for customer data. The newest regulations from the EU, called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will take effect in 2018, and could impose massive fines on companies that aren���t particularly protective of consumer data. The Blockchain technology platform will do what other technologies cannot in data protection. The platform specifically relies on the Proof of Process technology in order to secure user data through a shared data repository. The system will limit data release to the absolute minimum for processing transactions. With increasing need for security, Blockchain is bringing substantial change for the insurance sector. Adam Perlow Founder and CEO of Zen Protocol, said: ���If the insurer sets some money in a smart contract, and the contract pays out based on the occurrence of an event as determined by an objective actuary/oracle, then there is no need for novel incentive schemes, the insurer simply cannot avoid the payout. In the long run, as one insurance company uses smart contracts to gain the public trust, others will be forced to follow suit.���	2
One of the most hotly debated topics around cryptocurrencies is what people can actually purchase with Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren. With Bitcoin���s 10th birthday just around the corner, it's worth taking a look at some of the most outrageous and expensive things people have been able to purchase with BTC. We have certainly come a long way since the infamous Bitcoin pizza incident, where Laszlo Hanyecz ordered two pizzas from Papa John���s for 10,000 BTC back in 2010. It goes to show how much progress has been made in eight years ��� especially when you take a look at how much you���d pay for those same two pizzas with Bitcoin today. Given the gradual rise in value of Bitcoin over the years, early adopters who got their hands on substantial sums of the cryptocurrency found themselves with an incredible amount of wealth in the last two years. Some may have sold their Bitcoin, while others have adopted the ���hodl��� mantra. Nevertheless, as the popularity of cryptocurrencies has increased, people have been open to selling real-world assets ��� from cars to islands ��� for a slice of the proverbial crypto pie. Let's explore the wide variety of worldly possessions people can buy with their hoards of cryptocurrency. Any crypto enthusiast is familiar with the phrase ���When Lambo,��� as the luxury vehicle has become somewhat of a cult icon for crypto-made billionaires, who have bought the sports cars with their crypto-wealth. While a Lamborghini may be the goal, people have been able to purchase a wide variety of vehicles, from affordable hatchbacks to luxury sports cars, with cryptocurrency for some time now. A luxury car dealership in Japan now accepts Bitcoin as a payment method through renowned cryptocurrency exchange BitFlyer. According to the company, customers can easily pay for their next prospective vehicle in a matter of minutes ��� which certainly beats conventional means of buying vehicles, like obtaining finance through a bank. While this dealership is driving forward a new payment model, it���s not the first time people have been able to buy cars with crypto. In December last year, a Manchester car owner listed a gold-colored Rolls Royce on Autotrader, which could only be purchased with Bitcoin. BlockShow Asia 2017 also provided the stage for BitCar to promote their platform, which allows people to buy and sell exotic cars like Lambos using cryptocurrency. The latest company to begin accepting payment in crypto is American dealership Post Oak Motor Cars. The Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Bugatti dealership now accepts Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash from clients. Owned by billionaire Tilman Fertitta, the company offers customers this facility around the world.  Astonishingly, some people are even willing to accept cryptocurrency for property, an asset class that has historically considered a good store of wealth and investment. In this particular section, there is big divide between what you can buy with cryptocurrency, from a modest home to an entire tropical island. Starting off with that piece of Caribbean paradise, a plot of on Union Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines went up for sale in Bitcoin late last year. The ��5.3 million, 13-acres plot was only up for sale in Bitcoin, with the owners asking for 570 BTC at the time. Investors looking for property in the Middle East had the chance to buy a number of apartments in Dubai. A couple of British entrepreneurs listed 50 luxury flats for sale in Bitcoin in February this year, and amazingly all of those properties were sold. Incredibly one of the investors has bought 10 of the properties with Bitcoin. We���ve also seen a number of mansions up for sale across the world, including a luxury mansion in Notting Hill in London, with the investment firm selling the property only taking payment in Bitcoin. Across the Atlantic Ocean, an early Bitcoin investor listed his Miami mansion for sale, making payment in Bitcoin an option for prospective buyers. It���s not all about million dollar mansions though, as a home in Grimsby on the North Coast of England was put on sale for 18 BTC in October 2017. For the lovers of the finer things in life, it is possible to buy expensive jewelry with cryptocurrency. Diamond retailer Samer Halimeh New York has been accepting crypto payments for jewelry since September 2017. The move is an interesting one, as it was sparked by an increase demand from customers looking to buy jewelry worth more than $1 million. Reeds is another American jewelry retailer that has begun accepting payment in Bitcoin. Their offerings go further than just conventional jewelry, as customers are able to buy gold ingots and loose diamonds with the cryptocurrency. This essentially allows cryptocurrency holders to diversify their investments, should they choose to take an easier way by obtaining traditional stores of value like gold and diamonds. Bitcoin has also been used by some to purchase a wide variety of tickets, from big events to good old plane tickets. Earlier this year, an American NFL fanatic was able to buy front row tickets for the Super Bowl through an online platform. The transaction cost $19,000, which was 2.2 BTC at the time, and the website that facilitated the purchase made a special effort to accept the cryptocurrency for the first time. Those that have been bitten by the travel bug and have a substantial amount of Bitcoin in their possession can also travel the world using their cryptocurrency. CheapAir is a popular website that has been offering customers the ability to pay for their airfares using Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash and Litecoin. While we���re on the topic of travel, some of the world���s richest have been lucky enough to attend world-renowned entrepreneur Richard Branson���s annual blockchain summit on his very own Necker Island. The Necker Blockchain Summit is an invite-only event which brings together some of the greatest minds to innovate and foster the growth of blockchain technology around the world. If you want to check out where the richest in the world ��� including crypto-made millionaires ��� hang out, check out Cointelegraph���s prestigious list. Perhaps one of the most intriguing ways you can spend cryptocurrency is by enrolling at a university and then paying for your tuition fees with Bitcoin.  Cumbria University in England has been allowing students to pay for their education with Bitcoin since 2014. Cointelegraph has confirmed that this payment option is still available, although the popularity of the option has waned in recent years. The University of Nicosia in Cyprus was the first in the world to offer students the option of paying fees with Bitcoin. You can also do the same at the European School of Management and Technology, which began accepting payment in BTC in 2017. A common theme in the arguments against cryptocurrency adoption has been the obvious barrier to entry when it comes to day-to-day use of digital currencies. Many argue that it is difficult to actually use cryptocurrency for everyday items like grocery shopping or other menial expenses. While this may be the case, there have been moves in the right direction in all sorts of places. For one, the ever-growing number of cryptocurrency ATMs, which allow people to draw cash in exchange for crypto, makes it possible to use your crypto to pay for goods in a fairly quick manner. What is more, the crypto ATM market is expected to grow exponentially in the next five years, according to reports published in September. While the crypto markets have endured a testing year so far, these type of developments show that there is a steadily growing market of consumers that are looking to actively use cryptocurrency to settle payments. Whether it���s cars, property, flights or a ticket to the Super Bowl, cryptocurrencies can and have been the answer for some. The only question is when this will snowball into an everyday phenomenon.	1
Bitcoin has fallen 11.23 percent in the 24 hours to press time Monday, Feb. 5, dropping below support at $8000 as its price continues to dictate altcoin performance. Data from Coin360 Monday shows a continuation of lacklustre price action for the largest cryptocurrency, which saw its slight rebound Saturday, Feb. 4 all but erased over the weekend.  Image source: coin360.io On Coinbase, Bitstamp and some other exchanges, Bitcoin failed to maintain $8000 into Monday, hovering at around $7900 at press time, about $275 off Friday���s multi-month lows of $7625. Friday���s dip triggered a short-term uptick that saw prices gain over $1200 in a single hour, enthusiasm appearing to dampen once again after passing $9000. On social media, cryptocurrency traders remained more steadfast than ever in their faith about both Bitcoin and altcoin perspectives. John McAfee, who has championed Bitcoin and recently begun focussing on specific altcoins, told Twitter followers to ���get a perspective��� in the face of falling value. ���In a long term view, (Bitcoin) is still climbing. Forget about these short term ups and downs,��� he continued. Please God people - get a perspective about the market! The price of Bitcoin today is still higher than it was just three months ago! In a long term view, Bicoin is still climbing. Forget about these short term ups and downs. If you are a short term investor, you need to get real Adding some perspective on the overall red-washed market, CNBC���s Ran Neuner tweeted yesterday that the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies today is the same as it was in December, 2017: Worried that the market is crashing? Bear in mind that today we are at a market cap of $400bn and that the first time the crypto market hit $400bn was 6 December. So we are back at levels from 2 months ago. The market cap is also up 20x since this time last year. At press time, the total market cap according to CoinMarketCap was around $369 million, about the same level as it was Dec. 6, 2017:  Altcoin-focused accounts also cautioned traders against paying attention to coins��� value in USD or other fiat currency terms. Others were more bullish, using various methods as proof a more serious upturn was the most likely short-term future for Bitcoin. There are two cases of Elliot Wave that can both be correct. We must state both cases and differentiate the two, while finding similarities. Both cases have an uptrend regardless, so we must assume an uptrend is imminent either way. pic.twitter.com/U2uuQEZUvz	2
Ripple (XRP) has overtaken Ethereum as the largest altcoin by market cap in a surge which has divided the cryptocurrency community. After the payment network���s token reached as much as $2.65 on some exchanges this week, investors are celebrating returns which have topped 1,000 percent in just three weeks. At the start of December, XRP traded at just $0.24. Multiple altcoins have seen astronomical gains towards the end of this year as Bitcoin���s own surge fueled copycat behavior which saw new all-time highs for assets including Monero, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. With a market cap of $91 bln at press time Saturday, however, it is XRP that has stolen the show from Ethereum, which currently has a market cap of $68 bln. Meanwhile, Bitcoin���s overall market share has sunk to new all-time lows below 38 percent. Reasons for Ripple���s rise revolve around new partnerships with traditional finance, institutions keen to leverage its technology to cut costs and save time. Despite its newfound successes, however, Bitcoin figures appear wearier than ever, highlighting the project���s centralized structure and comparative lack of use cases for XRP versus the platform itself. ���There is a clear mispricing here between the (past) and the (future),��� BitFury CEO George Kikvadze commented on Twitter Friday. Ripple - Centralised Solution; Trust in One Company - Worth $100Bln?   Bitcoin - Decentralised Solution; Trust in Mathematics and Cryptography - Worth $235Bln?   There is a clear mispricing here between the PAST and the FUTURE Popular personality WhalePanda meanwhile went further, comparing Ripple���s ethos in terms of bonafide Blockchain qualities to notorious MMM scheme OneCoin. If you really believe Ripple, which isnt even a blockchain project, is the future of cryptocurrencies... then I have some Bitconnect and Onecoin to sell to you. Placeholder VC���s Chris Burniske and Blockchain technologist Preston Byrne also voiced concerns about the rate of XRP���s growth.	2
In a letter to investors released on July 29, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead noted that the United States has printed a shocking amount of money to combat the pandemic-induced financial crisis. ���The United States printed more money in June than in the first two centuries after its founding,��� Morehead wrote. ���Last month the U.S. budget deficit ��� $864 billion ��� was larger than the total debt incurred from 1776 through the end of 1979.��� Morehead made it clear that Pantera Capital sees Bitcoin as the solution for the current crisis. He also contrasted the effects of money printing in recent months, to how the equivalent amount of currency had performed across centuries: ���With that first trillion [USD printed] we defeated British imperialists, bought Alaska and the Louisiana Purchase, defeated fascism, ended the Great Depression, built the Interstate Highway System, and went to the Moon.��� Morehead cited the resulting inflation as the main reason one should ���get out of paper money and into Bitcoin.��� According to the CEO, ���there is no need for inflation-adjusted numbers [with Bitcoin] because there is no inflation/hyper-inflation.��� Goldbug Peter Schiff is also concerned about the effects of money printing. He noted comments by the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who said this week that the Fed was using its ���full range of tools��� to respond to the pandemic: printing money, keeping interest rates close to zero, and making asset purchases steady at $120 billion per month. ���The U.S. is about to experience one of the greatest inflationary periods in world history,��� Schiff said on Twitter. ���Any credibility the Fed has left will be lost. Federal Reserve Notes soon won't be worth a Continental.��� (Continental paper money in the U.S. was at one time exchanged for treasury bonds at 1% of its face value.) Despite widespread fears over inflation, many experts predict consumer prices will actually go into a period of deflation ��� and that���s exactly what���s happened in Australia this week where ABC News reported that consumer prices in the country actually dropped 1.9% in June. It���s a record for deflation since the Korean War. However many pundits believe the inflation is actually hidden in asset prices, rather than consumer prices, and that money printing has underpinned the share market rally in the midst of the pandemic.  Pantera Capital revealed its simple investment strategy for riding out the pandemic: ���Stay long crypto until schools/daycare open. Until then the economy won���t function and money will be continuously printed.���	2
The controversial SegWit2x Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork will go ahead on Dec. 28, according to the project���s official website. The SegWit2x project, which caused months of debate and infighting among the Bitcoin community prior to its last-minute cancellation in November, now says it will fork off at block 501451, due in around two days��� time. The project���s Founder and Lead Developer, Jaap Terlouw, stated on their site that the fork aims to address issues of ���commission and transaction speed within the Bitcoin network,��� adding that currently, Bitcoin is ���almost impossible to use as a means of payment.��� Confirmation that the hard fork will, in fact, take place is indicated both in the roadmap on the project���s site, as well as in a direct quote from Terlouw: ���Our team will carry out the Bitcoin hard fork, which was planned for mid-November.��� The founder also promised that in addition to the common practice of crediting BTC holders with equivalent balances of the new coin (B2X), they would also receive ���a proportional number of Satoshi Nakamoto���s Bitcoins as a reward for their commitment to progress.��� In total, eight exchanges are listed as official supporters of the fork. The project���s roadmap includes features such as Lightning Network support, smart contracts and, ultimately, anonymous transactions. In the past six weeks, Bitcoin Cash, another Bitcoin hard fork formed in August, has become the central talking point of the industry, as it sees remarkable growth and sparks shifts in mining and investment behavior, affecting Bitcoin���s price. The latest incarnation of SegWit2x has so far received comparatively little publicity. However, the website copy conspicuously name-dropped one particular exchange, HitBTC. Speaking about existing SegWit2x futures, Terlouw is quoted on the site as saying: ���At the same time, trading of its [SegWit2x] futures has been carried out on some exchanges for a long time. HitBTC is among them.��� When the project first saw hints of a comeback on Dec. 19, futures prices of B2X coins saw an uptick from under $200 to almost $600, a trend which has remained steady prior to the launch. Meanwhile, on Christmas Day, a Blockchain Angel Investor debuted his own ���version��� of Bitcoin, Bitcoin God (GOD), while several other forks are due to join the ecosystem in the coming weeks. For BTC investors, a key appeal of new Bitcoin ���versions��� or hard forks  is the duplication of their BTC holdings in the new coin at the time of each snapshot, which essentially provides them with a supply of ���free money.���	0
Disclaimer: In light of feedback received about this article, Cointelegraph would like to reiterate that Bitcoin Classic is not the original Bitcoin chain, but an altcoin. Bitcoin Classic has confirmed it is shutting down as developers claim Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will become ���Bitcoin��� by May 2018. In an official statement Thursday, release manager Tom Zander praised BCH and said its validity meant that Bitcoin Classic had ���fulfilled its promise.��� ���It is now up to you which chain will gain the most traction. It is now up to the next billion people to start to use Bitcoin Cash. In at most six months I'm sure we'll just drop the ���Cash��� and call it ���Bitcoin,������ he stated. BCH shot up in price over 35 percent in anticipation of a new hard fork set for Nov. 13, reaching its highest value almost since it debuted. In the aftermath of SegWit2x���s apparent failure, funds appear to be flowing into the rival Bitcoin fork as investors hedge bets over a duplicate chain appearing. ���The fact that the Legacy chain is stuck at 1 MB, and likely always will be, confirms the Cash chain's viability. Now the market will decide,��� Zander added. Until news of the hard fork, BCH had largely held a sideline position beyond significant publicity efforts led by Bitcoin.com���s Roger Ver. Now, further public support is coming from cryptocurrency figures including Rick Falkvinge, founder of the Finnish Pirate Party and regulator commentator. With recent developments, I'm putting all available dev resources to retool my software for #Bitcoin Cash. I suspect I'm far from alone. Ver himself this week also confirmed Bitcoin.com would only advocate and deal in BCH. #CT_questions Do you think #BitcoinCash will become the official '#Bitcoin'? Bitcoin Classic is a fork of Bitcoin that was initially launched on February 10, 2016. The soon-to-be-defunct project���s aim was to increase the transaction capacity of Bitcoin by increasing the block size limit.	0
The Blue House, the executive office and official residence of the South Korean President, has announced that there will be no cryptocurrency trading ban in the short-term. In an official announcement, South Korean government reaffirms there will be NO TRADING BAN for #cryptocurrency market in the short term and NOTHING IS FINALIZED.   A petition to fire the head of the Ministry of Justice over the #cryptocurrency trading fiasco filed. pic.twitter.com/tb5tDvIV2K The South Korean government���s official announcement came after a massive backlash and criticism against the Ministry of Justice, which independently announced its plans of banning cryptocurrency trading. The Ministry did this without the consent of the Ministry of Strategy and Justice and other government agencies involved in the South Korean cryptocurrency regulation task force. According to the Blue House, more than 60,000 citizens voted in a petition to fire the head of the Ministry of Justice Park Sang-ki, who released a premature statement earlier today, on January 11, that the government will implement a policy to shut down cryptocurrency trading. Almost immediately after Minister Park released his statement, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance emphasized that it does not support or agree with the decision of the Ministry of Justice to ban cryptocurrency trading. It also added that the Ministry of Strategy and Finance only found out about the statement of Minister Park through media reports, and the decision to ban cryptocurrency trading was not agreed upon by the task force. In 2016, former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who is currently in jail for money laundering and corruption charges, was impeached by the people of the country who strongly voiced out their opposition against the former president. Millions of South Korean citizens came out to the streets and surrounded the Blue House, until the court decided to finally process the impeachment. Since then, the voice of the South Korean citizens has strengthened and the new government, led by the current President Moon Jae-in, vowed to listen to the people. In consideration of past events and the government���s announcement that cryptocurrency trading ban will not implemented in the short-term, it is likely that the South Korean government will move towards regulating and fostering the local cryptocurrency market. Previously, a spokesperson from the South Korean cryptocurrency task force stated that the country will follow the regulatory roadmap set by major regions like Japan and the US. Hence, it is highly unlikely that even in the long-term, a cryptocurrency trading ban will be imposed. The spokesperson said: ���The South Korean government has no other choice but to follow the regulatory frameworks and trends established by other leading governments. While there certainly exists a negative reputation attached to the cryptocurrencies, the government���s stance is to allow what has to be allowed, for the benefit of the South Korean market.���	2
What looked too good to be true ended up being just that, as Bitconnect has all but closed its doors. Long accused of being a Ponzi-scheme, Bitconnect shut down its cryptocurrency exchange and lending service this week. As stated on their website, Bitconnect had received cease and desist letters from two American securities regulators - leading to the closure of their lending and exchange platforms. Still, Bitconnect will continue to run its website and wallet service. Since its inception in January 2017, many were skeptical about Bitconnect services. In essence, one needed to send Bitconnect Bitcoin in exchange for Bitconnect Coin (BCC) on their exchange. Once you had BCC, you were guaranteed ���up to 120 percent return per year.��� Users were told they were earning interest by holding their coin ���for helping maintain the security of the network.���  Source: Bitconnect.co Bitconnect���s lending platform is what really led to accusations of a Ponzi scheme, as well as cease and desist orders from regulators.  Source: Bitconnect.co As the above illustration explains, users bought BCC with Bitcoin and then lent out their BCC on the Bitconnect lending software. Users would receive varying percentages of interest depending on the amount of BCC they had lent.  Source: Bitconnect.co Add in the referral system seen in many other Ponzi schemes and the fact that the operation was run anonymously; it's hardly surprising that this whole endeavor has ended in tears. The lending scheme was the main draw card of Bitconnect because of its huge promise of returns. In order to participate in the scheme, you had to buy BCC - which saw the token hit an all-time high of $437.31 per BCC before it plummeted in value following the closure this week. That being said, the cryptocurrency is still alive and trading at around $35 at the time of writing.  Following Bitconnect���s closure, social media was abuzz with sentiments of ���I told you so.��� TenX co-founder Julian Hosp highlighted the fact that BCC was still trading as a real head-scratcher. Everything that's wrong with crypto in one picture! #bitconnect #scam #ponzi #cryptocurrencies #bubble pic.twitter.com/t5o9Nm1rZ4 Francis Pouliot shared a hilarious video of a Bitconnect meet which had been slightly dubbed over. People invested billions of dollars in this   (This video is actually hilarious recommended for memephiles) https://t.co/Jpb8xpJsx7 American cartoonist Spike Trotman shared one of the most entertaining and eerily accurate predictions back in September 2017, postulating that Bitconnect was indeed a Ponzi scheme. Her latest tweet is a screenshot of the Bitconnect Reddit page, with subreddits for a suicide hotline as well as a massive legal action megathread. Do yourself a favor and take a look at Iron Spike���s full threat on Bitconnect - it���s brilliant.

Jordan Belfort, known colloquially as the ���Wolf of Wall Street���, has yet again cast doubt on Bitcoin, this time in a video interview with entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David, posted on Bet-David���s Facebook Jan. 31. Belfort told Bet-David that he doesn���t believe Bitcoin (BTC) itself is a scam, referring to it as the creation of ���financial anarchists���. He does think, however, that the way the cryptocurrency was built is a ���perfect storm for manipulation���. Belfort believes that the rising price of BTC can be attributed to wild speculation because of what he sees as improper use of the cryptocurrency: ���Something [BTC] was designed to be used as a currency, and it���s being used as an investment vehicle [...] As a currency, Bitcoin is no more useful at $20,000 or $100.��� Belfort spoke negatively about the potential for manipulating crypto markets due to the thinness of the market, specifically referencing the case of Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early adopter of BTC who was paid in crypto when working at Coinbase in 2013. According to Belfort, Carlson-Wee sold all of his Bitcoin, bought Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and then gave a televised interview saying that BTC was dead and that Bitcoin Cash was the future, causing its price to skyrocket. CT could not confirm that Carlson-Wee ever mentioned dumping all of his BTC for BCH, although he did give an interview to CNBC about Ethereum that some Reddit users misconstrued as Carlson-Wee moving all his holdings to Ether. Belfort predicts that while Bitcoin is, in his words, a ���wolf in sheep���s clothing,���  it also ���might go to $50,000��� before what he is certain will be its eventual fall to zero. In September 2017, Belfort had said that Bitcoin was problematic because of the potential ease for hackers to steal virtual currency. In October, he commented that ICOs were the ���biggest scams ever���. Belfort told Bet-David he had invested ���not a penny��� in cryptocurrency.	0
US-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase sent an official notice Friday, Feb. 23 to approximately 13,000 of its customers whose information it is legally required to turn over to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS had initially asked Coinbase in July 2017 to hand over even more detailed information on every one of its then over 500,000 users in an attempt catch those cheating on their taxes. However, another court order in Nov. 2017 reduced this number to around 14,000 ���high-transacting��� users, which the platform now reports as 13,000, in what Coinbase calls a ���partial, but still significant, victory for Coinbase and its customers.��� On Friday, Coinbase told the around 13,000 affected customers that the company would be providing their taxpayer ID, name, birth date, address, and historical transaction records from 2013-2015 to the IRS within 21 days. Coinbase���s letter to these customers encourages them ���to seek legal advice from an attorney promptly��� if they have any questions. Their website also states that concerns may also be addressed on Coinbase���s Taxes FAQ. The ongoing legal battle between Coinbase and the US government dates back to November, 2016, when the IRS filed a ���John Doe summons��� in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On Feb. 13, personal finance service Credit Karma released data showing that only 0.04 percent of their customers had reported cryptocurrencies on their federal tax returns so far this tax season.	0
2017 proved to be a breakout year for cryptocurrencies as a whole as investors saw massive returns on gains made, especially in Bitcoin and Ethereum. A 1,000 percent appreciation in value from January to December made Bitcoin the major player in the market, but investors who entered the market last year have nothing on early Bitcoin adopters in the years following its creation in 2009. Those who got their hands on Bitcoin before 2014, where its price fluctuated between $100 all the way up to a $1,000 high, are the real winners. Considering the preeminent cryptocurrency was available for less than $100 for at least four years, early investors will have got their hands on hundreds and thousands of Bitcoin before its meteoric rise in value. The list of supposed Bitcoin billionaires puts a spotlight on the biggest holders of the virtual currency, but there are likely to be thousands of people holding onto a small fortune in Bitcoin.  Many early adopters like to promote the ���hodl��� lifestyle, refusing to sell any of their Bitcoin at any cost. It's hard to argue against them having seen the rise of Bitcoin over the past 12 months. However, early Bitcoin investor and well-known venture capitalist Fred Wilson insists that investors with a large amount of Bitcoin would be wise to practice profit taking, as reported by CNBC this week. ���If you are sitting on 20x, 50x, 100x your money on a crypto investment, it would not be a mistake to sell 10 percent, 20 percent or even 30 percent of your position. Selling 25 percent of your position on an investment that is up 50x is booking a 12.5x on the entire investment while allowing you to keep 75 percent of it going. I know that many crypto holders think that selling anything is a mistake. And it might be. Or it might not be. You just don���t know.��� Wilson posted the advice on his personal blog, in a post grappling with the difficulties of managing a venture capitalist portfolio. The 56-year-old is the founder of Union Square Ventures, which has stakes in a number of technology companies including the likes of Twitter. Wilson���s sentiments come at an interesting juncture. The past three weeks have been tumultuous for the cryptocurrency market. Marred by volatility, the markets have seen wild price fluctuations with many virtual currencies affected. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are caught in a massive bull vs. bear market, as investors look to book profits and stop losses as often as possible. Nevertheless, Wilson offers some sage advice ahead of an exciting 2018, as more mainstream financial institutions iron out plans to enter the market in different ways. The CBE and CMOE have blazed the trail for Bitcoin Futures, and the likes of the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and Goldman Sachs are all preparing to launch their own offerings in the next few months. Coupled with the massive influx of users looking to open cryptocurrency accounts, the outlook seems bright, even amidst constantly changing market values.	2
An address with the foresight to purchase $3,400 worth of Shiba Inu (SHIB) last August has seen the value of the coins grow to a whopping $1.55 billion on Thursday. In total, the unknown person has bought SHIB 44 times since August 2020 ��� with $3,200 as the largest purchase at any one time ��� and their total holding of 70,200,003,107,594 SHIB is now worth $5.63 billion. After the wallet address was shared on Twitter, user Untraceable questioned whether the SHIB market was liquid enough to ���absorb $5.7b if this wallet sells?��� According to Etherscan, the anonymous SHIB hodler purchased the dog-themed token on nine occasions in August 2020, spending a total of $3,400 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (wETH) that month. As the price of SHIB has since gained more than 94,278,239.8% over the past year to sit at $0.00008094 at the time of writing, the hodler has become a crypto billionaire from their August purchases alone. According to data from CoinGecko, the total market capitalization of SHIB is now worth $40.3 billion. The asset���s mammoth 1,063% gain in value over the past 30 days has seen SHIB oust the beloved Dogecoin (DOGE) it was modeled on as a top 10-ranked coin. By CoinGecko's measurement, $SHIB has definitively flippened $DOGE. An absolutely historic day for memecoins https://t.co/z5GZ0w4X8c pic.twitter.com/ag55OqQMlK At the time of writing, SHIB is currently ranked ninth, while DOGE is sitting at 11th with a market cap of $31.6 billion. The flippening of DOGE has sparked a new meme online in which people are calling Dogecoin a ���boomer meme coin.��� Is doge a boomer coin now? Earlier on Thursday, Cointelegraph���s market team reported on three reasons behind the bullish momentum of SHIB, pointing at an increase of user access via listings on multiple crypto exchanges, the launch of the Shiba Inu���s own nonfungible token project dubbed ���Shiboshi���s,��� and a surge in futures open interest on multiple exchanges, including OKEx, FTX and Huobi. While SHIB has seen a meteoric rise of late, DOGE���s appreciation fails to match up in comparison, with the elder memecoin gaining a mere 18.5% over the past 30 days to sit at $0.23.	2
Bitcoin and altcoins lost up to 40% of their value the morning of Tuesday, Jan. 16, as regulatory pressure from China and South Korea appears to upset optimism. Cross-exchange data from CoinMarketCap reveals the extent of bear sentiment arising from the confused situation in Seoul and the news of additional trading sanctions from Beijing. On Monday, Cointelegraph reported on how Korean authorities would likely stop short of an outright cryptocurrency exchange ���shutdown,��� but had introduced fines for users unwilling to use personal identification data on crypto exchanges in the country. At the same time, China is looking to expand the scope of its September crypto exchange ban to ���end��� centralized trading for Bitcoin and altcoins in all forms, various sources now report. As of press time, Bitcoin has lost almost 15% on the news, while the majority of major altcoin assets fared considerably worse, dipping between 20% and 30%, some of the top 30 coins even seeing 40% losses. Bitcoin Cash, which had seen significant price advances in the first part of January, has fallen below $2000. Ripple stood at $1.36 at press time - less than half of its Jan. 4 high over $3. Reactions to the events show what has become a standard selection in the cryptocurrency sphere and beyond. Traders lick their wounds, pundits suggest the price correction is a ���healthy��� one, while a flurry of mainstream media articles hints at the bursting of the cryptocurrency ���bubble��� yet again. The amount of money waiting to come in makes a prolonged bear market close to impossible. EVERYONE that matters is looking into crypto right now. And it is really everyone. On the subject of future positivity, this week���s Wall Street bonus allocation, tipped to spark a mass influx of cash into cryptocurrency markets, comes at a time when the potential for short-term profit is all the more visible.	0
With the surging price of cryptocurrencies, demand has reached the point where cryptocurrency exchanges are completely swamped. This massive influx of users has led to major infrastructure concerns leading to the temporary closure of their registration portals. Throughout the last half of 2017, digital currency exchanges have posted record numbers of user signup. Binance is reporting the addition of 250,000 users per day while Coinbase has reported numerous days of 100,000+ user signups and Kraken boasts of 50,000 new users per day. The incredible swelling of cryptocurrency users is overwhelming the infrastructure of many cryptocurrency exchanges, with some such as Kraken experiencing major usability problems throughout 2017. The exchange has responded by disabling some of its advanced order types, reducing price precision and initiating a major system overhaul. Bittrex is one of the first exchange platforms that put a halt on onboarding new users. Back in December 2017, an alert from this US-based exchange reads: ���We have received an enormous number of new account registrations over the past few weeks.��� In addition to Bittrex, two other platforms had to make a similar decision ��� Bitfinex and Binance. New signups to Bitfinex will be welcomed by a window stating that new account creation has been paused. Part of the message reads: ���Thank you for your interest in opening a Bitfinex account. However, due to extraordinary demand, new account creation has been temporarily paused. Bitfinex focuses on serving professional traders. The reason we have decided to temporarily stop accepting new accounts is that we cannot undermine the quality of our services for our existing traders by flooding the system with new, small accounts.��� Binance has also had to halt registrations while undergoing an infrastructure update. While Bittrex and Binance have not given a timeline for reopening new account registrations, Bitfinex intends to allow signups starting January 15, 2018.	0
On the morning of Jan. 4, the cryptocurrency TRON (TRX) posted 136 percent growth, becoming the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and pushing Dash to 11th place. The altcoin has been on a bullish trend since mid-December, growing well over 2,000 percent since then. In the first week of 2018 alone, the coin has seen almost 300 percent growth. TRON hit $0.20 earlier today, and is currently trading at an average of $0.17, with a market cap of $12.4 bln at press time.  TRON markets itself as a Blockchain-based protocol for the entertainment industry -- a platform for content distribution in which TRON���s native token, TRX, is circulated. The project ran an ICO in early September, hitting their fundraising goal of $70 mln. TRX has been trading since mid-September. In the past few days, the founder and CEO of TRON, Justin Sun, has posted a couple of tantalizing tweets that hint at upcoming partnerships, without disclosing any names or details. On Jan. 2, Sun tweeted about potential partnerships with ���giant companies���, noting boldly ���We will be huge soon!���. More partnerships are coming! Even #NASDAQ listed companies and the giant companies with more than 100 million users started to contact us for partnership. We will be huge soon! #TRON #TRX $TRX Early morning Jan. 4, Sun followed up with a second teaser tweet about an upcoming ���prestigious��� partnership to be announced next week. We will announce our partnership with a very prestigious public listed company next week. Looking forward to it! On Dec. 31, Sun predicted that his project���s cryptocurrency would break into the top ten in 2018, a feat it managed to accomplish in just the first four days of the year.

Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding today, Feb. 3, following yesterday���s multi-month low in Bitcoin's price. Most of the top 50 coins are in green, with 24 hour gains over 20 percent.   In part due to pressure from misleading reporting on regulations in India, the overall cryptocurrency market took a massive nosedive starting Thursday, Feb.1, shedding more than $100 billion in market cap in the 24 hours following the news. However, after the substantial selloff, the market has spent  today bouncing back, with Bitcoin rising back above the $9,000 level. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at an average of $9,095, up 3.54 percent on the day.  Image source: coin360.io Following Bitcoin���s lead, other coins have also rallied substantially. With the except of three coins, every top 50 cryptocurrency has seen gains, with Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA), and Verge (XVG) leading the pack with gains between 15 and 20 percent. A quick glance at the Coin360 market snapshot indicates a clear positive turn after the substantial negatives of the week.  Image source: coin360.io Despite the market lows this week, figures such as Litecoin founder Charlie Lee and CNBC���s Cryptotrader host Ran Neuner have made bullish statements recently about Bitcoin. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Lee in particular offered some level-headed perspective on volatility in crypto markets, often lacking in a market crowded with fearful newcomers. News of the first Canadian Blockchain ETF approval may well have played into today���s rally. Bitcoin hit a record high of 20,000 in late December, only to crash, along with the rest of the market, just a few days later, Dec. 22, when Bitcoin and altcoins lost 20-30 percent.   Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has yet to fully recover, hovering roughly between $10-$15,000 per coin, until this yesterday���s multi-month lows under $8000. The entire month of January saw a market sell off, in part due to increased regulatory news from South Korea ��� and misleading reporting on it ��� that left many investors fearful.	2
Blockchain technology continues to disrupt many major industries worldwide. By changing the way people interact and do business, Blockchain is leading us to a new ���digital reality.��� Social media is an important tool to staying connected. Blockchain is taking social media to the next level, by changing the means of content distribution, revenue generation and data security. Melvin Petties, Blockchain evangelist, explains: ���Blockchain gives social media a new way to express social status and connection as a currency or tradeable asset.��� In much the same way as carbon credits work, we might eventually see a world in which social favors are tracked and referenced, then traded. He notes that platforms like LinkedIn could easily implement something like this to help people measure the true depth of their support network. Blockchain technology also offers privacy features. Internet and mobile users have been taught to expect constant privacy violations. However, Blockchain technology can be used to regain this lost privacy. Jade Mulholland, Founder and Lead Developer of the social network alternative with advanced privacy Nexus, tells Cointelegraph: ���By decentralizing and encrypting all downloads and uploads, all [privacy] invasions that large companies and corporations are currently performing are eliminated, end-to-end encryption ensures that only the sender and receiver can read the messages between themselves.��� Mulholland explains Blockchain enables the creation of such system without sacrificing the various benefits that exist within other networks such as posting, making comments, sharing of posts, tagging people and so on. "Our reality is now digital,��� says Derin Cag, Board Member at Humaniq. Cag explains that there are new tools for mass communication and societal influence which are shifting the paradigm. In addition to ���old media��� such as newspapers, radio and TV, we now have social media. Digital platforms such as Facebook and Twitter provide nearly everybody to reach an international audience at a very low cost. Cag says: ���Although the mainstream social media platforms make billions each year from advertising revenues, they do not reward their users financially. Blockchain technology is transforming this by paying people their fair-share to post things, such as in the case of Steem.it. The next frontier in terms of Blockchain technology developments in mass communications will most likely be in decentralization.��� Cag also explains that there will be a complete democratization of access to information with upcoming platforms on distributed ledgers. Such ledgers depend on Blockchain technology and cannot be interrupted, censored or impeded. No dictator, authoritarian regime or snoopy government will have the power to block such platforms without completely switching off the Internet. Nawaf Abdullah, Founder at eBitcoinics believes that the immutability of data stored on the Blockchain is an essential benefit that the technology brings to the social media industry. According to Nawaf: ���Any layman understands Blockchain basically as a ... path that can never be broken, whatever it is that we have on the Blockchain can never be altered and this establishes the concept of trust when it comes to data.��� He notes that social media is all about data and that Blockchain, therefore, improves security and trust by assuring users that content has not been manipulated. Social media is just one area that the Blockchain is revolutionizing. As Blockchain continues to improve various industries, we are likely seeing the beginning of a digital reality. Further disruption appears inevitable.	2
Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, sees the potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to be around for a long time, but with a significant price drop coming when the Bitcoin bubble bursts, according to CNBC. Boockvar sees a possible 70 to 90 percent price drop for Bitcoin this year, saying: ���Over the next year I wouldn���t be surprised if it���s [BTC] down to $1,000 to $3,000.��� When asked if the stock market would crash in the event of a significant fall in Bitcoin���s price, Boockvar said that any corresponding drop would just be psychological, because Bitcoin is ���not something that really is that relevant in a 19 trillion dollar economy.��� However, he adds that people in South Korea, Japan, and the US who have been taking on credit card debt in order to invest in cryptocurrency will be hit hard. Boockvar told CNBC that the boom in crypto markets can be attributed to easy-money policies of central banks and money printing. These moves make some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, more attractive to investors, due to the fact that they are both finite and safe from debasement and inflation. People have long questioned whether Bitcoin fits the mold of a traditional ���bubble.��� Yale economist Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel prize for his work on financial bubbles, used Bitcoin as an example of a bubble in September 2017. However, in January 2018, Shiller then said that he didn���t know what to make of Bitcoin, adding that it could be around for another 100 years. BTC is trading at around $11,820 at press time, down about 1.52 percent over a 24 hour period.	0
Amid a downturn in the cryptocurrency markets, the apparent swathe of Bitcoin sell-offs from a $3 billion Chinese Ponzi scheme could be to blame. On Aug. 14, Dovey Wan ��� founding partner of blockchain-based investment company Primitive Ventures ��� called attention to the ongoing mass sell-offs from the fraudulent Chinese investment scheme, dubbed PlusToken. As Wan outlines, PlusToken was created in mid-2018 and promised high yield investment returns at different rebate percentages to its four tiers of member ��� a classic Ponzi scheme structure. By early 2019, the project claimed to have over 10 million members.  Wan has attached data on all the wallet addresses ��� including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and EOS ��� known to be associated with PlusToken and urgently called on exchanges and over-the-counter platforms to blacklist them.   She notes that Chinese police hunted down a core team member of the scheme two months ago and have revealed that investors were scammed of a whopping $3 billion. Alongside the addresses, Wan has attached investigative data from security audit firm Peckshield that reveals the money flow from PlusToken���s wallet as of early July, the date the sell-offs are thought to have begun:  Graph showing PlusToken���s money flow in early July. Source: Peckshield via @DoveyWan Despite the arrest, the cryptocurrency cannot reportedly be rolled back, as Wan explains: ���Many of their BTC addresses are started with P2SH which commonly used for mutil-sig, most likely some ppl who hold the keys are not being caught hence police can���t unlock the wallet. For EOS/ETH wallet can be diff case but so far police was not able to touch any of those.��� In an attempt to curb the impact of the sell-offs, she has recommended that Peckshield and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis analyze the flows more closely, noting that PlusToken appears to be moving their funds in small batches of 50-100 BTC into exchanges.  Chinese traders have reportedly claimed that an unknown address has in recent days been dumping 100 BTC incessantly on crypto exchange Binance, which Wan suspects to be connected to the scheme.  As just reported, the PlusToken scheme was identified as being the largest single incident of loss in a recent summary of 2019 crypto-related theft from blockchain security firm CipherTrace, having purportedly defrauded investors of $2.9 billion.	0
Regardless of where your allegiances lie in the crypto community, homage should be paid to the original Blockchain solution - Bitcoin. However, it has been 10 long years now since Bitcoin came into being (an eternity in the cryptocurrency space) and things are starting to get away from the King. Bitcoin���s path was forever changed in August 2017 when a new challenger stepped up to the plate amid the rapidly escalating scaling debate. Bitcoin Cash appeared with its backers claiming it to be the one true ruler. Not long after this came Segwit 2x's failure to launch, which essentially confirmed Bitcoin���s status as digital gold. As a digital gold, it may have no rivals, but in the world of cryptocurrency it may have played its last move. Scaling is a constant topic for evolving cryptocurrencies, and if Bitcoin cannot scale properly soon, it could be abandoned by investors for a more forward thinking cryptocurrency. After bringing in millions of users to the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin has hit a log jam on its network as available blocks fill up with transactions quicker than they can be mined. This backlog has led to higher transaction fees and longer waiting times. These factors all end up being counterproductive to the principles underpinning cryptocurrency which are to eliminate the power that banks have over money. Banking fees and centralised waiting times are part and parcel of the irritation that comes from another entity being in control of one's money. Bitcoin is increasingly picking up these bad habits, leaving its users with a feeling of d��j�� vu harking back to the days when banks held a monopoly over monetary services. Bitcoin���s move towards digital gold was a communal decision, and therefore blame cannot really be laid purely on the currency���s shoulders. But in that short time, frustrations amongst investors have grown with regards to the scaling issues. There are other currencies waiting to try and take the mantle away from Bitcoin, and already this has been demonstrated as Bitcoin suffers a 50 percent drop in market dominance since November. Currently, market share for Bitcoin is just over 33 percent, having not too long ago been at over 60. Bitcoin Cash is the most direct competitor to Bitcoin, trying to replace it as a ���peer-to-peer electronic cash system���, as outlined in its white paper. However Bitcoinc has more than just its potential replacements to worry about, as the adoption rate of the currency is reversing. Bitcoin once held sway over a number of large companies who had adopted it as a form of electronic payment, but have since reneged on their adoption. Steam, formerly a strong supporter, no longer accepts Bitcoin, while Microsoft caused confusion when they looked to stop accepting only to rebut this and state: ���Microsoft has restored Bitcoin as a payment option after working with our provider to ensure lower Bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers.��� As companies turn away from Bitcoin, even some of the more established names in cryptocurrency join the march for the door. Civic CEO Vinny Lingham, who is well respected for his opinions in the crypto community said: ���When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold.��� There are currently plans underway for the oldest and most well-known digital coin to try and overcome this scaling issue. Some of the solutions being considered include the Lightning Network, or major upgrades to the network like changing block sizes. Lightning Network, a technology which is being tested slowly but surely on the Bitcoin network, involves taking the transactions off-chain and opening payment channels. With these transactions taking place off chain, the result is an almost instantaneous transaction, at a much cheaper rate. This kind of upgrade will require a lot of consensus, and will need to undergo a lot more testing and proof before it becomes entrenched and usable on a large scale, which is another issue that Bitcoin has. Even the idea of making big changes to the network could again fail and flounder. We have already seen this with the failure of the Segwit2x potential upgrade. Bigger blocks could solve the problem, but then Bitcoin will essentially going down the same path as Bitcoin Cash, and with too many staunch supporters in the community, this is unlikely to happen. Bitcoin is well entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, and will likely be a leading currency for a good while more as people refer to Bitcoin first before anything else. But, as the community matures, explores, and demands more, Bitcoin could be in trouble. Changes need to happen, and while Bitcoin will not fall on its sword too soon, if it does not make changes, then the potential for failure will continue to increase.	1
US cybersecurity firm Recorded Future has released a new report linking Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group, to various South Korean cryptocurrency exchange hacking attacks and security breaches. In a report entitled ���North Korea Targeted South Korean Cryptocurrency Users and Exchange in Late 2017 Campaign,��� the firm���s researchers stated that the same type of malware used in the Sony Pictures security breach and WannaCry ransomware attack was utilized to target Coinlink, a South Korea-based cryptocurrency exchange. ���North Korean government actors, specifically Lazarus Group, continued to target South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges and users in late 2017, before Kim Jong Un���s New Year���s speech and subsequent North-South dialogue. The malware employed shared code with Destover malware, which was used against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 and the first WannaCry victim in February 2017,��� the report read. In February 2017, Bithumb, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the global market by daily trading volume, fell victim to a security breach that led to the loss of around $7 mln of user funds, mostly in Bitcoin and Ethereum���s native cryptocurrency Ether. The report released by Recorded Future noted that the $7 mln Bithumb security breach has been linked to North Korean hackers. Insikt Group researchers, a group of cybersecurity researchers that closely track the activities of North Korean hackers regularly, revealed that Lazarus Group, in particular, has used a wide range of tools from spear phishing attacks to malware distribution through communication platforms to gain access to cryptocurrency wallets and accounts. Insikt Group researchers disclosed that Lazarus Group hackers initiated a massive malware campaign in the fall of 2017 and since then, North Korean hackers have focused on spreading malware by attaching files containing fraudulent software to gain access to individual devices. One method Lazarus Group employed was the distribution of Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files through email, the South Korea equivalent of Microsoft Word documents, with malware attached. If any cryptocurrency user downloads the malware, it autonomously installs itself and operates in the background, taking control of or manipulating data stored within the specific device.  ���By 2017, North Korean actors had jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. The first known North Korean cryptocurrency operation occurred in February 2017, with the theft of $7 mln (at the time) in cryptocurrency from South Korean exchange Bithumb. By the end of 2017, several researchers had reported additional spear phishing campaigns against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, numerous successful thefts, and even Bitcoin and Monero mining,��� Insikt Group researchers wrote. Prior to the release of Recorded Future���s report, several other cybersecurity firms had accused North Korean hacking groups of targeting South Korean cryptocurrency trading platforms with sophisticated malware and phishing attack tools. Researchers at FireEye linked six targeted cyber attacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges to state-financed hackers based in North Korea. Most recently, as Cointelegraph reported, police investigators and the Korea Internet and Security Agency initiated a full investigation into a security breach that led to the bankruptcy of YouBit, a South Korean cryptocurrency trading platform. At the time, local investigators stated that they have found evidence to link the YouBit security breach to North Korean hackers. FireEye senior analyst Luke McNamara also told Bloomberg that similar tools widely utilized by North Korean hackers were employed in the YouBit hacking attack. ���This an adversary that we have been watching become increasingly capable and also brazen in terms of the targets that they are willing to go after. This is really just one prong in a larger strategy that they seem to be employing since at least 2016, where they have been using capability that has been primarily used for espionage to actually steal funds.���	2
The popular exchange and wallet platform Coinbase has refuted recent rumors that Ripple (XRP) or other cryptocurrencies will soon be integrated into GDAX, its flagship digital currency exchange. CEO Brian Armstrong firmly stated that neither Coinbase and GDAX have made a decision to integrate any cryptocurrency or digital asset in the short-term. The company said in a blog post: ���A committee of internal experts is responsible for determining whether and when new assets will be added to the platform in accordance with our framework. These individuals ��� and all employees at Coinbase ��� are subject to confidentiality and trading restrictions. As of the date of this statement, we have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company.��� Coinbase���s statement was released following a spate of unverified rumors that claimed GDAX is planning to integrate XRP. The scale of the rumors, which largely circulated on Reddit and Twitter, increased to the point where the company felt the need to refute them, as the price of XRP surged. Immediately after Coinbase issued its statement, the market valuation of XRP decreased from over $148 billion to $126 billion.  Coinbase and GDAX are unlikely to integrate any new assets until they can be certain to prevent any leaks. In early December, when Coinbase added Bitcoin Cash, a Coinbase employee or a contractor reportedly revealed the integration two days prior to the official announcement. Coinbase received significant backlash and criticism from the cryptocurrency community and as a consequence, Armstrong vowed to launch a full investigation. The CEO stated that Coinbase will pursue legal action against the employee or contractor that released confidential information on the company���s digital asset integration plans. As such, the recent statement of Armstrong and rumors around Coinbase���s Ripple integration were also criticized by some of the community���s most prominent experts. These include BitGo lead engineer Jameson Lopp, who tweeted: We haven't made any decisions to add new assets to Coinbase or GDAX at this time. Any statement to the contrary is untrue. Be careful what you believe out there! https://t.co/1yUYG33AoG The investigation into the Bitcoin Cash controversy is still ongoing and until that is completed, it is highly unlikely that Coinbase will pursue the implementation of other cryptocurrencies. The company���s CEO admitted that some insider trading-like movement was spotted in the global Bitcoin Cash exchange market prior to the listing of Coinbase. On December 20, Armstrong wrote: ���Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter. If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies ��� directly or indirectly ��� I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.��� Former Coinbase executive Charlie Lee also stated: ���Coinbase is not adding a new coin anytime soon. There's no reason why they would lie about this... Especially after the flack they got for surprising everyone by adding BCH.���	0
China will add offshore cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO websites to its Great Firewall, the South China Morning Post reported Monday, reported Feb. 5, quoting a publication affiliated with the People���s Bank of China (PBoC). Regulators in China reportedly voiced dissatisfaction with current measures restricting trading on domestic exchange sites, coming to a decision to block foreign sites as well to counter ���financial risks���. In January, a fresh crackdown from Beijing saw fringe trading platforms such as P2P and over-the-counter resources banned, adding to a blanket embargo on crypto-to-fiat trading and ICOs in place since September 2017. At the same time, mixed signals have been given over the status of cryptocurrency mining, while Monday���s website block comes after Cointelegraph reported that ads relating to cryptocurrency had all but disappeared from domestic sites in China. Now lawmakers say they wish to counter contingency moves from traders who sought to circumvent the trading ban by using foreign platforms. ���To prevent financial risks, China will step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs,��� the South China Morning Post quotes the PBoC-related publication as saying. The quote continues: ���ICOs and virtual currency trading did not completely withdraw from China following the official ban��� Overseas transactions and regulatory evasion have resumed��� [R]isks are still there, fuelled by illegal issuance, and even fraud and pyramid selling.���	0
Bitconnect has formally closed its lending platform and cryptocurrency exchange following warnings from Texas and North Carolina regulators. The Bitconnect Coin (BCC) digital currency is down 87% today and 93% from its December 29 high of $437. At press time, BCC is trading for just $30. Many in the digital currency community have called Bitconnect a Ponzi scheme, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, according to TechCrunch. Such accusations were based on the multi-level referral system and the promise of up to 40% earned interest, plus a daily bonus of up to 0.25% per day, on each loan. The promise of risk-free high returns is often typical of a scam - if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Bitconnect Coin���s website describes the currency as: ���The moment you acquire BitConnect Coin it becomes an interest-bearing asset with 120% return per year. It is that simple.��� Unfortunately for investors, that ���interest-bearing asset��� is now nearly worthless.	0
When Ether reaches a price of $2,000, we are looking at a market capitalization of around $188 bln. Although this is significantly higher than today, an eight-time increase, it is still relatively small if we compare it to the market capitalization of a company like Facebook, $492 bln. Cointelegraph attempts to analyze what events need to occur in order for Ether to break this mark. Currently, the Ethereum network is limited to around 20 transactions per second. This is twice as much as Bitcoin can handle. However, if we are looking at a future where Ethereum is used as a daily form of payment, this isn���t enough. The Raiden Network is aiming to solve this problem. Its developers are building an off-chain solution for Ethereum payments which scales linearly with the number of participants. The network could in the future handle over 1,000,000 transactions per second. Additionally, it will allow decreasing transaction cost by seven orders of magnitude, making true micro-transactions on Ethereum a reality. So far there are around 60 active cryptocurrency exchanges. This number is growing every single month as digital assets become more and more attractive. However, the average American is not comfortable with buy and sell limits and trading charts. Therefore, new alternatives need to arise that allow the crowd to acquire Ether. Companies like Dether are working on platforms that allow interested parties to purchase Ether directly with cash. This is definitely a big step in the right direction. At the time I���m writing this article, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined sits at around $110 bln. However, most owners of currencies like Ether and Bitcoin don���t actively spend their coins; they use them as an investment. In order to see Ether at $2,000, more people need to start using it as a form of payment, and more vendors need to start accepting it. This would prove that Ether is a viable method of value exchange. Members of the Ethereum Research and Development team and ZCash are collaborating on a research project addressing privacy on the Blockchain. The integration of the tech behind ZCash into Ethereum is a key milestone. It will allow to completely anonymize transactions and certain components of smart contracts. This would make Ethereum ready to be used in scenarios we can���t even imagine yet. A possible application of this privacy protocol could be in presidential elections or auctions. Once zk-SNARKs is fully integrated, the results of an election or auction could be verified by any observer of the Blockchain, but the individual votes or bids are not revealed. So far, over $1 bln was invested in ICOs by contributors from all over the world. That���s a very impressive figure keeping in mind that this method of funding was practically non-existent before the launch of Ethereum in 2015. Most startups that hold an ICO, issue Ethereum-based tokens. Therefore, it was also one of the most important growth catalysts for the network in early 2017. ICOs have proven to be an extremely efficient method of funding, enabling hundreds of startups to raise enough money to start operations. The SEC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore have clarified in many instances that some of the tokens sold through crowdsales are actually securities and need to adhere to its respective regulations. Despite this, most ICOs still issue tokens that would be declared illegal by most authorities. Once this gray area is solved, Ether will likely see a lot of new money flowing in, and more investors getting involved in token sales. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) connects companies with Ethereum experts. Some notable members of the alliance are Microsoft, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and Intel. The objective of the EEA is to solve the problems of large corporations using the Ethereum Blockchain and the Ether token. Until now, most of the integrations these companies have built are working on private chains. However, private chains don���t interact directly with the Ethereum network and therefore don���t use Ether. It is fair to assume that just like there was a massive shift from Intranets to the Internet, there might also be a transition from private chains to public chains once the technology is ready. This would considerably increase the daily transactions that go through the Ethereum network. The current supply of Ether is around 93 mln coins. Vitalik Buterin has pointed out many times that the total supply will probably never surpass 100 mln if PoS is correctly integrated. If Ethereum switches successfully to PoS, there will be a significant drop in the daily issuance rate of Ether. This means that less Ether will be created every day, thus reducing the total supply of the coin. Additionally, once PoS is activated, Ether investors can opt to use their stake to verify other transactions in the network. In exchange, they will receive rewards paid out in this cryptocurrency. This will very likely attract a new wave of investors seeking cash flow producing assets. Until now, $2,000 Ether is still just fuel for our imagination. However, the technology has very solid fundamentals and many announcements to come. With the support of a growing community, everything is possible.	2
Update Jan. 26, 3:00 pm UTC: Coincheck has reported the likely inappropriate transfer of $532 mln worth of NEM to the Financial Services Agency and the Police, according to Nikkei. Update Jan. 26, 2:00 pm UTC: NEM Foundation president Lon Wong has appeared to confirm Coincheck was hacked, calling the stolen funds "the biggest theft in the history of the world." Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has suspended all withdrawals as a Ripple payment worth $123mln left its wallet Friday, Jan. 26. In what appears to be a problem tied to its support of altcoin NEM, Coincheck, which is among Japan���s largest exchanges, suddenly froze NEM deposits Friday. An accompanying blog post stated: ���Depositing NEM on Coincheck is currently being restricted. Deposits made to your account will not be reflected in your balance, and we advise all users to refrain from making deposits until the restriction has been lifted.��� The restriction then spread to NEM sales and purchases, followed by withdrawals, before the exchange subsequently stopped all currency withdrawals, both crypto and fiat. ���All withdrawals from the platform are currently restricted, including JPY. Thank you for your understanding. We are doing our utmost to resume normal operations as soon as possible,��� the most recent update to the blog post reads. Since operations began to shut down, Coincheck���s wallet has shifted a one-off sum of 101,265,057 XRP, worth approximately $123.5 mln. Unconfirmed reports to Cointelegraph additionally allege $600 mln of NEM has left the exchange. A massive XRP moved from Coincheck to somewhere!!!  Does this relate their today's NEM trade freeze?#coincheck $xrp $nem https://t.co/9xxiIzfeSz On both English and Japanese social media, Coincheck promised users it would provide full details in due course, while in the meantime apologizing for the abrupt cut to services. Notably, Coincheck is not registered with Japan���s Financial Services Agency - a regulator responsible for overseeing exchanges in the country - unlike several other prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, such as bitFlyer and Quoine. Reports have also surfaced of Japanese media starting to gather at Coinchek���s headquarters.	0
Chinese authorities are quietly stepping up a crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges to include ���market-making��� platforms and similar services, according to anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg in an article Monday, Jan. 15. As attention focuses on South Korea���s regulatory battle with cryptocurrency trading, Bloomberg reports that across the border, where official crypto-to-fiat exchanges have been banned since September, ���exchange-like services��� are now also on officials��� radar. According to anonymous sources, the government now ���plans to block domestic access to homegrown and offshore platforms that enable centralized trading��� while remaining silent on ���how policy makers define such platforms.��� The move is allegedly in response to an ���uptick��� in trading activity. Chinese investors have sought to circumvent September���s exchange ban by resorting to alternative trading environments such as peer-to-peer platforms and over-the-counter deals. Popular peer-to-peer trading site Localbitcoins saw the impact of the ban in numbers as traders piled in, generating record volumes, which in September hit as high as 115 mln yuan ($17.8 mln) per week. While the sources told Bloomberg that ���small peer-to-peer transactions aren���t being targeted,��� it remains to be seen whether the Localbitcoins phenomenon forms part of the investigation spectrum. Meanwhile, with the worst of the turbulence in Seoul apparently over, Bitcoin prices picked up in Monday���s trading, posting daily gains just over 6% according to averaged exchange data from CoinMarketCap.	0
Crypto enthusiasts living in the United States will have no trading options for a many cryptocurrencies when the major crypto exchange Binance becomes unavailable for them in September, according to a report by CryptoPotato on June 14. The report draws this conclusion based on the following table, which shows which cryptocurrencies will still available for U.S.-based traders after Binance discontinues its U.S. service:  Former Binance options in the U.S. on other crypto exchanges. Source: Goomba���s Twitter The foregoing exchanges listed are Coinbase, Bittrex, Poloniex, Kraken, HuobiUS, and eToro. The report also highlights that, in addition to the cryptocurrencies with no trading outlet in the U.S.���the all-white rows���there are also a number of tokens listed on only one exchange after Binance drops off, including ARK, BTT, IOTA, PIVX, and ZIL. These ���endangered��� exchange tokens, as well as the (temporarily) extinct tokens, will likely witness a large drop in volume, according to the report. However, veteran cryptocurrencies such as XRP, DASH, XLM, ETC, ZRX, and ZEN should survive Binance���s departure with little issue, since they are listed on four or more of the aforementioned exchanges. As recently reported by Cointelegraph, Binance updated its terms of use on June 14 to exclude trading on the platform in the U.S., which comes shortly after its announcement of a U.S.-exclusive fiat-to-crypto exchange. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) remarked on the recent changes, implying that the restructuring will be useful in the long run: ���Some short term pains may be necessary for long term gains. And we always work hard to turn every short term pain into a long term gain.���	0
The cryptocurrency market is experiencing lows across the board today, Jan. 14, with only three of the top 20 coins on CoinMarketCap in the green. The total market cap remains around $692 bln, still recovering from the Jan. 11 drop to around $630 bln. Altcoin Ripple (XRP), which had been up 18 percent as recently as Jan. 12, showed about a 10 percent loss over a 24-hour period to press time.  XRP had seen a significant rise after the altcoin had announced news of a partnership with MoneyGram on Jan. 11, but may have fallen after MoneyGram���s clarification that they are strictly using the altcoin for a pilot program: Hello, This is a pilot program being tested on internal MoneyGram International processes and is not intended for consumer use. Altcoin IOTA has experienced a similar drop in early December after clarifying that Microsoft was not officially their partner, as the altcoin���s blog had indicated, but rather a participant in their marketplace. Altcoins Cardano and Tron have both seen about 13 and 17 percent drops respectively over 24 hours, with Cardano selling for about $0.76 at press time and Tron selling for about $0.092. The largest drop today is altcoin RaiBlocks, down around 16 percent over 24 hours and in 20th on CoinMarketCap, selling for $21.19 at press time. RaiBlocks was also one of the only two coins in the red on Jan. 12 when the rest of the market was up. RaiBlocks���s fall could be attributed to recent reports of a compromised web wallet for the altcoin, which has since been taken offline.  Ethereum Classic (ETC) has seen the most growth over 24 hours, up more than 17 percent and selling for $44.32 at press time. This growth was likely caused by a Jan. 12 CNBC interview with Michael Sonnenshein, director at Bitcoin (BTC) and ETC investment fund Grayscale, speaking about the future of digital currency investment in terms of ETC. Altcoin Neo also saw a small rise, growing almost three percent over 24 hours and selling for $137.45 at press time, with Bitcoin Gold also slightly up with 0.37 percent growth over 24 hours and selling for $297.98 at press time. Bitcoin is down about seven percent over 24 hours and is trading at press time for an average of $13,474.70, higher than the Dec. 22 market low price of $12,850.	0
Both Bitcoin and gold are considered prominent stores of value and safe haven assets. However, over the past seven years, one experienced a meteoric rise in terms of market cap, user base and value, while the other failed to live up to the expectations of its investors. On May 13, StockTwits, the world���s largest financial communications platform for the investing community, revealed one of its users��� growth chart comparing various currencies, bonds and assets. In it, a StockTwits user by the name of Charlie Bilello noted that a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin made in July 2010 would have earned investors a $200 mln return. To be exact, a Bitcoin investor who purchased $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2010 would have earned $201.56 mln. In contrast, an investor who purchased $10,000 worth of gold in 2010 would have experienced a negative return of $9,981. Gold is widely regarded as a safe haven asset, which by definition means an investment that retains or increases its value amidst market turbulence and economic certainty, over time. In the past seven years, gold hasn���t met either of the two descriptions. Gold has failed to sustain its value over a seven-year period and has failed to see an increase in its value. Thus, whether gold can still be considered as a safe haven asset is quite unclear. Since July of 2010, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Euro, Silver, Gold, US Dollar, bonds, global stocks, US real estate and US stocks. Naturally, its decentralized nature, high liquidity and transportability began to appeal to a wide range of investors seeking for alternative assets to protect their wealth with a long-term investment. In many ways, Bitcoin can be perceived as Gold 2.0, or digital gold, due to its characteristics. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can sustain its value or even record an increase in its value over time because of its fixed supply of 21 mln Bitcoins. If a massive gold supply is discovered, then gold could become inflationary in terms of supply and could hinder its mid-term value. In fact, in late March, China���s largest gold mine to date was discovered by Shangdong Gold Group, a state-owned gold producer in China. At the time, Bloomberg reported: ���The Xiling mine in Shandong province told local authorities it had found 382.58 tons of gold reserves and that the volume could reach more than 550 tons once exploration is completed in two years.��� More importantly, Bitcoin���s ownership is evidently portrayed with the utilization of cryptography. Hence, Bitcoin can���t be seized by a central entity because the Bitcoin network itself is decentralized and unalterable. Furthermore, Bitcoin provides an important component which gold fails to offer and that is settlement network. Bitcoin as of current is often referred to as digital gold and settlement network. It isn���t necessarily perceived as digital cash as laid out by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto because of the lack of scaling and the network���s high transaction fees.	1
After a year long initial coin offering (ICO) that raised a record $4 bln, Block.one���s EOSIO has officially been launched. The project is highly anticipated and the June launch is as close to a moment of truth as you will get in the world of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Developers can now actively build blockchain-based applications on the platform ��� which is being aimed at businesses and large scale commercial applications. However, the launch of v1.0 could be a defining moment for the project that has promised to be able to process millions of transactions per second and eliminate user fees in its technical white paper. EOS is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system that was introduced to the world in 2017. Its developers, Block.one, headed up by CEO Brendan Blumer and chief technical officer Dan Larimer, unveiled EOS at Consensus 2017. 12 months later, the project raised a record-breaking $4 bln. The EOS operating system promises to allow developers to build decentralized applications - similar to Ethereum - that can be commercially scalable. The software includes ���accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling of applications across many CPU cores or clusters,��� according to the white paper. The EOS token sale started in June 2017 as an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token - but as of June 2, 2018, EOS token holders that had registered for the mandatory token swap would see those ERC-20 tokens converted to EOS tokens on the EOSIO platform. Holders of these native EOS tokens will be responsible for the management of the ecosystem, by voting for block producers that mine blocks and maintain the network. Meanwhile users of EOS-based decentralized applications will have access to a certain amount of resources directly proportional to the amount of EOS tokens staked in an application. EOSIO is maintained by a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) system, originally created by Larimer and still used by Steemit - the blogging platform he created in 2016. Larimer explains the finer details of DPoS in what he dubbed ���his missing whitepaper��� on the platform. In layman's terms, a DPoS system looks to answer some shortcomings of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake consensus mechanisms. The EOS DPoS system allows users to vote for block producers - who are rewarded tokens for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain. These block producers are constantly evaluated by the community and will be ���fired��� if they underperform - i.e. fail to validate transactions and create blocks. According to the Ledger Intel Dossier on EOS, Steemit���s DPoS currently handles thousands of transactions per second - which does bode well for EOSIO. This is why the launch of the EOSIO is a moment of truth - the cryptocurrency community finally has a chance to use a platform where it can handle potentially millions of transactions per second. Now that the ICO is over, and EOSIO has been launched, there are a number of things to consider in the coming weeks and months. First and foremost, users that participated in the EOS Ethereum-based token sale need to participate in a token swap. The conversion of their ERC-20 based tokens to EOS.IO tokens required users to register before June 2. If they failed to do that, their ERC-20 EOS tokens would not be attributed to the EOS main net. This essentially means that any users that did not register for the token swap will see their ERC-20 EOS tokens become non-transferable - rendering them useless.   Furthermore, the token swap is considered to be a critical component of the EOS ecosystem. Community participation is crucial for the DPoS system to work and ensure the voting of block creators and their constant evaluation. Like many blockchain projects, the promises of a white paper paint a pretty picture, but the finished product is what matters. The year long ICO provided a massive amount of funding for the project and a number of beta versions of the EOSIO have been released during that time, under the project name ���Dawn���. The latest beta, v4.0, was released in May 2018. According to EOS��� Github page, there are 620 issues still open on the project, while over 1400 have been resolved during the development phase. Nevertheless EOSIO v1.0 is officially out and there is sure to be plenty of feedback once more developers start using the platform. With that being said, a number of projects are already being worked on. According to EOSindex, which tracks that number of blockchain decentralized applications based on EOS, there are over 140 projects being actively developed. One of the most well-known is Everipedia -  an online encyclopedia based on the EOS blockchain that will reward content creators with native tokens. The Everipedia project attracted the co-founder of Wikipedia, Larry Sanger, back in 2017, who joined the team as its chief information officer. Sanger made the move to combat the control and  centralization of information, which he believes Wikipedia has now become: "The biggest problem with online information today is that it is centralized and controlled by a very few players, that it benefits to have the most salacious and hype-ridden information. We can do much better." It must be mentioned that Everipedia is planning an airdrop of its token to any holders of EOS, as reported by Fortune. While the project itself raised more than $4 bln during its year long token sale, Block.one have also managed to secure $50 mln of funding from blockchain investment firm SVK Crypto. The London based investment firm will invest in companies building decentralized applications on EOSIO - with a particular focus on social media, data ownership, tech platforms and logistics. Block.one���s EOC VC is a funding program that looks to provide developers and businesses with funding for projects using the EOSIO. The program has pledged to raise over $1 bln for funding EOSIO projects in future. This includes the $325 mln EOSIO Ecosystem Fund with Mike Novogratz���s Galaxy Digital LP. EOSIO will be keenly watched in the coming months as it provides a fresh blockchain platform for the development of DApps - which is in direct competition to Ethereum. If the EOS token swap goes according to plan, the EOSIO ecosystem should begin to function as planned. This could well signal the arrival of next big smart contract DApp platform. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and EOS CTO Dan Larimer have had some philosophical debates on both Steemit and Reddit about the pros and cons of Proof-of-Stake vs Delegated Proof-of-Stake. In a reddit thread, Buterin explained his misgivings of Larimer���s DPoS protocol, highlighting concerns of voter participation and the mechanics of fee-less system. Buterin believes low voter participation, exchange voting on coin holders behalf and a discrepancy between coin holders and users interests could be major stumbling blocks: ���To try to ensure decentralization, DPOS allows all coin holders to vote on who the nodes running the consortium chain are. This, together with the lack of in-protocol economic incentives for these master nodes to behave correctly, and the lack of client-side validation capability, mean that there is an extreme reliance on the voting mechanism.��� Furthermore, Buterin believes the voting system is open to manipulation: ���There is also one other substantial concern with voting: in order to win votes, any delegate would need to have a visible public identity; anonymous delegating would be very difficult to sustain in the long term. This makes the entire system substantially more vulnerable to political attacks.��� Larimer hit back on Steemit, countering Buterin���s claims while providing what he describes as points that debunk Ethereum���s proposed Proof-of-Stake algorithm, Casper. Larimer believes that the Casper PoS ���encourages collusion and cooperation rather than competition���. The EOS CTO also addressed Buterin���s critique of low voter participation and the potential for collusion of voters for an attacker to acquire stake. ���Low voter participation has been addressed over the past 3 years through a combination of voting proxies, easier user interfaces, and a reduction on the number of things people have to vote for. ���Furthermore, non-voters do not make things less secure. They keep tokens off the market which still makes it more expensive for an attacker to acquire stake. Large stakeholders have a huge incentive to vote to protect their wealth and an attacker would have to acquire more stake than the largest whales in the system.��� Larimer also stands by EOS��� fee-less system, which requires DApps to cover network costs: ���Lastly EOS is designed around the idea that service providers (DApp Developers) should cover network costs, not the users. A good application needs a monetization strategy that is fully independent of network operation. ���The existence of Steem is all the proof we need to demonstrate the value of "free" transactions and how we solve the issues with users needing stake.��� While their back-and-forth, academic style feud has been interesting, it does show the stark differences between the technology underpinning the two contrasting platforms. Nevertheless, with an enormous amount of capital raised, Block.one should be able to ensure the continual improvement of EOSIO in the coming years. Whether or not it becomes a rival to Ethereum remains to be seen. As was the case with Ethereum, the development of popular decentralized applications will no doubt prove the usefulness of EOSIO and drive its adoption in the future. First things first - a successful token swap is required to ensure that EOS tokens are registered on the EOSIO so that voters can actively participate in selecting block producers that will validate transactions and maintain the ecosystem.	2
Bitcoin markets are reacting to fresh regulatory comments on crypto from India���s finance minister Arun Jaitley, made during his most recent budget speech in the Parliament today, Feb.1. After Jaitley noted in his speech that cryptocurrency is not legal tender in the country and promised a crackdown on ���illegitimate activities��� involving crypto, a flood of misinterpreted comments warning of an outright ban appeared across the mainstream press and social media. Markets in turn fell in trading on Thursday, Bitcoin dipping below $9,512 after breaking $10,300 Wednesday, Jan. 31, data from Bitstamp shows. India has been sporadic in its attempts to formalize cryptocurrency regulation over the past two years. Since the country���s currency reforms, interest in Bitcoin especially has skyrocketed, with local exchanges reporting huge growth. At the same time, India���s central bank has issued repeated warnings on cryptocurrency investment, some of which appeared tantamount to calling it illegal. During his budget speech today, Jaitley stated: ���The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.��� While Jaitley���s speech noticeably avoided any mention of legality of crypto in and of itself, commentaries by third parties and mainstream media journalists controversially claimed that a ban was imminent. ���Arun Jaitley has just killed India���s cryptocurrency party,��� Quartz���s article on the subject proclaims, citing a lawyer who expects ���a legislative mechanism or... suitable amendment in existing legislation to ensure that dealing and trading in cryptocurrency is made illegal and to penalise entities and individuals who are involved in their trade and circulation.��� On Twitter, the curious reading of Jaitley���s words continued, with declarations of Bitcoin being ���illegal��� and soon to be ���eliminated.��� Cryptocurrencies are illegal. Since they can't be traced.   Does this apply to currencies like:  - Bitcoin.  - Old Rs. 500 note.  - Electoral Bonds?#Budget2018 Bitcoin to be banned. Crypto currency illegal in India says @arunjaitley #Bitcoin #DigitalCurrency #budget2018 From within the industry, however, sources told an altogether different story. Crypto exchange Unocoin summarized that there had been ���no change��� in government perspective since the budget speech. ���It is business-as-usual,��� it added in its most recent twitter activity. Based on the #UnionBudget2018 announcement, there is no change in government's stance with respect to #cryptocurrency. It is business-as-usual at @Unocoin #Budget2018 pic.twitter.com/YGUFOlfhCj Cointelegraph correspondant Joseph Young also posted on his personal Twitter about the FUD in mainstream media surrounding the finance minister���s comments: In what universe does this look like a ban? Indian finance minister said it will eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in "criminal use cases."   Mainstream media took it as "it will eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies" and forgot the rest. pic.twitter.com/IXRwHSqZTo In line with previous government initiatives, Jaitley similarly produced no surprises with his commitment to expanding the use of Blockchain technology at the state level going forward. ���The government will explore use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,��� he said in his speech.	0
The New York Stock Exchange has filed for permission to launch a number of Bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds (ETF) just one week into 2018. As reported by BusinessInsider, a filing sent to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the exchange intends to launch five different ETFs offering ���bull and bear��� futures contracts on the Arca stock exchange. These EFTs will be linked to the price of Bitcoin futures listed on the CME and CBOE exchanges, which launched Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017: ���The target benchmark���s value will be calculated as the last sale price published by the CME or the CBOE or any other US exchange that subsequently trades bitcoin futures contracts on or before 11 a.m. E.T.��� The three ���Bull Funds��� are categorized as 1.25X, 1.5X and 2X, offering 100 percent, 150 percent and 200 percent returns on the given contract. As stated in the document sent to the SEC, the funds are not intended to be traded any longer than a day - and offer percentage returns based on the given contract entered into: ���According to the Registration Statement, the 1.25X Bull Fund, 1.5X Bull Fund and 2X Bull Fund seeks daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate positively to either 125 percent, 150 percent or 200 percent the daily return of the target benchmark.��� However, investors stand to a chance of facing the same multipliers in loses, should the market move against their contracts: ���Conversely, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately 1.25 times, 1.5 times or 2 times, as applicable, as much on a percentage basis as the level of the target benchmark when the benchmark declines.��� As the name suggests, the ���Bears Funds��� allow investors the chance to leverage against a decline in the value of Bitcoin. The two funds offered are 1X and 2X, offering 100 percent and 200 percent gains should the contract meet its target on the given day of trading. Once again, should the benchmark rise in value, Bear Fund investors stand to suffer loses compounded by the multiplier (1X or 2X) they���ve agreed to, as per the description of the 2X Bear Fund: ���If the 2X Bear Fund is successful in meeting its investment objective, its value on a given day should gain approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as the level of the target benchmark when the target benchmark declines. Conversely, its value on a given day should lose approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as the level of the target benchmark when the target benchmark rises.���  Should the NYSE be permitted to launch these ETFs, they will be the third American exchange to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. CME and CBOE have been trading futures since December. Wasting no time in sending their application to the SEC, this move shows that there is plenty of interest in Bitcoin by Wall Street money. While the likes of Merrill Lynch have denied its financial advisors from offering clients Bitcoin-related investments, exchanges are looking to set up of various offerings. Once a number of ETFs and trading options have been available for a while, there will be more information on how well these options are trading. Given that knowledge, could we see a change in sentiment by financial institutions whose clients are looking to enter the cryptocurrency market?	2
United States-based film producer Ryan Kavanaugh���s Proxima Media has unveiled a $100 million investment for a cryptocurrency-based film funding tool, entertainment industry news outlet TheWrap reported on May 23. Per the report, Proxima Media ��� which Kavanaugh founded and owns ��� announced plans for a new crypto-enabled financing tool for film, TV, music and other intellectual property-driven content dubbed Proxicoin. Proxima reportedly received the investment from garment production company Central Wealth Group and venture capital fund Step Ventures. Proxicoin reportedly plans to issue Ethereum-based security tokens that allow holders to invest in movies and TV shows. The company said that the token has already been built and audited, and that a deal with Malaysia-based Fusang Exchange has been set to launch it. Vincent Tse, CEO of Hong Kong-based Step Ventures commented on the development: ���Proxicoin makes a highly sought-after financial product available to many individual and smaller investors.��� Tse also noted that films are an asset class traditionally uncorrelated to capital markets and are sought-after among large hedge funds and banks. Furthermore, TheWrap claims that Proxicoin holders will also be partial owners of a new exchange for financing entertainment projects called Entertainment Stock X (ESX). According to TheWrap, deals for listing over 30 movies are already in place. Kavanaugh commented on the initiative: ���This exchange will give ordinary consumers worldwide access to investments in their favorite movies, something they love, in a way that was previously only available to a limited few.��� Kavanaugh is also an executive at Warner Brothers, and has produced several films, including ���The Social Network,��� western ���3:10 to Yuma,��� and ���Mamma Mia!.��� As Cointelegraph reported in October last year, U.S. actor and producer Johnny Depp is partnered with crypto-powered social entertainment platform TaTaTu. In November 2018, Dutch rights management company Fintage House has signed a deal with blockchain-based social entertainment platform TaTaTu to start accepting cryptocurrency for rights transactions.	2
The popular encrypted messaging app Telegram will launch its own Blockchain platform and cryptocurrency, according to sources familiar with the matter. The new platform will be dubbed either ���The Open Network��� or ���Telegram Open Network��� (TON) and is supposed to be based on an improved version of Blockchain technology. Initial reports of the new platform surfaced today from Anton Rozenberg, a former employee of Telegram���s publishing division Telegraph. Rozenberg posted on Facebook what he claims is an advertorial video for the new platform (he did not disclose the source of the video). He also pointed out that TON would aid those under oppressive governments, since they would be able to transfer money natively through the messaging app. This could serve to break the state���s control over citizens��� money, added Rozenberg.       Cointelegraph learned that the currency of TON will be called ���Gram��� and the platform will be natively integrated with many of the most popular messaging apps (it���s not yet certain which ones). The platform will utilize light wallets, making it unnecessary for users to download a large and unwieldy Blockchain. The TON platform also won���t have to go through a multi-year bootstrap period like most new platforms, since the Telegram app already boasts 180 mln users, according to Bloomberg. Telegram is already immensely popular with the Blockchain community, as cofounder Pavel Durov proclaimed: ���Like right now, the entire Blockchain and cryptocurrency community just switched to Telegram.��� Cointelegraph has reached out to Durov, but has not yet received a reply. While still not officially confirmed, the creation of TON is compatible with an earlier article from Bloomberg, which said: ���[Durov] sees Telegram as a charity that he���ll start to monetize early next year, but only enough to fund expansion.��� The enigmatic Pavel Durov teamed up with his brother to launch Telegram in 2013. The app boasts end-to-end encryption, making it extremely useful for dissidents and ordinary citizens living under oppressive regimes. In fact, according to Bloomberg, Telegram accounts for 40% of Iran���s internet traffic. The Iranian government is so aggrieved by the app���s privacy features that they have charged Durov, in absentia, of terrorism. Durov isn���t terribly bothered; he���s used to standing up to national governments. He and his brother cofounded Russia���s largest social network, VK, building a company worth over $3 bln. VK was in fact quite similar to Facebook, but whereas Zuckerberg was able to maintain control (and a massive ownership stake), Durov was not.  When he refused to hand over personal user information to Russian authorities, he was forced to sell his stake in the company to one of Putin���s allies. Thus, while Zuckerberg had the option of an IPO, Durov is using an ICO to monetize his creation. After being forced out of VK, Durov left Russia for good, taking with him an estimated $300 mln and 2,000 Bitcoins. He took his substantial wealth with him to St. Kitts and Nevis, investing enough in the Caribbean nation to become a citizen. However, he spends most of his time in Dubai. Durov insists Telegram is not for sale at any price, because his users��� privacy is too valuable to risk: ���Even for $20 billion, it���s not for sale. That���s a lifetime guarantee.���	2
Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has launched a surprise cryptocurrency mining platform, unconfirmed sources surfacing today claim. CnLedger, a Twitter-based local crypto news information provider, relayed the report from Chinese Internet service qq.com, stating Alibaba���s ���P2P Nodes��� platform had ���launched��� after a registration in October 2017. According to the available material from cnLedger, Alibaba ���may incorporate��� P2P Nodes in its e-commerce platform ���in future���: Tencent News: Alibaba launching virtual currency mining platform "P2P Nodes", registered in Nanjing. May incorporate with e-commerce platform in future. (Unconfirmed)https://t.co/w0ZzgKk773 In a further development, fellow Chinese conglomerate Tencent has registered a ���Blockchain-related trademark��� for an entity referred to variously as ���Ether Lock��� and ���Ethernet Lock.��� Chinese internet giant Tencent was found to have registered blockchain-related trademark "Ether Lock" https://t.co/fQKn0rHnMq The moves run contrary to the current regulatory narrative coming from Beijing. Authorities have recently made known a desire to slowly reduce participation in Bitcoin mining, while regulators are also moving to eradicate the last traces of centralized crypto-to-fiat trading. P2P Nodes also represents an apparent U-turn for Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who in December declared that the world was ���not ready��� for engagement with cryptocurrency. In an interview with CNBC around the same time, Ma revealed that Alibaba had ���spent a lot of efforts��� researching Blockchain technology, but that Bitcoin is ���not for [him]���. Cryptocurrency markets continue to feel the pressure in part from China���s latest regulatory moves, with Bitcoin losing almost 15% and altcoins much more in the past 24 hours��� trading.	1
Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially stated that Russia will issue its own ���CryptoRuble��� at a closed door meeting in Moscow, according to local news sources. The news broke through Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov. According to the official, the state issued cryptocurrency cannot be mined and will be issued and controlled and maintained only by the authorities. The CryptoRubles can be exchanged for regular Rubles at any time, though if the holder is unable to explain where the CryptoRubles came from, a 13 percent tax will be levied. The same tax will be applied to any earned difference between the price of the purchase of the token and the price of the sale. Nikiforov said: ���I confidently declare that we run CryptoRuble for one simple reason: if we do not, then after 2 months our neighbors in the EurAsEC will.��� While the announcement means that Russia will enter the cryptocurrency world, it is in no way an affirmation or legalization of Bitcoin or any other decentralized cryptocurrency. On the contrary, Putin quite recently called for a complete ban on all cryptocurrencies within Russia. The statement from Putin seemed apparently to contradict the earlier comments from other ministers who seemed pro-crypto, but only with regulations, as well as Putin���s recent meetings with Buterin and others. Now, with the issuance of the CryptoRuble, the apparent contradiction has been made clear.	0
Fundstrat���s Tom Lee has forecasted that Bitcoin���s price will reach $91,000 by March 2020, basing his prediction on a chart that shows Bitcoin���s (BTC) performances after past market dips, Forbes reported March 17. Lee and Fundstrat used an average of the percentage gained in price after each dip to arrive at the 2020 figure.  The Forbes piece notes that because the chart is based on a logarithmic scale as opposed to the traditional linear-based graph, BTC���s highs and lows are not as distinct. Lee has been predicting high prices for BTC since its price was below $3,000. In July 2017 Lee had already stated that Bitcoin would hit $55,000 by 2022. More recently, in January of this year, Lee said that BTC would hit $25,000 by the end of 2018. Lee and Fundstrat also recently released the ���Bitcoin Misery Index��� in early March, which is described as a ���contrarian index��� that lets investors know how ���miserable��� BTC holders are at the current price.	2
In a vindication of cryptocurrency exchanges which have had their share of growing pains this year, CBOE launched Bitcoin futures trading at 5 PM Central time and their website went down within minutes. CBOE has confirmed that the slowness (and 404 errors) users are receiving are due to much higher than normal traffic:    Due to heavy traffic on our website, visitors to https://t.co/jb3O722hoo may find that it is performing slower than usual and may at times be temporarily unavailable. All trading systems are operating normally.   Since the beginning of the year, digital currency adoption and price appreciation have been off the charts, causing virtually all major exchanges to face their share of slowdowns and crashes. Many had speculated that once Wall Street got involved, with robust servers capable (and used to) handling enormous amounts of traffic, they would blow away traditional Bitcoin exchanges. Apparently, even mainstream Wall Street firms are going to have difficult dealing with Bitcoin���s demand. Facing the opening of futures today, Bitcoin���s price has been ever volatile. Within minutes of the futures markets opening, the price soared by over $1,000 only to immediately fall by half that. At press time, the price is back on the climb. This is fascinating to watch.  Bitcoin jumps $1200 in 7 minutes and then falls $500 in 1. All the while, the CBOE has yet to get through the imbalances and open the contract for trading.  At this rate, BTC will hit one of the circuit breakers before the CBOE can even get rolling! pic.twitter.com/AAzzE3MshN It���s hard to say how accurate ���sentiment��� is, but many on the /r/BitcoinMarkets subreddit were staying in fiat until the launch of the futures markets. In recent weeks, there has been a great deal of fear that the opening of regulated futures trading could make it easier for institutional investors to short the currency, driving the price down. Judging by the price action right now, those fears seem to have mostly abated, but traders remain jittery.	2
This morning Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a peak of $16,930 and the total cryptocurrency market cap hit a high of 603 bln, after a steady past couple of days of growth. The market recovery comes in the wake of a major dip at the end of last week that was followed by several days of volatility. Just last Friday Dec. 22, in the midst of pre-holiday bustle, the cryptocurrency market was awash in red. Altcoins lost up to 40 percent, and Bitcoin was close behind, suffering a 30 percent drop and reaching as low as $11,833 a coin. In a single day, the total cryptocurrency market cap decreased by more than $200 bln. Just days before on Dec. 17, Bitcoin reached a record high of $20,078 and leading up to the crash Bitcoin price had been hovering between $16-17,000. What followed was several days of volatility. Just 24 hours after the frightening dip, the market saw a notable bounce back. The recovery, however, was not stable and was quickly followed by another dip leading into Christmas day.   Since then, however, Bitcoin has been gaining steadily and has fully recovered its pre-dip heights, trading at an average of just over $16,000 at press time.  Total market cap, which also spiked and then dipped again over the weekend, has been steadily growing since Monday. At press time total market cap also showed an almost full recovery, at $603 bln.  Many Bitcoin investors saw Friday���s dip as the perfect chance to buy up more of the leading cryptocurrency at a ���discounted��� price. Others pointed out that the overall market correction around the New Year is nothing new, and noted that corrections like the one on Friday are actually just what the market needs.	2
2017 is a great year for cryptocurrency development - so many exciting projects appear that it���s difficult to keep track of them all. Recently, we wrote about some altcoin contenders. Now, let���s take a closer look at the five most promising newcomers whose positions are growing fast. One of the first cryptocurrencies to appear this year was Wings. From January to June its popularity jumped up and down and has recently stabilized at a market capitalization of $56 mln. Based in Switzerland, Wings provides the necessary tools for the creation and promotion of decentralized projects. They use smart contracts and forecast markets to evaluate projects. Next up is the well-known Gnosis. They started in February and soon reached high levels of demand, but have backtracked a bit since May. The coin has now settled at a market cap of around $295 mln. Its ���crowdsourced wisdom��� platform enables anyone to speculate on any future events and get rewards for accurate predictions. Gnosis also provides its own platform for the creation of DApps. In the middle of the chart, we have Zcash with a $378 mln market cap. The cryptocurrency first showed up in October 2016, but its popularity has never been quite high until March 2017. Zcash is the first open and permissionless financial system operating under zero-knowledge cryptography. It uses a special zk-SNARK proof which allows the network to support a secure ledger of balances without revealing any parties. Zcash encrypts the payment information and uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity. According to the developers, that approach allows all involved parties to send completely anonymous transactions. The second spot goes to another March-born cryptocurrency Golem, which has reached a $400 mln market cap. On March 20 it became the 13th most valuable digital currency and its popularity has leveled in April. Golem���s crowdfunding event became the second fastest in crypto history - $8,600,000 in 29 minutes. Golem plans to become a huge global network, extremely powerful and 100 percent open sourced. It can also help with computationally intensive cryptography work. And finally, our gold medal goes to Stratis. This cryptocurrency became one of April���s top contenders immediately after hitting the markets. In the last week of May, its market cap jumped up to $1.070 bln. Stratis is currently one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. This powerful Blockchain development platform has a unique feature - it offers the ability to code native decentralized apps in C#. It opens up a number of possibilities for developers. Moreover, Stratis allows organizations to create private Blockchains. They are realized in the form of sidechains, which are fully integrated with Stratis��� main Blockchain. This short list offers a brief look into the current state of the cryptocurrency market. But the popularity of different cryptocurrencies is not a constant, and these ratings might change very soon. With the rest of the year still ahead of us, there is a lot of projects to look forward to. Let us know in the comments which cryptocurrencies you are cheering for!	1
The International Economic Forum, which just wrapped up in St. Petersburg, reportedly resulted in more than ���30 bln of investments. The final and the most important result, however, is measured not in numbers, but in the mood and attitude of those who attended the Forum and who was keeping an eye on the events and meetings held in the North ���capital��� of Russia. The cryptocurrency community is for sure left stunned by the recent meeting between Russian President Putin and the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin. As commented by Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov, during the meeting, Putin and Buterin discussed the application of technologies in the country. Reportedly, the president supported the idea of establishing new business relationships following the road paved by Blockchain technology. Earlier during the Forum, the first Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said that Putin is really enthusiastic about the idea of building a new digital economy in the country and shared that at the moment at least three directions of Blockchain application are being explored and tested, which include the tracking of goods, building identity as well as ownership rights protection systems. Buterin was among the speakers at the panel discussion on Blockchain economy, which actually became one of the most popular ones. Panelists discussed the potential of the technology to trigger the establishment of a new type of economy, as well as regulatory issues related to that process. Russian regulators have been struggling so far trying to find a way to put Blockchain applications inside existing regulatory framework. Pseudo-anonymity is what concerns them the most. Buterin says: ���I think this dilemma has no resolution. Regulators will always try to come up with new ways to control and analyze transactions, and people will always try to think how to hide these transactions. It is a sort of mathematical war, but system���s properties will never let any of these sides win.��� When Buterin first came up with the idea of Ethereum, he had only a few applications in his mind, as he said himself. However, as the technology matured and network grew, he was amazed to see how many applications for Ethereum Blockchain were found and suggested by numerous community members. He says: ���The creativity and innovation brought about by the community are way more important than what I once came up with.��� Answering the question of one of the co-panelists, Buterin mentioned that we are right at the doorstep entering the period when Blockchain technology is marching confidently across the industries. People start realizing that it is not just a toy for a bunch of hackers, but an efficient tool which has the potential to be deployed by banks, financial institutions, businesses, regulators, etc. He shared his own experience in the Blockchain space and what inspires him the most: ���I started in the Blockchain space six years ago. I earned 20 BTC, 8.5 of them I invested into buying a shirt. Bitcoins I spent are now worth $20,000 and the shirt is long gone. But what I realized joining this global experiment is that this digital economy system only works if thousands of people around the world work together. And the idea that a few thousands of people connected to the network can create an independent financial system impressed me a lot. Ideas of decentralization, cryptography, openness, transparency stunned me. However, the application of Blockchain is not limited to cryptocurrency only. It has a huge potential to be applied across industries, in businesses and organizations of all sizes bringing significant benefits.��� Blockchain technology is often compared with another technological invention - the Internet - and the impact of it is expected to be much greater. Just like in the case of the World Wide Web, those countries that decide to be bold and implement technology solutions before anyone else does are going to have a significant competitive advantage. Russia has a chance to become one of the leaders in the global IT industry. Even though details of the meeting between Putin and Buterin are kept under the seal of secrecy, one detail leaked - the president is ready to give full support for the development of Blockchain technology, what would definitely result in a much greater volume of investments coming into the country despite any restrictions and sanctions. This idea is actively supported and promoted by Sergey Gorkov, chairman at VEB (Vnesheconombank), who suggests empowering banks for navigating relationships between investors preparing for ICOs.	2
Market analyst Elliott Prechter has projected that digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, will experience a sharp decline in the near future. Prechter has correctly forecast the surge of Bitcoin in 2010 when the cryptocurrency���s price was just six cents. In his July 13, 2017 report, Prechter claimed that the Elliott wave pattern, optimistic psychology, and Blockchain bottlenecks will lead to the collapse of the digital currency market. "The price activity and manic sentiment that led to present prices have dwarfed even the Tulip mania of nearly 400 years ago. The success of Bitcoin has spawned 800-plus clones (altcoins) and counting, most of which are high-tech, pump-and-dump schemes. Nevertheless, investors have eagerly bid them up.��� Prechter is the son of analyst Robert Prechter, who founded the newsletter The Elliott Wave Theorist in 1979. Prechter correctly predicted the 1987 stock market crash using the Elliott Wave Principle. However, the accuracy of the Elliott Wave was put in question when Prechter���s forecast on the end of the 1990s bull market missed. The younger Prechter, meanwhile, has correctly predicted Bitcoin���s rise when it was just priced at six cents in September 2010. The surge in the price of Bitcoin in the past couple of weeks has caught the attention of several financial analysts. According to Ronnie Moas of Standpoint Research, the cryptocurrency could possibly hit $5,000 in the next few months. Ritholtz Wealth Management chief executive officer (CEO) Josh Brown, meanwhile, blogged that he used Coinbase to purchase some Bitcoin. The banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley analyzed Bitcoin and its Blockchain technology in their latest reports. Elliott Prechter, however, said that the excitement about Bitcoin surpasses the tulip bulb mania in The Netherlands in the early 1600s. ���A mania can be both a mania and a revolution at the same time."	0
Bill Shihara, CEO of Bittrex, confirmed during a Unikrn Radio podcast with Unikrn CEO Rahul Sood on Jan. 31 that the Bittrex exchange will be opening up USD trading to the majority of its customers. Bittrex was founded in 2013 by Shihara and two business partners, all of whom previously worked for security at Microsoft. Shihara told Sood that Bittrex���s initial success was due to a combination of the founders��� security background, as well as their willingness to put their resumes with photos of themselves online at a time when most exchanges were anonymous. Bittrex made the news in October 2017 for its sudden decision to disable thousands of accounts for compliance reviews without warning its users in advance. Perhaps due to this customer service hiccup, the exchange announced in December 2017 that it had temporarily stopped taking on new users, citing the backlog of user support tickets and their current inability to accurately verify each new user with such high demand. In the podcast, Shihara noted that since Bittrex is a US-based exchange, they take their KYC and AML legal obligations very seriously, which requires a large number of staff to do verifications. In response to a question about the challenges of customer support service, Shihara said that they are hoping to add another 20 support contractors this spring, bringing the total up to 80. Shihara also added that user signups for the exchange would open again soon, but there will be additional requirements for new users, like minimum trade deposits. According to Shihara, this ensures that the new users are ���people that understand what they are doing.��� Bittrex is not designed for the retail customer, but is aimed at a target audience of more sophisticated or institutional traders, Shihara told Sood, ���I don���t think that Bittrex will ever be a retail shop. I���m not looking to be the Fidelity for crypto.��� As for future plans for Bittrex, Shihara mentioned the partnership with South Korean-based exchange Upbit, which gives Upbit access to their liquidity and Bittrex access to a retail shop. He said there are many more such partnerships ���in the pipeline��� in the coming months. Shihara has meetings set up with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to talk about the possibility of trading in securities in the future as well, for he sees the potential for a Bittrex subsidiary or parallel business for securities trading. He thinks that regulation is inevitable: ���If we want Bitcoin to be ubiquitous and traded around the world, we need governments and institutions adopting it.��� Shihara first became involved in crypto in 2011, when he began mining for Bitcoin (BTC) with spare computer parts in a garage. However, he grew discouraged when the price fell from $60 to $6, and even threw away his laptop with his BTC on it. In comparison, Bitcoin is now trading at around $8002.76, down around 11 percent over a 24-hour period by press time.	0
Bitcoin���s (BTC) price fell by $1,400 within minutes after a crash of United States-based cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase. Coinbase first reported that it was investigating an issue in which its API and website were not functioning properly at 1:47 p.m. PDT on its status website.  According to the daily chart of bitcoin price on Coin360, bitcoin���s price and market cap began to plummet around 1:25 p.m. PST, just minutes before Coinbase���s first announcement.  Bitcoin 24-hour price chart. Source: Coin360 By 2:13 p.m. Coinbase reported that it had identified the problem and was implementing the fix. By 2:38 p.m. the problem was reported to be resolved. A Cointelegraph correspondent with a Coinbase account checked to confirm the site was operational.  Today���s crash follows a degraded performance report on June 25 and another crash incident on June 24, both of which were resolved within an hour of reporting. The crash comes on the heels of today���s rally in which bitcoin surpassed both the $12,000 and $13,000 price marks in a matter of hours. At press time, bitcoin seems to be recovering slightly from the dip, up 0.71% in the past hour and still up 9.48% on the day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin is currently trading at $12,690.	0
2017 was definitely the year of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has surged from more than $950 at the beginning of the year to as high as $20,000. The total market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies hit the $600 bln mark in December. We also saw an enormous growth in the number of the Initial Coin Offerings - from one or two a week in 2016, to dozens of ICOs in seven days in 2017. Cointelegraph is launching the ���New Year���s Special��� series of articles to highlight the results of this year and to get ready for the upcoming 2018. In this article, let���s have a look at companies that have performed better than others during this remarkable year for the industry. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that works with smart contracts. Smart contracts allow making agreements that are executed automatically without any human interaction. Vitalik Buterin, the winner of 2014 World Technology Award, and Jeffrey Wilcke, the former Vice President of Amazon, launched the project July 30, 2015. In 2017, every three out of four projects were performed on the Ethereum platform, making it the most popular platform for ICO over the year.  Around 13 mln people use its services. Its token, ETH, is currently the third among all the currencies after Bitcoin and Ripple in market cap. Vitalik Buterin Jeffrey Wilcke Vitalik Buterin was also listed among Bloomberg���s Top 50 Most Influential People this year. IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger specialized in the Internet of Things. This system has no transaction fees, low confirmation time and is stable regardless the number of transactions since its technology is based on an innovative consensus model ���Tangle.��� This model does not have blocks, chains and miners. If you want to make a transaction, you have to approve two previous transactions pointed by the system. These actions prove that all nodes have the same current state. The project was launched in July 2016 by David S��nsteb��, a serial entrepreneur and Dominik Schiener. In November 2017, IOTA partnered with PwC, Microsoft, Deutsche Telekom and others for data monetization program. The company also received significant investments from the Bosch Group this year.  David S��nsteb��  Dominik Schiener Up to November 2017, IOTA platform���s had over 65,000 users. Coinbase is one of the top digital currency wallet and platform for exchange. A simple announcement that Coinbase is going to launch support for Bitcoin Cash significantly affected the BCH price. The platform is one of the three Blockchain projects that got BitLicense, the business license issued by New York State Department of Financial Services. In 2016, it was transformed to GDAX, the Global Digital Asset Exchange. The exchange is the first Bitcoin exchange licensed in the US which proves its actions are reliable due to the close supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Brian Armstrong, who worked with Airbnb, Deloitte and IBM and Fred Ehrsam, the former trader at Goldman Sachs, launched the company in July 2011. Brian Armstrong Fred Ehrsam The Global Digital Asset Exchange has over 13,300,000 users. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement and currency exchange. Its main goal is to make an entire system devoted to money transferring. Launched in 2012, the company is working on ensuring real-time transactions between the banks. Currently, the company is working with over 75 banks all over the world. These banks are implementing and testing the technology in their internal payment systems. In December 2017, Ripple announced that Japanese and South Korean banks had started testing Blockchain to make international payments between the banks cheaper. The company was organized in October 2012, by Brad Garlinghouse, the former Senior Vice President at Yahoo!, and Stefan Thomas, the founder and co-founder of six other companies. Brad Garlinghouse  Stefan Thomas Brave is a web browser that blocks advertisements and trackers. As a result, websites work faster and traffic decreases significantly. So you save your time and money. In addition, you cannot catch any malware in the ad clicking on it accidentally. Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript programming language and co-founder of Mozilla, and Brian R. Bondy, a winner of Microsoft MVP Award for Visual C++ in 2010-2011, launched Brave in May 2017.  Brendan Eich  Brian R. Bondy At a rough estimate, Brave has about two to three mln users. Brave is also one of the fastest ICO. The team raised $35 mln in 27 seconds. Qtum is the first UTXO-based smart contract system with a proof-of-stake consensus model. The platform use Account Attraction Layer to combine Bitcoin Core and Ethereum Virtual Machine. Proof-of-stake model reduces the computational difficulty in the network and increases scaling possibilities. On Dec. 28, 2017, Qtum and Baofeng, the largest video hosting in China, announced the partnership to transform the music and movie industry work. Patrick Dai, Neil Mahi, the former Chief Blockchain Architect at BitSE, and Jordan Earls launched Qtum in March 2017.  Patrick Dai  Jordan Earls In 2017, Forbes China included Patrick Dai in the ���30 Under 30 China��� list for his achievements. Launched in June 2017 by Jun Hasewaga and Donnie Harinsut, OmiseGO is the decentralized financial technology for exchange and payment services.

In an interview on CNBC, Coinbase president Asiff Hirji provided some veiled clues as to what is coming for the cryptocurrency exchange in the future. He also gave insights about recent happenings. Hirji did not reveal much in the way of specifics, but did comment on a number of matters, including what type of investors are opening new accounts, how other cryptocurrencies will be added to the exchange and whether the company will go public. First, the president indicated that trade volume was up thirty times year-over-year and that the exchange is adding new accounts under management at the rate of tens of thousands per day. When asked about what type of account holders these were, he said: ���These are the same kind of people that you would imagine would have accounts at brokerages and want to invest in cryptocurrency���As the asset class has matured, I think there are a lot of people who are adding it just like any other asset class to their portfolio.��� The interview also included two ���burning questions��� for the exchange regarding how the future will unfold. The first was whether the site would begin supporting other cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin Cash. Hirji was not forthcoming with specifics, but did indicate that companies have been given roadmaps for how to apply to join the exchange. He said: ���So we have published a digital asset framework which outlines the criteria we look at for any particular asset before we list it���You need to pass those exams before we would ever list the asset���suffice to say that we have a framework out there and we have a lot of people campaigning for new assets.��� After other discussions, including the addition of Bitcoin futures and how the market will respond to the new contracts, the interview turned to the question of taking the company public as an IPO. The potential of either another exchange purchasing the company or a future public offering was not completely rejected by the president. He said: ���We would be quite expensive for any exchange to look at. That being said, it is certainly in the interest of our investors���and the most obvious path of Coinbase is to go public at some point, but there���s a lot for us to do between now and then, whenever that date is.���	1
American businessman and investor Peter Schiff believes investors buying Bitcoin at current prices could lose everything. It���s been an interesting, and for some frightening, past few days for Bitcoin. Last week, the price of the cryptocurrency reacted favorably to the launch of Bitcoin futures on the CBOE. Exactly one week later, CME launched trading of Bitcoin futures contracts on their platform, which was met with a drop in Bitcoin���s price. Then on Wednesday, America���s biggest Bitcoin exchange, Coinbase, announced the surprise launch of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) support on its platform and exchange, GDAX. BCH price soared, while Bitcoin shuddered somewhat. Speaking to RT this week, renowned analyst Peter Schiff, credited for predicting the 2008 housing market collapse, issued a foreboding warning to investors buying Bitcoin at current prices. Even with a shaky week, Bitcoin is hovering around the $16,000 mark, after a two-month bull run that saw the price rise by more than 200 percent. Schiff says those trying to ride the bubble are too late: ���People who got it years ago, even people who got it at the beginning of the year have the opportunity to cash out and make a lot of money. But people who are buying it at these prices or higher prices are going to lose practically everything.��� The old adage, ���buy on the rumor and sell on the news,��� seems to be the perfect way to sum up Schiff���s sentiments on the current attitude of green investors trying to make a quick buck out of Bitcoin: ���These currencies are going to trade to zero or pretty close to it when the bubble pops. Right now, the only reason why people are buying Bitcoin is because the price is going up. When it turns around, they are not going to sell it for the same reason." He also voiced by now common criticism of Bitcoin Core���s transaction functionality, noting the low speed and high cost of transactions on the network: ���There is no value in Bitcoin, you can���t use it as money. It���s too slow, too expensive and too vulnerable.���	0
Cryptocurrency Markets are having a tough time, with major losses across most of the top 50 coins to start the day Wednesday, Jan. 10. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is down from $800 bln on Jan. 7 to around $709 bln Jan. 10. The main exception seems to be Ether (ETH), which is seeing almost 10 percent growth over the past day, selling at an average of $1300 at press time.  Ether is one of only two coins from the top ten that are in green this morning, joined by Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is up almost 5 percent. Ripple (XRP), the so-called cryptocurrency of banking, which showed an unprecedented growth rate starting in mid-December 2017 is recent times leading the crumbling pack with almost 17 percent losses in the past 24 hours. Ripple was trading at an average over $3 on CoinMarketCap last week, before the price tracking site removed three major South Korean exchanges from their price calculations on Monday Jan. 8. The move made the coin���s price appear to drop 30 percent and put it in third place on the market. Perhaps due in part to panic selling after Ripple���s sudden apparent drop, the altcoin has continued to fall, trading at an average of $1.95 at press time. On the 8th spot, Stellar Lumen's price has dropped almost 13 percent to $0.54. In the same vein, Cardano is at the receiving end of the ongoing market depression, also falling almost 13 percent and bringing price from over $1 to the $0.75 zone. New Economic movement (NEM) wasn't spared either, succumbing to an 11 percent decay and trading at $1.45 at press time. Dash has made it back into the top 10 coins, pushing the TRON, the altcoin that broke into the top ten last week, back to 12th place.   In suit was the Silver of Cryptocurrency, Litecoin, which lost a relatively low 2.2 percent over the past 24 hours, currently selling at $242. IOTA is now at the 9th position and posted a negative 5.84 percent along with a price of $3.45. Market leader Bitcoin has yet to fully recover from its downward trend since late December. At press time it was down 4.2 percent with a market price just over $14,000.	0
SingularityNET raised $36 mln in one minute, completely selling out of its native AGI tokens. While this is an enormous amount of money to raise in an incredibly short period of time, it���s somewhat unsurprising considering demand. The company asserts that the issue was massively oversubscribed, with 20,000 people registered to participate, seeking to buy $361 mln worth of tokens. The company reduced the number to a more manageable level, according to its press release, by: ���[Screening] all applicants using layers of algorithms, in addition to manual review, to comply with global KYC/AML regulations. This reduced the pool of contributors to 5,000, but also set a new standard for fundraising via Blockchain with respect to global legislation.���   SingularityNET aims to create a decentralized marketplace of AIs, where each AI can interact with one another (and pay one another) as needed to solve customers��� problems. Founder Ben Goertzel gave an example: ���If you need a document summarized, as a user you can put a request into SingularityNet... You may get bids from twenty different document summary nodes...and you may choose one with the right balance of reputation and price. But now that document summary node if it hits something in the document it can���t deal with, it can outsource that...if the document summary node that you���re paying...hits an embedded video it can outsource that to a video summarizing node and it can then pay it some fraction of the money it was paid. Or, if it sees a quote in Russian...it can outsource that ...to a Russian to English translation node that can do that translation, then send it back to the document summary node.��� Artificial intelligence and machine learning are hot trends in computing these days, but are largely controlled by massive corporations. These corporate titans develop their own proprietary systems and software and keep it in-house. SingularityNET intends to decentralize this heavily centralized field, allowing developers of AI tools to monetize them and non-corporate users to benefit from them. As with any new venture, it remains to be seen whether this is even possible, or whether behemoths like Google will forever dominate the field of AI. One thing is certain - there is plenty of interest in decentralized AI systems. SingularityNET���s token sale could not make that any more clear. Just like the Nicholas Cage movie, these tokens were ���gone in sixty seconds.���	2
After a pump that highlighted the power of crowd mania and meme magic, Dogecoin has tumbled nearly 40% in a retreat from $.06 Friday highs, falling as low as $.033 this morning.  For the influencers and Wall Street Bets refugees who joined in on the rise ��� many of whom were taking their first ride on what���s known to be a notoriously volatile chart ��� the price action reversal has been especially harrowing.  Doge doing what it does best, welcoming people into crypto with a huge slap in the face. https://t.co/0GpiKe4B8U Just yesterday, Dogecoin made history for cracking the top 10 cryptoassets by marketcap for the first time since 2015. The currency named after a dog meme that was started as a joke was propelled to such lofty heights on the back of similarly record-breaking social media volume, according to analytics provided by The TIE.  While some tied the rapid price appreciation to Elon Musk memes and the inevitable groupthink of crypto���s often momentum-based markets, $DOGE���s success may also be rooted in anti-establishment sentiments running rife through the retail crowd following popular trading app Robinhood disabling ���Buy��� orders for certain assets.  The move from Robinhood and other brokers prompted furious accusations of hypocrisy and speculation that hedge funds were being favored over smaller investors ��� and what's a better way to highlight a broken system than pumping a joke coin to a multi-billion dollar valuation?  $Doge it is.Elon pump it.$1. https://t.co/7pvyn2tZA7 However, after reports of withdrawal issues on multiple centralized exchanges, Dogecoin has undergone a violent overnight reversal, leading many buyers to take to social media to express their regret. Just a few hours after posting that she���d ���finally caved and bought the dog stock,��� podcast host and media personality Mia Khalifa indicated some buyer���s remorse: This is the first time I���ve ever hated a dog. Khalifa wasn���t alone in feeling the pain. Multiple streamers and social media influencers had been along for the ride, and stream viewers last night witnessed some wondering if a ���nuke��� had gone off:  Streamers watch their life savings crash after investing into $DOGE coin. pic.twitter.com/lxr3BqPAtq Seeing the value of DOGE nearly cut in half doesn���t seem to have pushed too many investors to more fundamentally sound projects, however. #DogeToADollar is currently a trending topic on Twitter, and a steady stream of users are claiming to double down.	0
Russia has long been home to a vibrant crypto retail market, yet the nation���s regulation of digital assets still lags behind. As a spate of stakeholders and disparate regulatory authorities struggles to figure out a coherent policy framework within a bureaucratic system, much of the cryptocurrency industry remains outside the realm of regulated economic activity ��� to the chagrin of many entrepreneurs. The central piece of crypto legislation ��� a bill called ���On Digital Financial Assets��� (DFA) ��� progressed through its first round of debate in Russia���s legislature in May 2018, but has remained in the works ever since, stranding the local crypto industry in legal limbo. Past few weeks saw a spike in regulators��� activity, triggered by the leak of proposed amendments to the bill that revealed a sharp prohibitive turn. Could this be an unpleasant endpoint in the authorities��� regulatory thinking, or is it merely another twist on the rocky road to a uniform approach to cryptocurrencies? It���s tough to find material on Russian governmental institutions��� stance on cryptocurrencies before October 2017. An unsurprising exception is the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), which issued its first statement on digital money in early 2014. The regulator said that issuance of ���money surrogates��� was against federal law, and warned that exchanging ���virtual currencies��� for fiat money or goods and services could be viewed as a suspicious activity under anti-money laundering and terrorism financing regulations. CBR���s opposition to legalizing circulation of cryptocurrencies has not faltered ever since. As the rate of adoption exploded, it became clear that the emerging sector requires specialized legislation. In October 2017, President Putin charged the government and CBR with legally defining financial technology concepts such as distributed ledger, cryptocurrency, token and smart contract, as well as developing regulatory frameworks for crypto mining and initial coin offerings (ICOs). According to some experts, regulators approached the task as a box-ticking exercise. Artem Tolkachev, founder and CEO of digital asset investment platform Tokenomica, told Cointelegraph: ���Given the Central Bank���s prohibitive stance and other lawmaking actors��� lack of expertise with the subject, the [presidential] order has been executed in a purely formal fashion ��� with the view to ostensibly develop regulation while refraining from taking any tangible decisions in the text. The resulting bill, ���On Digital Financial Assets,��� has gone through several editions, but it never got close to regulating the most pressing matters: the legal status of cryptocurrencies, rules for their exchange, the use of utility tokens for fundraising, rules of compliance and identification for digital asset holders.��� In order to become federal law, legislation has to pass three readings in the State Duma, Russia���s parliament. The original version of the DFA bill, registered with the Duma in March 2018, contained definitions of terms such as digital financial asset, distributed ledger of transactions, mining, cryptocurrency, token and smart contract. In May, the bill passed the first reading, only to get stuck in the now two year-long revision process ahead of the second. Apparently, amendments introduced to the bill between the readings became a battleground for various interested parties within and close to the government. George Bryanov, an expert at the faculty of finance and banking at The Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA), told Cointelegraph: ���The bill���s inhibition is due to, among other things, the sheer number of stakeholders. There are big mining companies like Nornikel and Rusal that could make use of security tokens, the CBR that wants to retain monopolistic oversight over the entire financial market, and security and revenue services that are concerned about theAnti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) aspect.��� The fog of war dims much of the power dynamics underlying the bill���s transformation in the past two years, but we can still observe milestones and tentative outcomes. The version of the text that the Duma���s Financial Market Committee put forward for the second reading was stripped of definitions of cryptocurrency and smart contracts altogether, suggesting that the CBR had the stronger hand in that round. Another factor that could hinder the legislation���s progress is the Russian crypto industry���s fundamental discontent with some of the principles that the bill codifies. Antonina Levashenko, Director of Russia-OECD Center at RANEPA, explained to Cointelegraph: ���The bill is faltering because it includes some norms with which the business community disagrees. Particularly, it restricts the use of digital currencies in a way that will lead to their illicit use and the emergence of a shadow market. [���] There is no provision for trading cryptocurrency or exchanging it for goods and services, which will result in its depreciation. In addition, there are issues with the operation of foreign-based exchanges, whose regulation in Russia is not even discussed.��� It is worth noting that the corpus of Russian law that is supposed to regulate digital asset space is not confined to the DFA bill alone. Anticipating that at least some forms of digital assets will eventually get a legal definition, lawmakers are considering or have already implemented changes to adjacent laws and codes. For one, a new object of law, called digital rights, was introduced to the Russian Civil Code in October 2019. Digital rights are defined as contractual or other rights whose substance and execution conditions are contained in an information system such as blockchain. The new clause does not offer examples of such rights, but it appears that this norm will act in conjunction with other forthcoming pieces of legislation such as the DFA law. On the law enforcement side, the Ministry of the Interior and a few other executive agencies are reportedly working on the legal framework to allow confiscation of crypto assets as part of the judicial process. On May 21, 2020, almost exactly two years after the DFA bill passed its first reading, a leaked letter from the Duma���s Financial Market Committee to the Ministry of Economic Development revealed a series of amendments that the MPs proposed to introduce to Russia���s administrative and criminal codes. The measures stipulated heavy fines for illicit use, exchange, and issuance of digital assets and digital currencies. The document���s authors also proposed to qualify the same activities on a grand scale as a felony punishable by jail time. The leaked package, which became public a few days later, also contained a new version of the DFA bill, as well as a draft of a now-separate bill on digital currencies. The latter defines crypto as property and effectively bans its issuance and exchange. Many industry experts and market participants decried the proposed measures, contending that in the present form they will effectively banish all crypto-related activity from Russia. The criticism was not limited to the crypto industry, as many departments of the government began weighing in. On June 10, the Ministry of Economic Development said in a letter to the State Duma that the proposed blanket ban would force all crypto operations out of Russia and thus put the national economy at a disadvantage. At the same time, given the transnational nature of digital money, an unregulated black market would emerge. The ministry suggested shifting the overall regulatory approach toward creating mechanisms of controlled exchange of digital currencies. On the same day, the Ministry of Communications in its own letter to the Financial Market Committee made a similar point about the dangers of creating a massive shadow market should the ban take effect. The department also stressed how the measure could hinder the development of Russia���s blockchain sector, hurt those who already own digital assets, and even negatively affect activities that are not directly related to crypto, such as businesses��� loyalty programs and crowdfunding. Notably, the letter also defends cryptocurrency mining as a ���socially beneficial commercial activity.��� A week later, the Ministry of Justice took a jab at the proposed legislation, this time on more technical grounds. The department noted that the blanket ban on exchanging cryptocurrency is at odds with the need for court enforcement officers to be able to sell digital assets confiscated in judicial proceedings. Elina Sidorenko, the Head of the State Duma���s task force on the assessment of risks posed by cryptocurrency, wrote in her Telegram channel that the prohibitive bill has ���sprung a leak,��� as it was deemed ���unsatisfactory��� by the majority of government and industry experts. She added that it is unlikely that the parliament will make any progress on this front during the summer, and suggested that the industry brace for the fall legislative session. Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Duma���s Financial Market Committee, acknowledged that the digital currencies bill proved contentious, which warrants further discussion. However, in his opinion, the ���positions are consolidated��� in the digital assets bill, making it a likely candidate for a speedy enactment.  The overwhelming negative response to the proposed blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading illustrates the diversity of views on cryptocurrency in the highest tiers of the Russian political system. While the Central Bank remains adamant that there is no place for digital money���s legal status, many other state institutions share a clear understanding that sweeping a whole thriving sector of economic activity under the rug will do more harm than good.	0
While Bitcoin and various altcoins enjoyed a record-breaking 2017, chipmakers like Nvidia also benefited from the crypto boom. The graphics card manufacturer was the top performer on the S&P 500 in the chip manufacturer category, Overall, Nvidia���s share price saw a 100% rise in 2017 - and Goldman Sachs believes that growth will bubble continue into 2018. As reported by CNBC, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told clients that they could expect chipmakers to have another bumper year on the stock market. "Nvidia is one of the few stocks in our coverage universe exposed to multiple secular growth markets. With the emergence of eSports and the potential proliferation of VR/AR, we view Gaming as a meaningful and sustainable growth driver for the overall company. In terms of single stock, our top picks in Semis and Semi Cap are Nvidia and Entegris." Growth in the gaming sector is expected to drive up the company���s share price by 7%, according to Hari. A big factor in this projected growth was the recent launch of Nvidia���s new Volta-powered Titan V graphics card in December 2017. There was plenty of hype ahead of the eventual launch of the Titan V. For $3,000, you could snap one up at this very moment, although you can only order two at a time on the Nvidia website. The chip has 5,120 CUDA cores, 640 Tensor cores and 12 GB of memory, making it the most powerful PC GPU produced to date. Nvidia claims Volta is 9x more powerful than its previous architecture, Pascal. Avid gamers who were ready to drop that amount of cash on a new GPU have already had a go with the new card. According to them, the results are impressive. A Reddit user posted a long list of games he���d benchmarked with the Titan V, all of which demonstrate impressive results. He benchmarked the Titan V at about 64 mhash/sec with Betterhash, which is 25 mhash/sec more than a 1080ti according to another user. The best technology often comes with the heftiest of price tags, and this is the case with the Titan V. Avid gamers who plan to mine cryptocurrency on the side might wait for Nvidia���s consumer version of the card. In the past, Nvidia has launched their flagship professional gaming cards, which were followed by more affordable, slightly less powerful consumer grade cards. The latest example was the Nvidia Titan, which birthed the 1080ti. The consumer-oriented 1080ti had slightly fewer CUDA cores and 11 GB of memory instead of the Titan���s 12 GB. As noted by The Register, Nvidia will ban the use of its GeForce and Titan cards in data centers around the world. Fortunately for miners, they are unaffected by these changes. The latest Nvidia GeForce licence agreement reads: ���No Datacenter Deployment. The SOFTWARE is not licensed for datacenter deployment, except that Blockchain processing in a datacenter is permitted.���	2
Microsoft, the $561 bln US-based technology company, has released the Confidential Consortium (Coco) Framework, an Ethereum-based protocol which commercial companies and large-scale organizations will be able to utilize to process information on the Ethereum Blockchain with increased privacy. In an official announcement, Mark Russinovich, the CTO at Microsoft Azure, the company���s cloud computing arm, said: ���Coco presents an alternative approach to ledger construction, giving enterprises the scalability, distributed governance and enhanced confidentiality they need without sacrificing the inherent security and immutability they expect.��� One of the most unique aspects of the Coco Framework is that it leverages local hardware-based environments such as Intel���s trusted execution environments (TEEs), to facilitate the settlement of information in an off-chain Ethereum Blockchain ecosystem. By processing data in a separate ecosystem, it allows Microsoft to provide a more functional and flexible infrastructure for decentralized applications. Previously, Cornell professor Emin Gun Sirer proposed a solution that leverages Intel���s TEE to settle Bitcoin transactions. In essence, Microsoft���s Coco Framework is similar, but utilizes smart contracts and the Ethereum protocol to focus on processing information. More importantly, as Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of Coinbase noted, Ethereum needs off-chain infrastructures like the Coco Framework if it aims to enable commercial organizations to process large amounts of information. Tom Racette, the vice president at Mojix, stated that the Coco Frameworks expands the flexibility of the existing Ethereum protocol to host decentralized applications more efficiently. "Being able to run our existing supply chain Dapp code much faster within Coco framework is a great performance improvement that will reduce friction when we talk about enterprise Blockchain readiness with our retail customers. Adding data confidentiality support without sacrificing this improvement is what will enable us to lead the digital transformation we are envisioning with Smart Supply Chains,��� said Racette. Cointelegraph previously reported that Ethereum needs off-chain scaling solutions and improvement by 100-fold in terms of scalability in order to efficiently power decentralized applications with one to 10 mln users. At the time, Ehrsam noted: ���These are hard computer science and game theory problems. Most of them have never been solved before. Estimating completion can be hard and can be far off. Large apps can���t run solely on-chain and likely never will. They need off-chain scaling solutions. While it���s tricky to make accurate estimates when combining scaling improvements, it���s conceivable we could see a 100x improvement by the end of 2018, which would allow a 1���10m user app.��� Microsoft���s Coco Framework and some other smart contract-based platforms that are being developed by organizations within the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance will further enhance Ethereum���s scalability by leveraging off-chain solutions and as a result, allow decentralized applications to secure active userbases and process large amounts of data without running into conflict with security issues.	2
FCC head Ajit Pai has managed to deal a major blow to free and neutral Internet usage by repealing the so-called Net Neutrality laws. Effectively, this allows broadband companies the power to potentially reshape Americans��� online experiences. Effectively, the likes of AT&T and Comcast now have the ability to block certain websites to their customers or even charge more for usage of them. Now, the broadband providers can influence what sites of the Internet are used. For Bitcoin, this could have huge implications as the digital currency operates totally online and within the sights of these companies. Bitcoin and its related sectors have also been eyed suspiciously by traditional monopolies, and their stance in the eyes of these broadband providers is yet to be known. For the everyday Bitcoin user, in the US for this instance, there is a pretty familiar pattern. The man on the street logs on to Coinbase buys his Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin and operates from there. The exchange is the on-ramp and the exchange is also an easy target without Net Neutrality laws. Marvin Ammori, lawyer for the advocacy group Fight for the Future told Motherboard: ���The average person goes to Coinbase to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin���the average on-ramp is an exchange, and those are easy to block. If Comcast is the monopoly provider in an area, the provider could decide there���s a preferred Bitcoin exchange.��� While this is still hypothetical, it essentially means a new weapon has been minted in the fight against Bitcoin. For instance, these ISPs, under the pressure of governments or other major institutions, could set in motion ways to stop access to cryptocurrency exchanges. The likes of Coinbase and other major exchanges have worked hard to grow their reputation and assure people of a safe cryptocurrency space. But if they are shut down or hindered to a point where they are unusable, many crypto-enthusiasts will be left stranded. However, if these ISPs do decide to let Bitcoin live on, there is every chance they will use their new-found power to squeeze the most out of them. Prefered Exchanges will be given preference - and preferred will no doubt mean centralized. According to Cornell University computer science professor Emin G��n Sirer, even if popular sites like Coinbase can pony up and pay a service provider for faster traffic in the name of good business, individual uses of Cryptocurrencies could still suffer. ���Peer-to-peer applications may be greatly affected because they���re not in the top 100 most popular destinations on the web. Providers can make the case that supporting those non-top-100 services costs more, and users have to bear that cost.��� ���My worry is it will affect the ability to run your own node.��� A ���node��� is one of many computers that communicate with each other to run the decentralized network of a cryptocurrency. Throttling nodes would require a service provider to manage traffic at the IP level, and not simply look for a particular protocol. This could put an end to many���s foray into the world of cryptocurrency, shutting down the disruptive force on many different established sectors. However, those who do stay would then be forced back down the dark path of Bitcoin���s past - onto the darknet and other illegal marketplaces.	0
A Shiba Inu (SHIB) token holder who invested thousands of dollars in the memecoin in February has partially cashed out to become a stay-at-home dad. According to a Thursday report from Fortune, a 35-year-old supermarket warehouse manager identified only as Rob invested $8,000 into SHIB when the price was roughly $0.0000001 ��� giving him an allocation of 800 billion tokens. In May, when the token price surged significantly to reach a then all-time high of more than $0.000035, Rob cashed out part of his holdings to deposit $500,000 into his bank account.  The SHIB holder still has more than $1 million worth of crypto following the token���s price surge in October. The funds have allowed him to quit his job, which paid $68,000 annually, stay at home taking care of his son and participate in online discussions about projects related to SHIB. He plans to HODL his remaining tokens.  ���We believe so strongly that there is more to achieve with Shiba,��� said Rob. "I will never take out our entire portfolio.��� The former warehouse manager is part of a new generation of crypto users achieving millionaire and even billionaire status in much the same way many Bitcoin (BTC) HODLers did following the 2017 bull run. At the time of publication, the price of SHIB is $0.000058, having gained more than 5,799,999,900% since October 2020.  Some token holders who made similar purchases to Rob when the project was listed last August are now billionaires and new whales in the crypto space. However, if holders were to liquidate such a large number of tokens in the future, it could potentially cause the SHIB price to plunge as it did in May. The SHIB token is currently ranked as the eleventh largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization according to CoinMarketCap, with Dogecoin (DOGE) sitting at ninth. At the time of publication, the market cap of SHIB is roughly $32.6 billion with more than 549 trillion tokens in circulation.	2
In a move that will have far-reaching implications, Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp has halted all cryptocurrency related wire transfers, effective immediately, per a report from Fortune. The information came from statements by Metropolitan customers who were informed that the bank would be ���ceasing all international crypto-related wire transfers.��� The decision is highly significant for the cryptocurrency industry. Metropolitan Bank has earned a reputation for being Bitcoin-friendly, according to Fortune, which will likely impact its stock price. For example, Metropolitan is reportedly one of the main service providers for US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The bank���s official position has not yet been made clear, but it appears that the risk of inability of verification for international cryptocurrency transactions has led to the move. The need to meet Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations has increased the potential for increased regulation in the currently loose cryptocurrency climate. Friday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that an international effort to control and manage transfers in cryptocurrency could be forthcoming.	0
Today, Jan. 9. the Chairman & CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, spoke ambiguously about cryptocurrency, noting he regretted calling Bitcoin a ���fraud��� earlier, and was not particularly interested in the subject. He made his comments in an exclusive interview with Fox Business at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco. In September 2017 at a banking conference, Dimon called Bitcoin a "fraud" and said that he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded Bitcoin on the company���s accounts, in part for being ���stupid���. He also told Fox Business today that he ���regrets��� making the September comments, but is ���not interested that much in the subject at all.��� However, despite his lack of interest, Dimon made an ambiguous statement about the government���s relationship to Bitcoin, telling Fox Business: ���The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people.��� Though it is unclear exactly what Dimon intended to say with these words, in the context of his earlier comments on the subject from 2015, he may have meant that cryptocurrency would eventually become fully government-controlled. In 2015, responding to a question about the potential for a decentralized ���shadow economy��� of cryptocurrencies, Dimon stated more clearly: ���It���s just not gonna happen, you���re wasting your time. This is my personal opinion. There will be no real non-controlled currency in the world. There���s no government that���s gonna put up with it for long.��� During the Jan. 9 interview with Fox, Dimon asserted, as he did in 2015, that the viable digital currencies will be those that are government-backed, or fiat, such as a digital yen or dollar: ���You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO's you have to look at individually.��� Dimon seemed optimistic about Blockchain technology, noting: ���The blockchain is real.��� In 2017, multiple governments around the world announced that they were considering implementing a national digital currency. Others, such as Venezuela, have already done so. An earlier version of this article implied that Dimon's 2015 statements were in fact made Jan. 9, 2018. The text has been edited to clarify timing.

Bitcoin (BTC) gained ironic support from United States President Donald Trump on March 27 after he appeared to say he supported manipulating the dollar. In a press conference quoted by various Twitter commentators, including Blockstream CSO, Samson Mow, Trump defended the Federal Reserve printing more than $6 trillion. ���The beautiful thing about our country is $6.2 trillion ��� because it is 2.2 plus 4 ��� it���s $6.2 trillion, and we can handle that easily because of who we are, what we are,��� he said. ���It���s our money; we are the ones, it���s our currency.��� While Trump did not provide any further explanation of his train of thought, he appeared to endorse the Fed providing the astronomical sum of liquidity for the U.S. market. In turn, the dollar supply would be heavily expanded. It is this form of meddling in the money supply that forms a central tenet of Bitcoin as a financial solution. The coronavirus epidemic emboldened its supporters, who watched on as the Fed admitted that it had ���infinite��� money. ���How much did we pay Trump to advertise #Bitcoin?��� Mow summarized.  Bitcoin versus U.S. 10-year bond returns. Source: Skew.com Reactions to the giant $6.2 trillion meanwhile continue to appear, as various cryptocurrency users showed their surprise. Hodlonaut, the organizer of last year���s Lightning Torch transaction relay, argued that under an unlimited money situation, paying taxes made no logical sense. Caitlin Long, the ex-Goldman Sachs executive who subsequently pioneered friendly Bitcoin regulatory approaches in Wyoming, described the monetary intervention as killing capitalism. She also warned that the Fed���s balance sheet would more than double before the coronavirus crisis abated to more than $10 trillion.  ���In short-term, huge dollar demand bc short-covering, but it won't last,��� part of a tweet posted on Friday read. For scale, $6 trillion is the equivalent of the entire U.S. gross domestic product in 1990, or enough to buy almost 70% of the world���s gold supply at spot price.	2
Berkshire Hathaway, the $503 billion conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, sold Goldman Sachs for a Canadian gold company Barrick Gold. Max Keiser, the founder of Heisenberg Capital and an early Bitcoin investor, says it could help buoy BTC to $50,000. The quarterly shareholder filing of Berkshire Hathaway shows Buffett trimmed his position on most major banks, Fortune reported on Aug. 15. The firm sold a substantially large portion of its shares in JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and PNG. Buffett���s decision to completely close Berkshire���s position on Goldman Sachs follows the bank���s second-ever highest quarterly trading revenue of $13.3 billion. It suggests Buffett is not comfortable in betting big on the banking industry in the long-term. Instead, Buffett purchased a single stock in Barrick Gold, whose stock has reflected that of gold in most of 2020. The firm is a gold mining company based in Canada, which recorded a 45% increase year-to-date. Following Berkshire���s investment, the stock rose by 8.11% in after-hours trading. Max Keiser, an avid Bitcoin investor who has invested in companies like Kraken and Bitfinex, believes Buffett���s gold investment could benefit Bitcoin. He said the positive sentiment around gold implies a higher valuation for Bitcoin, which some consider as ���digital gold.��� Keiser said: ���Global $100 trillion fund management biz is less than 1% invested in Gold. With Buffett now moving into Gold. Expect global allocation of 5% AU min. Implies $5,000 Gold. Expect a 1% BTC global allocation ($1 trillion). This implies $50,000 for Bitcoin Expect PTJ ups to 10%.���  The weekly price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.com A former L/S equities portfolio manager and Ikigai Fund founder Travis Kling echoed a similar sentiment. Referring to Buffett���s skeptical statement in 1998 around gold saying it doesn���t have utility, Kling said: ���Today it was announced Berkshire Hathaway just bought its first gold stock ever. The reasons are self-apparent at this point. Just in case you���re wondering what the coming years are going to look like for Bitcoin, this was Buffett on gold in 1998.��� Although Bitcoin has outperformed gold since April, the price trend between gold and BTC has shown some correlation. Data from Skew show the two assets have increased in tandem throughout the past four months.  The correlation between Bitcoin and gold. Source: Skew.com The simultaneous rally of Bitcoin and gold since the global market crash in late March hints that more investors are starting to consider BTC as a store of value. Most recently, MicroStrategy, a $1.4 billion intelligence conglomerate, purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin. The firm said BTC would act as the company���s primary treasury asset, acknowledging Bitcoin as a store of value and a potential safe-haven asset.	2
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has posted a lengthy paper on the limits to blockchain scalability, criticizing claims made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The article, published on Buterin���s personal blog on Sunday, emphasizes the trade-off between decentralization and scalability in architecting blockchain networks. The article comes in response to Elon Musk���s May 15 tweet asserting that Dogecoin will emerge as the leading chain if it moves to increase its block size by 900%: Buterin challenged Musk���s proposition, emphasizing the challenge of seeking to achieve a sharp increase in scalability and throughput ���without leading to extreme centralization and compromising the fundamental properties that make a blockchain what it is.��� Buterin stressed the need for decentralization to eliminate the risk of a network having a single point of failure and the protections that a widely distributed network enjoys against coordinated attacks. He added that decentralization cannot be achieved without regular users being freely able to run nodes. Buterin also asserted that sharding can facilitate comparable scalability to that offered by many centralized chains. Based on the current state of the Ethereum network, Buterin predicts that a sharded Ethereum could ���probably process one a million transactions per second with the full security of a blockchain.��� ���But it���s going to take work to do this without sacrificing the decentralization that makes blockchains so valuable,��� he added. In March, the Ethereum co-founder suggested that rollups will be deployed on Ethereum before sharding ships with Ethereum 2.0.  UPDATE: Elon Musk responded to Buterin via a comment on this article on Twitter. The tweet is embedded below. He fears the ��� pic.twitter.com/78WzM5ICjA	2
The South Korean cryptocurrency market accounts for a relatively small percentage of global Bitcoin trades, but has nonetheless played a crucial role in bringing RIpple���s market capitalization from $40 billion to $88 billion. Ripple was one of the best-performing crypto assets of 2017, boasting a 360x increase in value. Exactly one year ago, on January 1, 2017, a single Ripple sold just six-tenths of a cent. Today, a single token is worth $2.29. Over the past week, Ripple overtook Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency in the global market, becoming the first ���altcoin��� to reach a $100 billion market valuation. Many investors, especially Ethereum and Bitcoin holders, were taken aback by Ripple���s sudden surge. Analysts have attributed the recent increase in the value of Ripple to the formation of strategic partnerships between SBI Ripple Asia and South Korean banks, according to Forbes. However, the newly partnered banks will only begin processing payments on the Ripple network by the end of the first quarter of 2018. This has led some to question whether these partnerships are the real reason for Ripple���s incredible surge. One such skeptic is Ryan Selkis, entrepreneur-in-residence at Ethereum-focused Blockchain production studio ConsenSys said in an interview: "I know of no banks that are a) using it, or b) would touch it in any way as it is controlled by a SV company and 20% of all XRP in existence were taken by the founders. The product that Ripple are offering to banks is simply a point-to-point messaging tool with some smart cryptography underneath to ensure that transactions are atomic. The liquidity model used is the same as correspondent banking. Some banks will have deep pools of liquidity available to terminate payments. Ripple's approach with XRP has been to get it listed on a bunch of exchanges and ���infer' but never explicitly say that banks are using it for settlement.��� The claim that no banks are using the Ripple network to process payments is not entirely accurate. Earlier this year, major Swedish bank SEB settled $180 million on the Ripple Blockchain network by sending cross-border payments on behalf of high profile clients. Banks in Thailand and Japan have also been processing near-instantaneous transactions for many months using Ripple. However, it is true that no major banks are utilizing the Ripple Blockchain network on a daily basis to process large volumes of transactions. Tony Lyu, the founder and CEO of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit, told the New York Times that the South Korean market is heavily driven by FOMO, or fear of missing out. Lyu said: ���Word just spreads really fast in Korea. Once people are invested, they want everyone else to join the party. There���s been this huge, almost a community movement around this.��� Over the past week, the South Korean market and its largest cryptocurrency exchanges including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit have accounted for more than half of Ripple���s $4.5 bln daily trading volume. South Koreans continue to pay a premium for their digital currency. On Bithumb, for instance, Ripple is being traded at $2.54, nearly 24 percent higher than the global average price.  Caption: Price of Ripple and other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb Speculation and cryptocurrency mania in the South Korean market have become a major concern for the government policy makers. South Korean financial authorities have prohibited foreigners and underaged investors from investing in cryptocurrencies in an effort to bring the speculation under control.	2
In May 2017, investors and spectators alike saw Bitcoin price pass the value of $2,300. This figure marks the highest peak of Bitcoin���s value in its entire lifetime. Due to the success of Bitcoin over the years, many investors have been attracted to it and other cryptocurrencies as well. However, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that has risen in value. Another leading cryptocurrency known as Ethereum has also ascended in value since January 2017. From its value of about $8 at the year���s start, it has gone on to attain a figure of more than $350, and despite the recent correction haggles around this level. It has been within the last few years that cryptocurrencies have gained much favor among investors who are looking for alternative means of investing other than the traditional investment mediums. While most investors still have their money invested in traditional financial markets, such as the stock market and the forex market, a lot of these investors have become worried about the economic climate of the world economy. With recent events pointing to its inherent instability, many investors have been looking to other means of investment where they can put their money. With the creation and popularization of cryptocurrency, as well as its sharp rise in value, many investors, especially those from Asia, have joined in on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trend. While most people are more familiar with Bitcoin, Ethereum has also gained its fair share of the market. However, the key difference between the two lies in the technology used by Ethereum and Bitcoin. The difference in the system would be that Ethereum���s data processing is much faster than Bitcoin, as Ethereum���s system automatically applies the terms and conditions of a contract once it has been agreed upon. While many might think that Ethereum may be inferior to Bitcoin because its price value is lower, this is actually a good thing for potential investors who are looking for means of investing other than Bitcoin. The lower price may attract more investors as there is more room for growth. The only drawback would be that Ethereum is not as well established as Bitcoin. In consideration of this, Bitcoin is safer than Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies have made their mark ever since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, and they are continuing to grow. In fact, the value of legitimate cryptocurrencies has grown much since that time. Though cryptocurrencies are doing very well this year, analysts foresee that when the economic climate is better, investors will go back to traditional investment mediums and leave cryptocurrencies. When this happens, the volatility of cryptocurrencies will go down due to the decrease in demand. Of course, the next few years will still see the growth of cryptocurrencies, which will help the industry remain quite strong. While this is all happening, it would definitely be a good idea for investors to hold on to their cryptocurrencies as they continue to strive for future growth.

Following a volatile few days in the crypto markets this week, with Bitcoin (BTC) dipping below $7000 for the first time since November, 2017, several crypto experts have predicted an overall bull run. Experts told CNBC today, Feb. 7, that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies could reach $1 trillion and that BTC itself could hit $50,000 by the end of this year. Jamie Burke, CEO at Outlier Ventures, Europe���s first Blockchain-based incubator, told CNBC that the predicted bull run will be followed by a general settling down of the market: "We believe after February the market will likely go on a bull run comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in where the market becomes more focused on proper market fundamentals.��� Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business at Gatecoin, sees regulation, the introduction of institutional capital, and technological advances like the Lightning Network as the main factors in rising cryptocurrency prices. He told CNBC over email: "There is no reason why we couldn't see bitcoin pushing $50,000 by December." Back in April 2017 when BTC reached a former high of $1,300, Glucksmann had commented on the connection between the price jump and the start of the US Securities and Exchange Commission���s (SEC) month-long review of the Winklevoss twins Bitcoin ETF proposal. The joint SEC and The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) hearings held yesterday, Feb. 6, on their roles in the cryptocurrency sphere may have helped cause the market to see substantial rebound today, Feb. 7. Glucksmann also wrote that a possible element in market growth going forward could be the release of a cryptocurrency-based ETF, similar to when BTC���s price shot up to $16,800 in Dec. 2017 after the CBOE���s futures launch: "One possible appetizer for the bulls, or the catalyst for the recovery, will be the release of another cryptocurrency backed instrument listed on a major exchange. There are several candidates in the pipeline, it's only a matter of time until we have a cryptocurrency backed ETF (exchange-traded fund)." Utility tokens like IOTA, NEO, and Ethereum are also something to watch in the coming months, CEO of Hercules Tech Mick Sherman told NBC: "Utility tokens and assets with a working platform and a clear-cut reason for requiring both a blockchain and their own token, are more likely to appreciate in value this year. Some of these cryptoassets will not be used for years, meaning they have no utility value.��� Ran Neuner, host of CNBC���s show CryptoTrader, has pinned his Feb. 1 tweet that predicted Bitcoin hitting $50,000 at the end of 2018: For the record, I am pinning this tweet. Bitcoin will finish 2018 at $50 000.	2
Following in the footsteps of several major banks globally, the Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), one of the largest banks in North America, announced  in an email statement to customers on Friday, Feb. 23, that it is banning the purchase of cryptocurrency with credit cards, local journal The Globe and Mail reports. A representative of TD, the first major Canadian bank to enact such a ban, said that the bank regularly evaluates its policies and security measures ���in order to serve and protect our customers, as well as the bank.��� TD���s move is part of a larger global trend of banks banning customers from credit card purchases of cryptocurrency. The wave of bans was initiated by US giants J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup on Feb. 3, and followed by the largest bank in the UK, Lloyds Banking Group, Feb. 5, and Virgin Money in Australia, South Africa, and the UK on Feb. 6. Last week, Citibank India went ahead with banning both credit and debit cards for crypto purchases. According to The Globe and Mail on Feb. 23, the Royal Bank of Canada made of point of stating that it does allow both debit and credit card purchases of cryptocurrency, but it warns its customers about high volatility risks which "could expose them to substantially higher debt levels than they are able to repay.��� In a contrasting move for the local industry, on Feb. 13, a Canadian stock exchange announced that it will soon launch its own Blockchain-based securities clearing and settlement platform that help companies raise funds via fully regulated security tokens issued by the exchange.	0
The cryptocurrency market took an absolute hammering on Tuesday, Jan. 16 in what is being described as ���Black Tuesday.��� Bitcoin and various altcoins suffered over 40 percent losses in market capitalization on Tuesday amid regulatory uncertainty in South Korea and China. The FUD led to a black day for cryptocurrency markets - arguably worse than the massive price correction that hit Bitcoin in the lead up to Christmas, after it had hit an all-time high of $20,000. As per usual, crypto enthusiasts from all walks of life took to social media to share their thoughts, hopes and fears amid another shaky day in the world of cryptocurrencies. Canadian twitter user Armin van Bitcoin posted an interesting and widely shared graph comparing similar corrections in the price of Bitcoin in January for the past four years. There seems to be a pattern here. ? #bitcoin #hodl pic.twitter.com/UOAfelOKcE Another user also noted the trend, followed by a suggestion that a recovery would follow.

Why?  1) Traders paying taxes  2) Traders and Whales that waited to take profits until after the first of the year  3) Whales pushing the price down to let Wall Street money in (it's bonus season)  4) Weak Hands #HODL $BTC Angel investor Jason Calacanis made a short list of characteristics to be wary of amid the massive correction: A quick reminder when gambling on crypto:  1. Unregulated  2. Highly manipulated  3. there is no use care other than money transfer & speculation  4. Easily regulated by governments  5. Meme-driven investing is a brand new thing #HODL!  6.

With all the hubbub about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in the news, Ethereum has been overlooked by some. However, the Ethereum Developer team has just released word that the Metropolis hard fork is set to occur in late September of this year. The hard fork has been widely anticipated after the Ethereum road map for 2017 was released earlier this year. The map indicated that the coming release would contain some major upgrades for the platform. The announcement earlier in the year indicated a three to six-month window for release, and late September is right on the cusp of a full six months. While the timing is later than many had hoped, the news is a welcome encouragement for those seeking Ethereum upgrades. The new hard fork should enable some significant upgrades. First, increasing anonymity will come with new ���zk-SNARKs,��� or Zero-knowledge proofs. Users will be able to perform anonymous transactions at higher levels than in the past. Second, programming and smart contracts will be made far easier with the new upgrade, relieving some of the pressure on current programmers. Gas will also be adjusted for bill settling. Third, masking for security enthusiasts will allow users to determine the address for which they have a private key. This will increase security on the network, even against quantum computer hacking. Finally, the upgrade includes a ���Difficulty-Bomb��� intended to make mining exponentially more difficult. The bomb is designed to be an intermediate step in the transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) on the network. This has often been referred to as the ���Ethereum Ice Age.���   It remains unclear whether the upgrade will cause prices to increase or decrease. As mining slows, the price may fall. However, the upgrades should increase the amount of users on the system overall, causing the price to rise. Regardless, Metropolis is the penultimate stop on the road map - Serenity, the next upgrade, should produce an increase in stability, causing greater investment and price support.	2
Private messaging app Telegram is considering the biggest Pre-ICO in history to fund its new Blockchain platform and cryptocurrency. As TechCrunch reports today citing ���multiple sources,��� Telegram is aiming to raise up to $500 mln in private sales. Its forthcoming Telegram Open Network (TON) would use the tokens for internal user payments. Cointelegraph originally reported on TON in December, the scale of the endeavor only now becoming apparent. According to sources, a series of private presales alone would raise ���as much as $500 mln,��� while the subsequent public distribution phase is planned to drive the value of the token to between $3 to $5 bln. This would make Telegram���s ICO easily the largest ever to have launched, dwarfing Block.One���s $700 mln offering last month. Investors ���beyond the inner circle��� of CEO Pavel Durov may face a minimum $20 mln buy-in, TechCrunch continues, while others may be restricted to purchasing TON tokens with fiat, rather than Bitcoin or Ethereum as with previous ICOs. ���Top-tier institutional investment firms have expressed interest, but Durov is said to be wary of accepting their cash,��� the publication reports as Russia continues its uncertain regulatory treatment of public digital token sales. Telegram has faced controversy in recent months specifically in Russia after it refused to hand over user data to authorities in line with privacy laws. A potential launch for the Telegram wallet has been set at Q4 this year, with the full package of services following in 2019.	2
This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Tether is under the spotlight amid a massive pullback in the cryptocurrency market. The top 50 cryptocurrencies saw massive price corrections last week, coming to a head on Feb. 2. The total market capitalization dropped to just over $400 bln at the time of writing- amid massive uncertainty across the board.  Almost overshadowed, but not forgotten, is the news that Bitfinex along with Tether received subpoenas from US regulators in December, who have had their eyes on the exchange and cryptocurrency. This in itself is understandable, but industry experts have raised concerns over the last few months in relation to the increase in supply of Tether which correlated with rallies in the market. Bitfinex, which is the largest exchange in the world, threatened legal action to parties that had accused the exchange of misconduct. The reason for allegation is quite predictable. Bitfinex issues Tether tokens which are issued for US dollars on a 1:1 ratio.  In simple terms, Bitfinex were accused of not having 1:1 reserves of dollars to issued Tether tokens. The problem is that because one Tether token equals one dollar, it has been used to buy other cryptocurrencies because of its standardized value. This culminated in suggestions that the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had been inflated because people had been buying cryptocurrencies with Tether and not actual US dollars. If Bitfinex does not have an equal reserve of dollars to back up the amount of Tether tokens in existence, things could end badly. As quoted by the NYTimes, Pantera Capital���s Co-chief Investment officer Joey Krug said Tether tokens were issued during recent rallies in the market. ���This became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen. It could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.��� Cointelegraph reported in Nov. 2017 that Tether had seen a 10,000 percent increase in supply in the space of a year, leading to some serious head-scratching about how the company behind Bitfinex and Tether had increased its value in such a short amount of time. Tether has previously claimed that it has $2.2 bln in reserve, backing up figures shown on its transparency page online. Tether eventually hired Friedmann LLP to conduct an audit to put an end to concerns around legitimacy of its reserves. To compound matters, news broke this week that the relationship between Tether and the auditing firm came to an end - it's not clear what led to the breakdown in that relation. More importantly, there is no word on what Friedmann LLP found during their audit. Litecoin founder Charlie Lee posted an insightful take on Twitter addressing the current state of affairs surrounding Tether. Lee said the fact that Tether tokens (USDT) have continued to be issued after the Commodity Futures Trading Commision issued their subpoena in December 2017 is a good sign. However, he cautioned that if it comes to light that there isn���t a sufficient reserve of dollars to back Tether tokens, the price of the token will crash completely. But most importantly, Lee believes that eventuality will no have a direct effect on Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market. 1/ With respect to the Tether situation, it's expected for CFTC to subpoena Bitfinex to investigate if there are any wrongdoings. The fact that the subpoena is in December 2017 and they have still continued issuing USDT is good news.   USDT is just like any other altcoin.	1
Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world, according to Pew Research Center, there are about 1.6 bln Muslims in the world and they make up roughly 23 percent of the world���s population. The majority of the world���s Muslims live in Asia Pacific in countries like Indonesia and India even though traditionally areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa are traditionally associated with Islam. There are unique needs of Muslims when it comes to banking and finance. The Islamic Canonical Law, popularly known as Sharia is based on the teachings of the Quran and prohibits certain activities such as acceptance of specific interest which is considered usury (Riba) or investments in businesses which are contrary to Islamic acceptance for example alcohol. Recent interest in Islamic banking has risen with even the International Monetary Fund���s executive board holding the first ever discussion on Islamic Banking. Fintech and developments around Blockchain have been taking the world by the storm. The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and developments in Blockchain have also touched the Islamic world. In fact, the UAE has already got a Bitcoin exchange by the name of BitOasis and they also offer services like a Bitcoin Wallet. BitOasis also offers services in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. There are also services in the APAC region like Bitcoin Indonesia and Coinbox in Malaysia that offer Bitcoin-related services. According to the paper ���Bitcoin in Islamic Banking and Finance��� by Charles W. Evans, ���The relationship between a distributed, autonomous Blockchain management systems (BMS) like Bitcoin���also referred to as a 'virtual currency'���and Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF). It shows that a BMS can conform with the prohibition of riba (usury)���as Bitcoin does���and incorporate the principles of maslaha (social benefits of positive externalities) and mutual risk-sharing (as opposed to risk-shifting). With regard to maslaha, the world's unbanked number in the billions and represent the majority of the world's adults.��� In order to deeply understand this topic, we talked with Matthew J. Martin of Blossom Finance, a fintech startup based in Indonesia. Blossom Finance offers microfinance services that help entrepreneurs and small businesses. Matthew is a Muslim American based out of Indonesia and has worked with fintech startups like Boku and Xoom in the past. He told us that Bitcoin can be considered both a currency and a payment network and this distinction is important because the Sharia principles that apply vary. Matthew explains, ���As a payment network, Bitcoin is halal. In fact, Bitcoin goes beyond what more conventional closed banking networks offer. Unlike conventional bank networks which use private ledgers where there's no guarantee that the originator actually owns the underlying assets, Bitcoin guarantees with mathematical certainty that the originator of the transfer owns the underlying assets. Conventional banks operate using the principle of fractional reserve, which is prohibited in Islam.��� What is more Bitcoin may be more Halal than modern fiat money. Matthew puts it quite clearly as he remarks, ���Bitcoin is more halal than any currency in wide circulation today but probably still falls short of the strict and narrow definition of money in Islam. Modern sovereign currencies are based on debt with usury - this is strictly prohibited in Islam. Therefore, all modern money is not halal. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not based on debt - it's based on a proof of work - and this is at least not haram (impermissible).��� In understanding how Sharia looks at money, we are told by Matthew that there is a concept of Gharar (uncertainty) and contracts shouldn���t be unnecessarily uncertain. While Bitcoin was rather volatile in the past, there is stability now seen in Bitcoin over the last few years. There are also possibilities in Islamic Banking that may work in favor of Bitcoin as well. In the case of Bitcoin, there are two benefits that are clearly visible. If Bitcoin is indeed more halal and fiat currencies are haram due to the way they originate, then creating settlement systems in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could make a great deal of sense. Then there is also the case of microfinance, a field in which Matthew���s company works. He thinks here the possibilities are more realistic, ���I think the immediate opportunities lie in micro - microfinance and micro-takeful, for example. I also see huge potential in the use of smart contracts for cross-border crowdfunding and also Islamic modes of financing, such as mudaraba/musharakah (profit sharing) and muraba. I think there's also an interesting angle for micro-takeful (sharia-compliant insurance) to use crypto.��� An interesting question is whether Bitcoin is money according to Islam. Islam supports intrinsic commodities that can be used as currency. Paper or electronic money can also be used but they should be backed by an intrinsic commodity. So is Bitcoin money then? Matthew says No, ���Historically, though, Islam has only recognized commodities of intrinsic value as money including things like gold (Dinar), silver (Dirham); rice, dates, wheat, barley and salt. In a strict interpretation of what qualifies as money, Bitcoin probably misses the mark.���	2
A man���s life savings disappeared from a Ledger brand Nano hardware wallet after Reddit user moodyrocket purchased the wallet second-hand on eBay. The stolen coins amount to over $34,000. According to posts on Reddit, the seller of the wallet utilized a ���man in the middle��� attack, inserting his own recovery seed rather than the random seed assigned by the manufacturer. According to the post: ���I have not used my Ledger in a week, today I decide to check the value of my XRP, Litecoin and Dash only to discover that all of them showed up as zero and had been transferred somewhere else yesterday all around the same time at 7:30pm. I am not sure how this is possible as I have not access my Ledger in a week. I do not know what do to as the total value is over ��25000, has by currency been stolen or is it something else? I am at a lost here and right now feel so physical sick. Some please help.��� The post shows the extent to which thieves will go to access coin wallets. Ledger���s CEO (user murzika) has offered to help ���bring the seller to justice��� through legal means. As values of cryptocurrencies continue to increase, the reality of security needs continues to increase. Stories of theft and hacking continue to proliferate. For individual users some additional technology may eventually be required. Vadim Onishchenko, CEO of Blockchain photo sharing system Selfllery told Cointelegraph: "We used to ask ourselves: Where is it better to keep your money, at home in a safe or in the bank? None of these options is ever completely safe. Cryptocurrency is no different: the safety issue is very complex, because there are lots of ways to break into accounts, or to force people to give over their holdings. There needs to be a mechanism ensuring complete safety, because the current options are all lacking. A new technology is needed to protect cryptocurrency."	0
Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume according to CoinMarketCap, has had to continuously refute accusations of a hack since their exchange has unexpectedly  gone offline due to server issues. The time offline was supposed to only last for several hours, but, similarly to the extended Kraken downtime of over two days in January, Binance has since announced that they will only be back online on Feb. 9 at 4am (UTC) (11:00pm EST). While Kraken was chastised by its users for its relative silence and only sporadic update during its 48 hours of no service, both the Binance exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have been updating their Twitters about every two hours with progress reports and assurances that they have not been hacked: We will maintain communication at difficult times. Those are hot wallets, only a tiny % there. But it should be clear your coins are safe. We wish disks moved faster. We will engineer around them in the future. Your encouraging words is all we work for. https://t.co/1i0Dw3YjV1 However, some on Twitter have repeatedly accused Binance of covering up a hack, most notably crypto persona John McAfee, who tweeted that while he wasn���t ���trying to spread FUD,��� he���d been receiving multiple reports alleging that Binance was really hacked In response, Binance tweeted that ���Blockchain thankfully provides a public ledger that can disprove any FUD��� and provided their Ethereum wallet and Bitcoin wallet addresses to prove that all money is there. Zhao also responded to McAfee by saying that he would, ���prove him wrong���: But you are spreading fud. We will prove you wrong. https://t.co/QTuK6t2ZS3 At press time, both the Bitcoin and Ethereum storages provided by Binance show positive balances of $263 mln and $151 mln worth of coins respectively.	2
Facebook has updated its advertising policy, announcing in a blog post Tuesday, Jan. 30 that it prohibits ads that use ���misleading or deceptive promotional practices,��� which, according to the social media platform, includes ads of cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The move may come as a surprise for some crypto followers, after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg expressed a desire to study cryptocurrency deeply in 2018. His comment that cryptocurrencies ���take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands��� appeared to be a less-than-negative opinion on their potential and how the company could ���best to use them in [its] services." The announcement claims that there are ���many companies��� that use Facebook���s platform to advertise financial products, such as binary options, cryptocurrencies and ICOs, but do so ���[not operating] in good faith���. Because of that, the blog post continues, Facebook is going to make it ���harder for scammers to profit��� from a presence on the social platform by banning all such ads. The announcement also encourages the users to help police the community by reporting content that violates the new rule. ���Two of our core advertising principles outline our belief that ads should be safe, and that we build for people first,��� said Facebook. While the ban is ���intentionally broad��� to start with, the blog post does offer a glimmer of hope for ICOs and cryptocurrencies interested in advertising on Facebook���s many platforms. The post indicates that the company intends to ���revisit this policy and how [they] enforce it as [their] signals improve.��� Other social media giants like Twitter have also faced their share of Bitcoin and Blockchain scams. A number of retweet trolls have been recently seeking fame through fake offers of Bitcoin giveaways. However, while Facebook and others are seeking to produce a safer environment free of potential scams, others in the social media world are seeking to remove just this type of censorship from platforms through Blockchain technology. Some industry insiders see the move as preemptive and overly stringent. For example, Dejun Qian, Founder of FUSION, said, ���This policy will definitely protect people from the scams of predatory projects. However announcing an ���intentionally broad��� policy is always the easiest way and not necessarily the best route for technology development. I don���t believe that banning e-commerce ads just because people face the risk of buying counterfeited products is a good idea.���	0
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped another 1,000 points Thursday, Feb. 8, making it the second time in four days that the traditional market has fallen more than 1,000 points.   The S&P 500 Index is also down 3.75 percent by press time, which is its lowest point since mid-November, according to the Boston Globe.   As the market is experiencing its fifth loss over the past six days, the Boston Globe writes that Friday announcement by the Labor Department that workers��� salaries grew quickly in January may have caused investors to scramble, thinking that interest rate would also rise.   Unlike the drop three days ago, which was the largest intraday drop in 6 and a half years, today���s traditional market slump has not correlated with the crypto markets as strongly.   While Bitcoin (BTC) had dropped below $7000 on Feb. 5 when the Dow Jones had dropped about 1,100 points, Bitcoin is now trading at around $8,219.12 according to Coin Market Cap, up 6.08% over a 24-hour period by press time.   Ethereum and Ripple are also trading at $816.98 and $0.80 respectively, up 4.8 and 8.96 percent over a 24-hour period by press time.   The lack of a similar drop in the crypto markets may be due to the lifeline it received after the The Commodities and Future Trading Commission and the US Securities Exchange Commission joint hearing on Tuesday.   Users on Twitter have joked that the recent traditional market volatility has begun to mirror the volatility common to the crypto markets:   Dow J straight up looking like crypto currencies #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency #DowJones pic.twitter.com/GcLirpSflc	2
We have posted a follow-up to this article, located here. Cointelegraph recently began receiving complaints about the Bittrex exchange disabling users��� accounts for no apparent reason. One consistent theme in every complaint we���ve received is that users have attempted to open tickets and have even sought help on the exchange���s Slack, only to be ignored and banned, respectively. One user complained that he has six Bitcoin in his Bittrex account--over $30,000 at today���s values--and no longer has access to his funds and receives no answers to his support tickets. Another user comments: ���My Bittrex account is disabled for more than 3 days without any warning or announcement. Their support do not answer anything.��� Another wrote: ���Although we submitted tickets about this issue to their support team, they with all obscenity and indecency, instead of responding to their users��� tickets, they just ignore us.��� Still another user suggested the bans may be tied to users��� nationalities. He wrote: ���In Iran, more than 3,000 accounts have been deactivated without reason.��� Another Bittrex customer emailed us, saying: ���I talked to many users in Telegram groups and the most affected countries are Syria, India, Iran, Russia, Pakistan and Turkey.��� Many of those who emailed us pointed out that they are using verified accounts, suggesting that it isn���t a KYC/AML problem. At least two threads have been started on the Bitcointalk forum, here and here. The affected customers are all getting the same message when they attempt to log in to their account:  Bittrex did not respond to our request for comment. Bittrex.com/news is blank. An attempt to sign up for their Slack channel failed, with the message ���invite_limit_reached.��� Bittrex���s Facebook page simply directs any users with problems to go to their support website and file a ticket. There is no announcement on Twitter, and only one official reply to the numerous tweets that have been directed at them: please contact https://t.co/d1UGFIFtWU It���s extremely unusual for an exchange to suddenly disable thousands of accounts without any announcement or any replies to support tickets. It���s even more bizarre that Bittrex is apparently banning people for asking for help in their support Slack. But these aren���t the only weird goings-on at Bittrex lately. Blogger ���The CryptoSyndicate��� posted last week suggesting that an internal mistake at Bittrex caused an exchange-wide selloff of altcoins, triggering declines on all other major exchanges. The CryptoSyndicate writes: ���Basically, every single cryptocurrency (alts) listed on Bittrex has fallen in a very similar pattern in relation to one another. Not every coin, but coins that are listed on Bittrex. Between the hours of 12:00 and 09:00 at UTC-4 on 8th October 2017, a large number of alts experienced a mass dump executed within minutes of each other. Coincidence?��� He speculates that this could be the result of an error related to exchange fees; namely, that Bittrex may have accidentally dumped the fees it had collected on every trading pair all at once, converting them to Bitcoin and causing the price of each altcoin to fall. He continues: ���No other exchange has experienced these patterns in their assets. Cryptocurrencies that were NOT listed on Bittrex were not affected in the same way. Every other exchange we looked at, Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, GDAX, Coss, Cryptopia, Yobit ��� all experienced patterns that were indicative of market reaction stemming from a single source of flash sell-down: Bittrex.��� Following the monumental collapse of Mt. Gox a few years ago, it���s no wonder people are easily alarmed when dealing with exchanges. Since you don���t actually control the private key to your funds--the exchange does--you don���t actually have custody of them. If anything goes wrong, be it a hack, theft, or simply a database error, you stand to lose everything. Mt. Gox customers learned this the hard way. When Mt. Gox collapsed in early 2014, users lost access to 850,000 Bitcoins that were held by the site, although 200,000 Bitcoins were later ���found,��� bringing the total loss to 650,000 Bitcoins. At today���s prices, that���s a staggering $3.5 bln. Even exchanges that remain solvent can sorely test their users��� patience. Cointelegraph has previously reported on the slow speed at which support tickets are resolved at Poloniex, with some users having waited over a month to have their tickets answered. Likewise, Poloniex���s sudden change to their Terms of Use resulted in alarm and consternation. Likewise, the Bitfinex exchange has been eyed recently due to its loss of banking, a certain trader (or traders) apparently manipulating the markets and the unusual situation surrounding their sister company���s Tether token. This is hardly a surprise, considering the exchange was hacked just last year. As the saying goes, ���once bitten, twice shy.��� Given these and other unfortunate events, it���s not surprising that users would become very worried when thousands of accounts are apparently frozen without notice and when Bittrex���s support team will not answer support tickets. The banning of users from Bittrex���s support Slack is perhaps the most alarming aspect of these reports. Even if a company is overwhelmed with support requests, banning customers from Slack seems highly unusual. We are still awaiting from Bittrex on our request for comment. If we receive a response, we will post an update.	0
American entrepreneur and vocal crypto advocate John McAfee has doubled down on his $1 million by 2020 prediction for Bitcoin (BTC). Taking stock of community sentiment in light of Bitcoin���s recent price fluctuations, McAfee wrote on July 15 that he was ���laughing his f------ ass off��� at the seemingly overblown negativity: ���Bitcoin is at the mid 10's and people worry. LMFAO!! Why do you pay attention to weekly fluctuations? Look at the past few months FFS! It's rising drastically. I'm still positive about my $1 mil BTC price by the end of 2020. Alt coins like MTC and Apollo will rise ten times more.��� As of press time, Bitcoin has indeed lost a round 9% on the week ��� almost 4% on the day ��� according to Cointelegraph���s Bitcoin Price Index, and is trading just north of $10,300.  Yet on the month, the coin���s chart shows a 23% gain ��� and caps a 100% gain over the three-month period to press time.  Bitcoin 3-month price chart. Source: Cointelegraph Bitcoin Price Index This summer, a Wall Street Journal report had revealed that the dizzying returns from Grayscale Investments��� Bitcoin Trust ��� which is up almost 300% on the year ��� had secured its spot as the best-performing fund in the market.  In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, McAfee predicted that 10 years from now, ���there'll be no fiat anywhere in the world [...] everything will be cryptocurrency.���  A passionate, anti-government crusader whose charisma has secured him a presumably welcome degree of notoriety, McAfee is currently in exile in Cuba., due to alleged U.S. income tax evasion charges ��� and is running his second campaign for the American presidency. Fellow Bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano ��� co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital Assets ��� recently predicted the coin would hit $100,000 by the end of 2021. In contrast to McAfee���s bullish view of alts like doc.com Token (MTC) and Apollo (APL), American broadcaster Max Keiser has predicted that the altcoin phenomenon is over and all value will flow into bitcoin in the latest crypto bull market. The stakes of McAfee���s forecast could not be higher: two years ago, he originally pledged to eat his dick on national television if Bitcoin didn���t hit $500,000 by 2020.

Yale economics professor and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller has admitted in an interview with CNBC Thursday, Jan. 18., that he now ���doesn���t know what to make of Bitcoin ultimately��� after earlier calling it ���the best example of a bubble���. In fresh comments Thursday, several months after he told host Brian Kelly it was Bitcoin���s ���story���  not its value that had sparked public interest in it, Shiller told reporters ���it [Bitcoin] has no value at all unless there is some common consensus that it has value. Other things like gold would at least have some value if people didn't see it as an investment,��� repeating a common narrative that investment in Bitcoin is like the 17th-century Tulip Mania. Though he admitted his uncertainty as to what Bitcoin���s fate will be, Shiller overall remains sceptical, stating: ���[Bitcoin] might totally collapse and be forgotten and I think that's a good likely outcome but it could linger on for a good long time, it could be here in 100 years.��� Bitcoin���s two-day slump this week has partially recovered to challenge $12,000, making it worth over 160 percent more than when Shiller made his previous bubble claims in early September, 2017.	2
Jan. 21 update: This article originally mistakenly claimed that the Metropolitan Bank put a halt on all wire transfers for cryptocurrency exchanges. According to a statement issued by the Metropolitan, there were no changes in its policy and the 'halt' was misreported by the media. We apologize for the confusion this article might have caused. Bitcoin exchanges are under fire in India, as many of the nation���s top banks have suspended or greatly curtailed functionality on exchange accounts. State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank have all taken strong action toward crypto exchanges, either closing accounts or severely limiting functionality. The banks cite the risk of dubious transactions, according to local reports. The news follows the request of advocate Bivas Chatterjee who recently filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Calcutta to impose immediate regulations on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance referred to Bitcoin as a ponzi scheme before the end of last year. The international mood toward Bitcoin has continued to tighten, particularly with US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin stating that the G20 nations will begin working together to make sure that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are properly regulated.	0
The Commodity Futures Trading Commision (CFTC) and US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) met the morning of February 6 2018 to discuss their roles in Blockchain, virtual currencies, and ICOs. Set in Washington D.C. at the Dirksen Senate Building, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs met in open session for about 2 hours. Before the hearing began, testimonies were released on behalf of both witnesses. (these testimonies were released on February 5 2018) J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman and witness of the CFTC, expressed optimism in his testimony towards Blockchain/DLT, dedicating a page and a half (VI. Potential Benefits) to the numerous ways financial institutions, charities, social services, agriculture, and logistics can all benefit from it. Giancarlo seemed very bullish on allowing more freedoms for DLT, even comparing it to the internet: ���This simple approach is well-recognized as the enlightened regulatory underpinning of the Internet that brought about such profound changes to human society. During the almost 20 years of ���do no harm��� regulation, a massive amount of investment was made in the Internet���s infrastructure. It yielded a rapid expansion in access that supported swift deployment and mass adoption of Internet-based technologies. Internet-based innovations have revolutionized nearly every aspect of American life, from telecommunications to commerce, transportation and research and development. [���Do] no harm��� was unquestionably the right approach to development of the Internet. Similarly, I believe that ���do no harm��� is the right overarching approach for distributed ledger technology. ��� Despite his optimism, the chairman still stated that digital currencies will ���likely require more attentive regulatory oversight��� in regards to ���fraud and manipulation.��� But in his conclusion, he addressed that the SEC and CFTC should do their best to leave room for growth: ���As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response.��� Jay Clayton, the chairman of the SEC, was a little less excited about virtual currencies - but he also wasn���t denying their role in a modern financial ecosystem. ���To be clear, I am very optimistic that developments in financial technology will help facilitate capital formation, providing promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike. From a financial regulatory perspective, these developments may enable us to better monitor transactions, holdings and obligations (including credit exposures) and other activities and characteristics of our markets, thereby facilitating our regulatory mission, including, importantly, investor protection.��� But he also admitted that there still lay many traps: ���At the same time, regardless of the promise of this technology, those who invest their hard-earned money in opportunities that fall within the scope of the federal securities laws deserve the full protections afforded under those laws. This ever-present need comes into focus when enthusiasm for obtaining a profitable piece of a new technology ���before it���s too late��� is strong and broad. Fraudsters and other bad actors prey on this enthusiasm.���  SEC Chairman Clayton and CFTC Chairman Giancarlo, image source: c-span While Giancarlo mentions the word ���ICO��� once in his testimony, Clayton mentions it 132 times. A recent study has found that 10% of all ICO proceeds have been lost to hacks and fraud, and Clayton���s fear is that many uneducated investors are losing lots of money. He even went on to promote Facebook���s recent ICO advertising ban: ���I do want to recognize that recently social media platforms have restricted the ability of users to promote ICOs and cryptocurrencies on their platforms. I appreciate the responsible step.��� Clayton goes on to praise the innovations of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), better known as ���Blockchain���, but hopeful to create some boundaries for ICOs. ���Simply said, we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and markets.��� Clayton has mentioned that he and Giancarlo have ���built a strong relationship.��� They are willing to work together to come up with a robust regulatory framework. In the simplest of terms, there seems to be a gradient that starts at ICOs, to virtual currencies, and then to DLT. DLT needs the least regulation, and in fact both the SEC and CTFC seem to encourage anyone willing to expand on it. ICOs are on the other side, requiring the most regulation, and virtual currencies are in the middle, needing protection against fraud and market manipulation. Today���s hearing was refreshing in the sense that both Chairman Giancarlo and Chairman Clayton remained excited about the potential of decentralized technology and cryptocurrencies throughout the hearing. Clayton broke it down into 3 categories: DLT (distributed ledger technology), cryptocurrencies, and ICOs. As stated in the pre-testimonies, the CTFC was interested in allowing growth for DLT and cryptocurrencies, while keeping a watchful eye on fraudsters in ICOs. Giancarlo was very bullish in his sentiments towards cryptocurrency. In his opening statement he said that ���we owe it to this generation to respect this generation's interest in cryptocurrencies, and punish those who persecute.��� He talked about how interested his children were in the Bitcoin world and it was exciting to see them so interested in finance. CFTC Chairman Giancarlo opens with a story of his 3 college-aged kids who are enthusiastic about #Crypto as most #millenials are. He advocated that we embrace #CryptoCurrency. Great stuff! We can thank his kids for that one. #PayWithLitecoin He also mentioned Lab CFC: the CFTC���s organization to educate Main Street on cryptocurrencies. Giancarlo stressed that education was the most important route to take when overseeing cryptocurrencies; the CFTC has never conducted as much educational outreach as they have in this area. Senator Crapo mentioned that neither agencies have complete jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies and ICOs. Giancarlo and Clayton both agreed that they ���may need additional authorities to regulate,��� but before they can agree to that they must learn more about the crypto space. Clayton also briefly touched on the issue that the SEC does not have enough money to hire more people. When Senator Cotton asked Giancarlo about the value of Bitcoin, Giancarlo replied with ���If there was no Bitcoin, there would be no DLT.��� Both Clayton and Giancarlo know that cryptocurrencies are important for the development of DLT, and want to see the technology grow without getting anyone hurt in the process. Giancarlo also said that Bitcoin���s floor could not be zero. This is because Bitcoin���s value is ���tied to mining.��� There wasn���t much talk at all about tax regulation. Clayton and Giancarlo also admitted that they have no jurisdiction over nation states, such as Venezuela, using cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions. Clayton did mention that while ETFs in Bitcoin are currently not ready, but that ���there will be room in the future.��� Lastly, Senator Warren asked Clayton how they can make ICOs safer. Clayton responded that many ICOs are, in fact, violating existing laws and that ICOs ���should pay more attention��� because the SEC is going to be investigating these violations further. The best solution, according to both Giancarlo and Clayton, would be to: Educate the masses about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies Use the jurisdiction that they have over the futures markets of Bitcoin to collect data and keep track of the markets so that nobody gets too hurt Use taskforce to go after ���fraudsters��� who are scamming Main Street investors in ICO pyramid schemes, and worthless cryptocurrencies. In summary, cryptocurrencies will allow growth for the United States the same way that the internet did. The United States should be a leader in this aspect, and make sure that nobody gets hurt in the process. Crypto HODL���ers alike all agree that the news was very bullish. On a side note, Giancarlo thinks ���HODL��� is an acronym for ���Hold On for Dear Life.��� Did Giancarlo just say HODL to a group of senators	1
Major Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading platforms within the global market have been adding more than 100,000 users per day. Many of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase (GDAX), Binance, Bittrex, Bitstamp and Kraken have struggled in dealing with the abrupt surge in demand for cryptocurrencies. Some exchanges have overhauled their systems to improve their scalability, while others have temporarily stopped opening new user accounts. This week, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, the global market���s largest cryptocurrency exchange with a staggering $9.5 bln daily trading volume, revealed that it has added more than 250,000 users on a single day. ���Sorry guys, servicing existing members is higher priority at this point. Full team working around the clock. Both tech and support. Just too much demand. Added 250,000 new users in the last 24 hours,��� said Zhao, referencing the official statement released by the company. On Jan. 4, Binance stated, ���due to the overwhelming surge in popularity, Binance will have to temporarily disable new user registrations to allow for an infrastructure upgrade. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.��� In December, both Kraken and Coinbase allocated a significant portion of their resources and capital in improving customer support and the scalability of their platforms. On Dec. 23, Kraken, which has found difficulty in processing account verifications, disclosed that it has implemented major system upgrades and improvements in performance and will continue to develop its trading platform to support new users. The Kraken development team admitted that its current infrastructure is ���degraded and unreliable,��� and vowed to improve it throughout January. The company said: ���We have made significant progress in the last week with the system upgrades and have realized moderate improvement in performance. Unfortunately, we were not able to complete all of the upgrades and the most impactful measures are yet to come. For the time being, systems should still be considered degraded and unreliable.��� Regional exchanges such as South Korea���s Bithumb, the world���s second largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of daily trading volume, have also stopped accepting new users. In late 2017, South Korea���s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange Korbit was acquired at a valuation of $140 mln by a $10 bln gaming giant in Nexon. Given the size and the market valuation of Korbit, major exchanges like Bithumb, Bitstamp, Kraken and Binance could be worth more than $1 bln, as Coinbase was valued at $1.6 bln in its latest funding round. Even with such large market valuation, high-profit margins, and many resources, cryptocurrency exchanges are struggling to address the exponentially increasing demand from investors because of the strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems the companies were forced to implement by the authorities. Each user application must be manually approved and verified. The failure to segregate fraudulent accounts from legitimate users could result in large fines and lawsuits for exchanges. Consequently, the vetting process of users is rigorous and requires significant efforts from the employees of exchanges. Given that exchanges are adding more than 100,000 users per day, it is likely that exchanges are also receiving more than one mln trading account approval requests per month, at least. That is, if the approval process of accounts take around 10 minutes per account, 166,666 hours on a monthly basis that employees have to cover manually. In the next few months, global cryptocurrency exchanges will make drastic changes to their systems. Until then, users, especially newcomers, will find it difficult to open approved trading accounts.	2
The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume, Binance, continues to see explosive growth in spite of price reductions across the market earlier this week. The company added 240,000 users in just one hour on Wednesday Jan. 10, surpassing all previous growth records. Binance���s record growth this week is taking place in spite of drops across the markets, and negative comments from traditional investment moguls like Warren Buffet. In response to Buffet���s pessimistic comments on the crypto market, Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng told Bloomberg in an interview Jan. 11: ���Warren Buffett is a guy I truly respect from an investment point of view. But I do not think he understands cryptocurrencies at all. It is what it is. I still respect him in other parts of his expertise. But I think on cryptocurrencies he���s making a big mistake.��� Zhao himself is even surprised by Binance���s growth, saying in the interview that the company had not expected the explosive numbers Wednesday. The company has hosted almost $5 bln in cryptocurrency trades in the past 24 hours to press time. The exchange temporarily closed new registrations last week while undergoing an update to allow for higher volumes, and has since re-opened them to limited numbers.   Other industry insiders see the Binance success as a general sign of growth in the market, and increasing adoption. Gregory Van den Bergh, co-founder and CEO of MiCai, a Blockchain based wealth management firm, told Cointelegraph: ���We are just at the early stage of the crypto adoption curve. Binance and other crypto exchanges are still serving the crypto early adopters. The next phase of adoption will come from the  30 tln dollars that is currently actively managed on behalf of high net worth individuals across the globe.��� Bitcoin continues trading lower on the day, however. At press time, the average price among exchanges was $14,123, up almost four percent on the day.	2
Stricter regulations for South Korea���s cryptocurrency trading industry were announced Sunday, Jan. 14, amidst continued confusion in mainstream media about a proposed ban on cryptocurrency trading by the country���s Justice Minister last week. Reports in local news agency Yonhap claimed Sunday, Jan. 14, that requirements for Korean traders to use their real names for cryptocurrency trading accounts, a potential regulation reported earlier in January, will indeed come into effect by the end of this month, citing ���the authorities.��� Yonhap reports that fines will also be imposed for those who do not comply with the new regulations, though the fine amount has yet to be determined. Yonhap quotes today���s government statement as saying: ���The proposed shutdown of exchanges that the justice minister recently mentioned is one of the measures suggested by the justice ministry to curb speculation. A governmentwide decision will be made in the future after sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions.��� The publication added: ���Monday's announcement suggests that a shutdown is not likely in the near future.��� The turbulent regulatory landscape in South Korea has resulted in fragmented information appearing on a daily basis as to how cryptocurrency will ultimately fare under Seoul���s jurisdiction. In the latest news from Monday, Jan. 15, an official statement from the Office for Government Policy Coordination was released stating that a ban on cryptocurrency is not in the works and that the government has yet to come to a final decision. On Jan. 11, Justice Minister Park Sang-ki proposed banning crypto trading in a press conference. The subsequent misinterpretation of his comments in mainstream media caused confusion on social media, which was repeatedly corrected by local correspondents and traders on Twitter. Nevertheless, the FUD -- Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt -- caused by the Minister���s comments and the misleading reporting on them evidently led to a cryptocurrency sell-off that same day. Public sentiment on the ground suggests a genuine consensus to keep trading open and accessible, with last week���s petition to reject a ban on cryptocurrency trading gathering over 150,000 signatures by press time. If the petition reaches 200,000 signatures by Jan. 27, it will compel a government response, the Wall Street Journal reports.	0
The year of 2017 was a fantastic year for some Bitcoin users, but others were not so lucky with the cryptocurrency. Below, we���ll look at some of the most impressive success stories of the year, as well as the profiles of people who probably wish they���d never touched Bitcoin at all. It���s a highly erratic currency, but people who invested in it before its recent prominence often found their foresight was lucrative in ways they never imagined at first. One anonymous person who posted a detailed story on Steemit said that in 2010, the price of each Bitcoin was so low that it was not even valuable enough to buy a pizza. Still, by the end of that year, the person reportedly had 12,000 Bitcoins and collecting the large number of them paid off. That���s because by April 2013, the worth of each Bitcoin had ballooned to over $100. Due to some issues in the individual���s personal life and a few other non-Bitcoin-related factors, the person took a couple of breaks from Bitcoin but was never completely out of the loop with them. Eventually, this anonymous Bitcoin user heard that the 12,000 Bitcoins were now worth over $10 mln. Despite that fortunate turn of events, the person only began selling them in small quantities so as to not attract attention. The individual also planned for the future by choosing investment strategies and did not let the rapid wealth impact their employment. As words of advice, the person suggests exercising patience and not getting greedy, while also keeping up on newsworthy events. Erik Fineman began investing in Bitcoins in 2011 when he was only 11 after his grandmother gave him $1,000 and his brother offered him a tip about what to do with the money. In those early days, Bitcoins were only worth $12 each. However, when Fineman sold his first Bitcoins at the end of 2013, each one had a value of $1,200. By then, Fineman had turned the $1,000 from his grandma into $100,000 and used it to start an online education company in 2014. He hadn���t had a pleasant experience in high school and thought that his new business venture could connect frustrated students and willing teachers over video chat. Fineman also moved to Silicon Valley, traveled the world and made a bet with his parents that if he were a millionaire by age 18, he���d not have to go to college. In January 2015, Fineman sold his education company and was given the choice of accepting  $100,000 or 300 Bitcoins. He took the Bitcoins. Fineman also achieved his goal of becoming an 18-year-old millionaire and won���t be going to college. He says he���s happy learning from real-world experiences. However, Fineman stays busy with numerous projects, including involvement with NASA. Those activities ��� and savvy business sense ��� feasibly helped him get where he is today. Jeremy Gardner is another person who boldly began investing in Bitcoin during the early days ��� notice a pattern here? ��� and received a substantial payoff. In 2013, one of Gardner���s friends got him some Bitcoins in exchange for cash and Gardener began feeling fascinated about how he could work with the currency with nothing more than an Internet connection. He also loved how there was no centralized regulatory body for Bitcoin.   As Gardener became immersed in the Bitcoin world, he became a strong and emphatic voice in the cryptocurrency world, often using social media as a platform. He also wisely invested money into starting and supporting companies associated with Bitcoins and Blockchain technology. Gardner stops short of disclosing how much money he���s made by investing in Bitcoin technologies, but is referred to as a ���self-made millionaire.��� Plus, he keeps a realistic perspective and understands that whenever the value of Bitcoins goes up rapidly, it���ll likely also go in the other direction soon. However, Gardener has a broad network of investments. Those interests are arguably helping protect his worth and allow him to get financial benefits from numerous sources. Traveling the world is something many people dream of doing, but Mr. Smith has turned that aspiration into reality, all due to Bitcoin investments starting in 2010. A man with a college education and former Silicon Valley employee, Mr. Smith, heard about Bitcoins in July of 2010 and began investing in them a few months later. Knowing he was in it for the long haul, Smith put his Bitcoin investments on the backburner until 2013, a time when the cryptocurrency���s value started rising rapidly. Eventually, the price per coin went up to more than 2,000 times what Smith originally paid for it. He now claims to have made $25 million from an initial $3,000 investment and uses the money to go on lavish, round-the-world travels that involve only staying in five-star hotels and flying first-class. Smith still owns 1,000 Bitcoins, but only wants to sell those once the per-coin value reaches $150,000. He has no regrets about selling the rest and says he has everything he ever wanted, thanks to Bitcoins. Tim Enneking is a prime example of how to succeed in Bitcoin investing. He���s a hedge fund manager who achieved the all-time annual records for both funds and funds of funds. Enneking was skeptical of digital currencies, although he started running the world���s first digital currency fund. During his work, Enneking decided to rigorously research Bitcoins. After realizing he didn���t find any red flags, he concluded perhaps there was more to the cryptocurrency than he���d originally thought and started looking for ways to become more heavily involved in funds management. Enneking now has experience overseeing funds within the US and abroad. He advocates being cautious while investing and taking time to understand market trends. Furthermore, Enneking reminds potential investors that due to the rapid fluctuations of digital currencies, it may take time to see investments become fruitful. You might not have heard of 26-year-old Olaf-Carlson Wee before, but he���s another person who recognized the potential of Bitcoins before many other people and got rich as a result. In February 2013, at a time when a single Bitcoin���s worth was between $20-30, Carson Wee began working for a Bitcoin startup called Coinbase. At that time, Bitcoins were not part of the cultural consciousness yet, and the mere mention of them caused raised eyebrows if people were aware of them at all. However, Carlson Wee viewed Bitcoins as a promising currency. He made an arrangement with his employer to only get paid with them instead of physical money and started making transactions with Bitcoins whenever possible. Those decisions were ultimately profitable because they made Carlson Wee a millionaire. The success stories you just read might be enough to make you want to start investing in Bitcoins immediately. But, if there���s a consistent thread in all those outstanding stories, it���s that the Bitcoin value changes without warning. However, some people have unfortunate circumstances related to Bitcoins that aren't always about their falling value. You���ll see some examples below.   James Howells, a 32-year-old man from Wales, started working with Bitcoins from a computer in 2009. A year later, he disassembled the device and stored the parts in a drawer, then eventually threw them away. Because several years��� worth of trash now lie on top of the valuable but discarded hard drive, retrieving it is an expensive process, and the condition of the hard drive is unknown. However, the reason why the ramifications of this failure became especially evident this year is that estimates suggest the hard drive and the Bitcoins it contains are worth more than $100 mln at today���s prices.   Howells keeps an upbeat attitude about his lost fortune and knows there���s no point in getting too upset about it. If he ever does recover it, however, he���ll buy a Lamborghini. Despite how things turned out for Howells, he hasn���t given up on cryptocurrencies. He���s still active with them today and puts his energies into one called Bitcoin Cash. Most people have gone through the frustration of forgetting passwords and PINs, but they probably don���t have to deal with the aftermath of losing the equivalent of $30,000 because of the blunder. However, Mark Frauenfelder invested $3,000 in Bitcoins last year and had numerous profitable ventures afterward. He talked to Bitcoin experts who told him that using a hardware wallet was the best way to protect his Bitcoin cache, so Frauenfelder bought one in November 2016 for $100. While setting up the hardware wallet, he had to set up a PIN, along with a 24-word list used to recover access if needed. Frauenfelder wrote down the words on a piece of paper. Unfortunately, a cleaning company employee threw the document away. Frauenfelder didn���t think that was a big deal at first until he discovered he���d forgotten his PIN. Desperate to regain access, he went online and posted on forums, plus contacted customer service representatives associated with the hardware wallet manufacturer. Frauenfelder even visited a hypnotist this spring, but the session did not bring about successful results. At long last, he got help from someone who helped him hack into the hardware wallet and get the PIN and 24-word list. But, not without substantial heartache, stress and paying money for retrieval methods. The anonymous nature of Bitcoin may compel people to use the currency for illegal things. However, as a 58-year-old Italian woman who lives in Denmark learned, doing that can cause trouble. She hired a hitman to carry out a failed murder plot related to her boyfriend and used Bitcoin to pay for it. A court ruling resulted in a six-year jail term. It also caused her to lose residence privileges in Denmark, where she���s lived for 30 years. Cody Brown, a startup executive, saw first hand how bad things could get during a Bitcoin theft. He lost $8,000 worth of Bitcoins in 15 minutes after a hacker got into his Verizon account, which was connected with Coinbase. Brown believed he got targeted because of a tweet he���d RT���d from a friend who���d also been hacked earlier. Brown is not hopeful of ever getting the stolen cryptocurrency back. However, he���s also not giving up on Bitcoins. Brown believes that the companies involved in it will eventually figure out how to lock their systems down tighter and potentially add more fraud protection resources for customers. Simon first used the TOR network in 2011. He stumbled upon one of those shady online marketplaces that offered all kinds of illegal things, ��� guns, drugs, counterfeit documents, you name it. As a teenager, Simon decided that getting a brand new passport for a certain European country would be a neat thing to do. The price tag was 10,000 BTC. If he threw in an extra 6,000 BTC, the seller promised to get Simon a press ID from an esteemed newspaper, too. He couldn���t resist. Simon transferred his funds to a crypto-exchange platform but, when it came time for the merchant to deliver, the merchant disappeared. ���Maybe he got arrested?��� Simon wondered to himself.  He was confused, but he still had his money safely tucked away in the exchange account since the seller had vanished. All was okay as far as he was concerned. Two years later, newspapers began reporting the arrest of a Russian man accused of money laundering. The name of the laundering service he had controlled was Liberty Finance, which Simon instantly recognized as the crypto-exchange platform he had used to keep his 20,000 BTC. In light of the scandal, the FBI seized control of the exchange platform and all money associated with it. Simon kissed that money goodbye long ago, but it doesn���t make it easier for him to see how Bitcoin has appreciated over time. If Liberty Finance hadn���t been a money laundering scam, Simon would have acquired some $400 mln dollars. Despite the lack of regulation in the Bitcoin world, entities that are breaking the law still get caught. Case in point? BTC-e, a long-running Bitcoin exchange. It received a $110 mln fine from the Federal Trade Commission for alleged money laundering. Also, Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man associated with the exchange got arrested and faces over five decades in prison if convicted. Another recent incidence of alleged questionable behavior from Russia comes from Anatoly Kaplan, the owner of ForkLog, a Russian cryptocurrency news outlet. According to reports, the Ukrainian Secret Service is investigating Kaplan in connection with alleged associations with Americans involved in unlawful activities. The Ukrainian authorities searched Kaplan���s apartment and confiscated his laptop. Also, this is not the first time ForkLog has come to the attention of law enforcement officials. Kaplan maintains his innocence and asserts his site does not have technology capable of the things the Ukrainian police accuse him of doing. Kaplan also says during the search and seizure related to the investigation, one of the Ukrainians tried to transfer some of Kaplan���s Bitcoins. Kaplan and his attorney plan to take legal action and are confident about a positive outcome, but even so, this event has already caused stress and unfavorable publicity for Kaplan and his ForkLog site. These tales of wonder and woe prove that Bitcoin investments are not for the faint of heart. The people who engage in them must be ready for ruin, but they might become amazingly prosperous instead.	1
Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA), the embattled cryptocurrency project that has forked away from both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, has rebranded to eCash (XEC). The project���s re-launch will see it integrate proof-of-stake consensus layer ���Avalanche,��� introducing staking and greatly increasing the speed of transactions. eCash will also reduce its decimal places down from eight to two, with lead developer, Amaury Sechet, stating: With the upgrade, all users��� BCHA coins will be converted to XEC at a ration of one-to-one million. Chinese crypto media, Wu Blockchain, noted the project plans to support EVM-compatibility, signalling eCash hopes to interoperate with Ethereum���s burgeoning DeFi sector. Bitcoin ABC proponent, Joannes Vermorel, articulated five core missions for the project ��� ensuring transactions are anonymous, immutable, low cost, and secure in less than three seconds, and maintaining infrastructure as ���a public good funded through the coin social contract.��� Bitcoin Cash ABC experienced a rocky ride after emerging as the minority chain after November 2020���s Bitcoin Cash fork.  The rest of the community did not accept Sechet���s move to redistribute 8% of newly mined coins to a wallet under his control to fund development. This was implemented into ABC in November. According to CoinmarketCap, Bitcoin Cash is currently the 12th-largest crypto asset with a capitalization of $9.2 billion, while Bitcoin Cash ABC ranks 217th with a market cap of $587 million.	1
An Indonesian college student has reportedly become a millionaire by selling nonfungible token (NFT) versions of his selfies on the OpenSea NFT marketplace. Sultan Gustaf Al Ghozali, a 22-year-old computer science student from Semarang, Indonesia, converted and sold nearly 1,000 selfie images as NFTs. According to Ghozali, he took photos of himself for five years ��� between the ages of 18 and 22 ��� as a way to look back on his graduation journey. Uploading my photo into nft lolhttps://t.co/E3Q4sBmN26#NFT #opensea pic.twitter.com/rD51rdcpzp Ghozali took selfies, either sitting or standing in front of his computer, which were later converted into NFTs and uploaded to OpenSea in December 2021. The artist set the price for each NFT selfie at $3 without expecting interest from serious buyers. While monetizing his expressionless images, Ghozali said: Going against his wildest expectations, Ghozali���s NFT offering blew up as prominent members of Crypto Twitter showed support by purchasing and marketing the offerings. Ghozali happened...the year of Gozali @Ghozali_Ghozalu pic.twitter.com/HKOw7FZddj With the rising popularity, one of Ghozali���s NFT sold for 0.247 Ether (ETH) on Friday worth $806 at the time of purchase, according to AFP. The young entrepreneur also added a touch of personalization by providing some background information along with the selfies, which adds to the rarity of the NFT. every #NFT photo I take has a story behindThis photo was taken during the second corona vaccine https://t.co/pZfJKoKuc9 Some of Ghozali���s selfie NFTs sold for 0.9 ETH, worth roughly $3,000, according to a Lifestyle Asia report. Ghozali���s collection subsequently reached a total trade volume of 317 ETH, equivalent to more than $1 million. The young artist also made his first tax payment on the basis of this income through OpenSea. this is my first tax payment in my life https://t.co/VDa8KYYPGs Despite the recent sluggish performance of the overall crypto market, the NFT marketplace and blockchain gaming industry continues to record high transaction volumes.  As Cointelegraph reported, DappRadar data shows that the number of unique active wallets connected to Ethereum NFT decentralized applications grew by 43% since Q3 2021. In addition, the money generated by NFT trading went from $10.7 billion in Q3 2021 to $11.9 billion in the first 10 days of 2022.	1
Mark Cuban, billionaire tech investor and owner of the NBA team The Dallas Mavericks tweeted on Tuesday, Jan. 16 that starting next season, it will be possible to buy tickets to the team's games with Bitcoin. The Dallas Mavericks won���t be the first basketball team to start accepting Bitcoin as payment for tickets. The Sacramento Kings officially started accepting Bitcoin for promotional products as well as for tickets as far back as 2014. Cuban is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry. He is famous for not only investing in a digital currency hedge fund and an ICO but also launching the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency Mercury Protocol in August 2017. Cuban���s view on cryptocurrency and Blockchain has changed multiple times over the course of 2017 -- he joined the voices calling the world���s leading virtual currency ���a bubble��� in June, but by October was claiming cryptocurrencies and Blockchain are the future. In addition, Cuban included a tip to invest 10% of your life savings in Bitcoin in his video guide on ���how to get rich���. ���If you���re a true adventurer and you really want to throw the Hail Mary, you might take 10 percent and put it in Bitcoin or Ethereum,��� Cuban noted in the video. While the cryptocurrency market is undergoing a difficult period, the fact that billionaire investors like Cuban, Thiel and Zuckerberg recognize the prospects of Bitcoin is a sign of potential future growth.	2
A recent paper on Bitcoin (BTC) price manipulation has shown that just one actor was likely responsible for driving the price of Bitcoin from $150 to $1000 in 2013. The paper, co-authored by Neil Gandal, JT Hamrick, Tyler Moore, and Tali Oberman, examines the suspicious trading activity that took place on the now-defunct Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange, and claims that it correlated with the sharp increase of the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013: ���The USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity.��� The suspicious activity mostly consisted of two bots, Markus and Willy, which used bitcoins that they didn���t own to perform what appeared to be valid trades. These fraudulent transactions were included in the overall trading volume by the Mt. Gox exchange, showing a higher than normal amount of trading activity and thus prompting the public to begin trading legitimately. The paper postulates that the use of the Willy bot and its trades were additionally used to cover up an earlier hack at Mt. Gox: ���A theory, initially espoused in a Reddit post shortly after Mt. Gox���s collapse (Anonymous, 2014b), is that hackers stole a huge number (approximately 650,000) of bitcoins from Mt. Gox in June 2011 and that the exchange owner Mark [Karpeles] took extraordinary steps to cover up the loss for several years.��� The price manipulation that occured in the early Bitcoin crypto market, and the possibility for it to happen now as well, is due to the relatively thin market for cryptocurrencies that leaves them vulnerable to high price fluctuations. Chairperson Jay Clayton of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave a speech in November, warning about the high potential for price manipulation in the market for initial coin offerings (ICO). Back in August 2017, Cointelegraph reported about an anonymous actor, known as Spoofy, who has been manipulating the Bitcoin markets by ���spoofing��� (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before the execution) large amounts of bitcoins. Spoofy, who also engaged in wash trading, or buying and selling to himself, has been successfully manipulating prices mainly on the Bitfinex exchange, which in turn influences the whole market due to how thinly cryptocurrencies are traded.	0
Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped from $10,000 to $8,100 within just over a day as it plunged by 9% in a single hour. It liquidated $200 million worth of longs, obliterating the futures market. The three key reasons that triggered the immense Bitcoin correction were: strong multi-year resistance area above $10,000, whales moving to short the market on BitMEX, and extreme volatility heading into the halving. Since mid-2018, the $10,200 to $10,500 range served as a historically strong area of resistance for the top-ranking cryptocurrency by market capitalization. After its first breakout above $10,500 in June 2019, which led to a swift run to $14,000, Bitcoin failed to move above that level five out of six times in the last two years.  Bitcoin rejects $10,000 ahead of halving. Source: Tradingview When the Bitcoin price initially broke down at $10,100 on May 8, it signaled the rejection of a key resistance level and left BTC vulnerable to a steep correction. As whales started to sell at $9,900, it led to a cascade of long contract liquidations primarily on BitMEX and Binance Futures. In one hour, more than $200 million worth of longs were liquidated. Almost as soon as the rejection of $10,200 was confirmed, whales started to fiercely short Bitcoin across major cryptocurrency exchanges. The open interest on the big four derivatives exchanges that include Binance Futures, BitMEX, Deribit and OKEx plunged. The term open interest refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open at a given time.  Open interest of BitMEX Bitcoin futures contract. Source: Hsaka The rapid decline in open interest meant that as selling pressure began to build up, it caused over-leveraged buyers in the futures market to get trapped in their positions. The funding rate on Bybit, Binance Futures and BitMEX remained at around -0.05%. A negative funding rate when the price of BTC is going down means that the overwhelming majority of the market is holding short contracts, expecting BTC to drop further. In other words, many traders, especially whales, betting against BTC at a critical reversal point of a long-term trend triggered a sharp drop in a short period of time. Ahead of the Bitcoin block reward halving set to occur on May 12, trading activity on all major cryptocurrency platforms surged significantly. CME saw record-high open interest, Deribit recorded all-time high volume for its options contracts, and spot exchanges demonstrated 2017-esque volume in the last three weeks. When many new investors enter the market in anticipation of a major event, it opens the market up for a steep selloff. For instance, after the 2016 block reward halving, the Bitcoin price dropped by more than 30%, as traders reacted with a sell-the-news response. A confluence of an over-extended Bitcoin rally to $10,000, whales front-running retail investors with a sharp sell-off at $9,900, and high anticipation for the halving are triggering a near-term pullback prior to the May 12 Bitcoin halving.	0
Bitcoin has officially hit the $9,000 mark today, as the massive user adoption from hedge funds, soon-to-be-released futures markets and further increases in the number of users. Ironically, many on the /r/BitcoinMarkets subreddit expected the price to drop over the Thanksgiving weekend, in part due to US banks being closed. However, over the past week the price had shown strength, consolidating in the low $8,000s. Twice the price briefly dipped into the $7,800 range, but those dips were rapidly bought. Apparently people didn���t merely take advantage of Black Friday to buy TVs and electronics, but also stocked up on Bitcoin. The price began trending up yesterday as the market began adding volume, and today broke the next major psychological hurdle of $9,000. Thought many mainstream finance pundits regard Bitcoin as a bubble, the market has not shown any signs of a so-called ���blow off top,��� meaning a sudden and major reversal is unlikely at the moment. Bubble cycles often end with a massive spike in prices that���s almost immediately followed by an even larger sell-off. The next major hurdle, and arguably the largest psychological barrier of all, is $10,000. However, that may not be as hard to breach as one might think, considering that the combined price of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash already well exceeds $10,000. That is to say, anybody who owned Bitcoin prior to August 1 and didn���t sell their Bitcoin Cash is already enjoying prices in excess of the next major target. Analysts such as the normally bearish Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, are turning bullish. Lee recently indicated that his near term price projection is $14,000. He explains away the brief dip that followed the cancellation of SegWit2x as a shaking out of weak hands. At press time, Bitcoin���s price on the GDAX exchange was $9,085.	2
Sunday, June 10: crypto markets have seen a sharp drop today, in the wake of the news that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched a probe into four major crypto exchanges. All of the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in the red over the 24 hours to press time, while total market capitalization is down by about $20 bln over the same period, according to Coinmarketcap.  Market visualization from Coin360 Bitcoin (BTC) has lost just shy of 5 percent of its value in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $7,244. The majority of the decline took place over a period of just 2 hours, earlier today.  Bitcoin price chart.

Source: Coinmarketcap Among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, IOTA (MIOTA) and EOS have suffered the largest losses over the past 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap. MIOTA is down 10 percent, trading at $1.50. EOS, which saw significant growth earlier this month, coinciding with the release of its EOSIO 1.0 software stack, has not been spared today either, losing 8 percent over the 24 hour period. It is now trading at $13.12. The sharp decline in cryptocurrencies��� prices takes place in the wake of the news that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has requested trading data from crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. These are respectively the 21st, 14th, 45th and 13th largest exchanges in the world by trade volume, according to Coinmarketcap. Following the launch of Bitcoin futures trading by CME Group in December 2017, the four exchanges subpoenaed by the CFTC, have been providing price data for CME Group. The CFTC���s request is a part of an investigation into whether there is any activity taking place on these platforms that might constitute crypto price manipulation. Bloomberg reported today that a South Korean crypto exchange Coinrail is reviewing its systems after a suspected hacking attempt. Coinrail has reportedly claimed that it managed to freeze the affected NPXS, NPER and ATX coins. However, this event is unlikely to have significantly impacted the price action on the markets, with Coinmarketcap data showing that Coinrail is the 99th largest crypto exchange, with a trading volume of ���just��� about $2,5 mln. Entrepreneur and Bitcoin evangelist Alistair Milne tweeted a poll today, asking his followers what is the reason for the crypto markets��� sharp drop. Milne���s seeming implication that the fall is not related to either the CFTC���s data request or the Coinrail hack was met with approval by the crypto community, with ���Aliens��� being by far the most popular version, followed by ���Crypto iz ded.���	0
Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence predict that Bitcoin (BTC) ���has further to fall,��� Bloomberg reported Nov. 16. ���Bitcoin���s no longer boring��� declares Bloomberg, before stating that analysts predict the price could fall as low as the $1,500 point, a further 70 percent drop in the coin���s price. Bloomberg cites hedge fund founder Travis Kling saying that he ���didn���t sleep well��� because of the potential turmoil in wider crypto markets due to the recent Bitcoin Cash hard fork: ���There���s a small chance that, it���s difficult to estimate, that something really bad could happen related to Bitcoin Cash that could then impact the entire crypto market.��� Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone continued the argument, saying the recent market crash ���was sparked by the pump for the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.��� As Bloomberg reports, he explains that the ���pump that began a few weeks ago, got the market a bit too offsides with speculative longs playing for the good-old days. But this is an enduring bear market.��� The bear market in the cryptocurrency industry has evidently affected more than just prices. Major U.S.-based GPU manufacturer Nvidia recently reported a notable decrease in sales in the current quarter, citing fewer GPU sales specifically used for cryptocurrency mining. In a recent note to clients, Fundstrat Global Advisors analyst Rob Sluymer predicted that it will take ���weeks, if not months��� for Bitcoin to rebound from the ���technical damage��� caused by the recent price collapse. In a separate note this week, Fundstrat co-founder and Head of Research Tom Lee told clients that he was lowering his previous end-year target for Bitcoin���s price from $25,000 to $15,000.	0
The cryptocurrency ecosystem is agog with Bitcoin price so much that events happening around the underlying technology are forced to take a back seat from the eyes of the public. This, however, does not take anything away from the plenty technological inputs going on in the background with Bitcoin, Blockchain and the entire crypto ecosystem. For instance, due to the amount of its user base, miner base and network size, Bitcoin is a very secure yet isn't very adaptable to market's needs. This is where smaller scale cryptocurrency such as PIVX, Litecoin and Dash come in where they are able to innovate and improve its underlying technology utilizing the different block consensus and governance system. This allows adding of new Blockchain technology without guesswork if its users will support the change. Simply put, such developments allow people to experience new technology earlier while the developers are able to gain new knowledge and data sooner rather than later thus helping the overall growth and development of Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrencies. The meteoric rise of Bitcoin's fiat value is doing what it took geeks more than 20 years to accomplish: convince regular people that there was something worth looking at in this new experiment of creating, storing and safely transact digital value. Recently, we have even heard about people taking out mortgages to invest in cryptocurrency.  A lot of the new market participants only need a few pieces of information to engage - In fact, with little knowledge about the underlying technology, exchanges like Coinbase make it easy to get started with their simple and friendly user interface, a limited number of coins supported and the ability to integrate payments for your crypto with familiar western banking tools (i.e. checking accounts and credit cards). "2017 will be known as the year of the Bitcoin forks.��� Jason Cassidy, president of Blockchain TV There are dozens of these forks, which bring varying degrees of change and value to the space. If a fork (which is for all intents and purposes a copy) brings little value to the ecosystem, it is often generally disregarded. However, not all forks are created equal. A very small percentage of these forks come into existence due to real needs in the industry, regardless of whether the entire community shares that view. These forks often give a 1:1 matching to the Bitcoin you hold at the time of the event. If timed correctly, one can make a decent amount of wealth from simply holding a Bitcoin. Understanding what each fork brings and if there is any long-term, inherent value is a question that requires due diligence on behalf of the investor. On the other hand, the CEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel believes that most forks end up serving as a gateway into Bitcoin for investors and a fantastic way for new ideas and features to be tested and later implemented in the "mainstream" Bitcoin. ���The irony is that many forks and altcoins have no real substance from a function perspective. And although a lot of alts have had meteoric price increases (even greater than Bitcoin on a percentage basis this year), investors ultimately realize that Bitcoin already has the infrastructure and user base that other coins don't yet have,��� says Vogel. Therefore, the dominant pattern sees users entering into the ecosystem by converting their fiat currencies first into Bitcoin in most cases via the exchanges. This enables them to purchase the tokens that are usually on sale during the ICOs of these forks, and most often after the ICOs they head right back to Bitcoin whose value has been sustained over time. Blockchain Evangelist, Melvin Petties explains that limited intelligence of the underlying protocol fundamentals, dynamics and nuance make cryptocurrency speculation for everyday folks a more risky endeavor than they may be aware of.     ���I doubt if the "new money" in the game can talk at length about inherent risks or present/potential uses cases of these new asset management systems as a supporting argument  for the positions they have taken.��� Human beings are wired to try to make sense of new phenomena by processing all the information of the past.  Sometimes that can bite in the rear as may assume similarities where there are none.  As such, it helps to assimilate any new or additional information in the context to help make more sense of it in comparison to other experiences. For example, imagine your buddy invites you to "catch some waves" and to your surprise, after two hours on the road you finally pull up to an indoor resort water park where they have one of those cool new "wave pools;" the waves are generated mechanically and are meant to impress, but not utterly frighten well-meaning vacationers. This is not the same as a trip to the beach right. The same can be said of traditional investment vehicles vs. cryptocurrencies and assets.  Some key interactions with each are very familiar; however, the context of operating within a purely virtual universe where the data is publicly distributed and infrastructure is community owned is very important to how you choose to engage. Anyone might want to know some of the machinations and nuances that make HODLing and transacting in this new medium different from the traditional experience that they are used to.  Let���s identify some of the ideas that could raise some eyebrows: The point of these considerations is not to scare people away from using or investing in cryptocurrency, but to better illuminate the context of this new environment and how it differs from our closed network design today. Hopefully, this perspective encourages investors to weigh the pros and cons of each coin they buy and judge the overall utility and value by present and future context. One of the important inventions that we take for granted as society is the rule-of-law - a common and agreed understanding/ social construct for the proper/expected behaviors and consequences for various interactions between humans and the things they make. To be perfectly clear, we are just scratching the surface on how to do this in a coherent, dynamic, and flexible way as it relates to globally operated asset management systems.  Rules for a Flat World dives into some of the challenges and opportunities we face in getting there, but take a look at some of the cool rules we have created regarding data privacy and the stewardship of information managed by private institutions today: None of these constructs have a way of being expressed just yet, but folks are working on the problem and some really fun and interesting business models will be built to fill the gap. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay and we need a new governance mechanism to help us cope with the inevitable mistakes and hacks that will occur. Most cryptocurrency platforms and projects could fall into one of two buckets: currency and non-currency. Of course some protocols like Ethereum straddle the fence, but in general this rule is pretty sound. Humans are always doing work on something, whether that's serving each other or entertaining ourselves. At the end of the day, lots of developers and entrepreneurs decided to go the "non-currency" direction as they explore Blockchain technology for other purposes. On the currency side, you have projects that form out of dissent with existing implementations (known commonly as forks) or projects that are built from the ground up to address shortcomings they discovered in predecessors. Bitcoin is and will continue to be the leading cryptocurrency but alternative cryptocurrencies through continuous innovation fuel the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. For example, the PIVX combined proof of stake with the zerocoin protocol provides a case study for Bitcoins development and also opens up other avenues of entry for users who may want more privacy. Other innovations that have been forked off the Bitcoin protocol with the specific offerings to the ecosystem include Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Classic, among others. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum is a classic study of currency vs. non-currency.  Just look at how they each describe themselves: Again, the point is to highlight how better information and the idea of context can go a long way to shape decisions about investing. Everyone who endeavors to create and support a cryptocurrency or Blockchain project is effectively raising the collective consciousness of the community.  Therefore, users and investors are expected to give great feedback through their actions by evaluating them more on their merits.	2
The price of cryptocurrency IOTA has retreated to below  $4.20 per token as of press time, after breaching the $5 level to an intraday high of $5.03 during yesterday���s trading session. The drop follows the recent clarification that IOTA���s collaboration with Microsoft is not an official partnership. The so-called ���IOT cryptocurrency��� failed to sustain its momentum from earlier this month and has been overtaken by Litecoin, now the fifth largest virtual currency by market capitalization. Litecoin considered the crypto market���s silver to Bitcoin Gold, boasts a nearly $4 bln trading volume in the past 24 hours. The digital currency is trading at around $300 as of press time. IOTA, meanwhile, has registered a 10 percent price loss on a trading volume of just slightly below $500 mln over the same period. More than 40 percent of the IOTA transactions were conducted on the platform Bitfinex, which was the first major virtual currency exchange to support the IOT cryptocurrency. The other key IOTA trading platforms are Chinese exchange Binance, which accounted for around 25 percent of the total volume traded, and South Korea���s number two cryptocurrency exchange Coinone, which conducted 12-14 percent of the total transactions. The IOT cryptocurrency has also registered a major rally of its own just recently. In just over a week, IOTA���s price increased by about 450 percent after the announcement of its Data Marketplace, which misleadingly seemed to indicate a partnership with Microsoft. The reaction to this news resulted in a new record price peak of $5.55 on Dec. 6th.	0
Laszlo Hanyecz, the man that completed the world���s first documented Bitcoin (BTC) transaction for a physical item in 2010 -- 10,000 BTC for two pizzas -- has now bought two more pizzas using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Hanyecz posted on the Lightning-dev mailing list today, Feb. 25, that he had to get his friend in London to ���sub contract��� out the pizza delivery to a local pizza place in order to pay on the Lightning Network, because ���pizza/bitcoin atomic swap software��� is yet unavailable. However, according to Hanyecz, the transaction still ���demonstrates the basic premise of how this works for everyday transactions. It could just as well be the pizza shop accepting the payment directly with their own lightning node.��� The original BTC-pizza transaction took place on May 22, 2010 and has been celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day ever since. There is a Twitter feed dedicated to a daily posting of what 10,000 BTC equals according to that day���s market value -- today���s value is tweeted as $97,560,750. This time around Hanyecz paid 649000 satoshis, or 0.00649 bitcoins, which equals around $62 for both pizzas. In order to receive the pizza, Hanyecz decided that the best way to prove he had paid for it was to show the driver the first and last four characters of the hex string of his Lightning payment hash preimage, and if it matched with what the driver had, he would get his pizza. Hanyecz posits the pizzas as prizes to be received only if the lightning transaction can be done successfully, writing that if he couldn���t show the driver the pre-image, ���the pizza would not be handed over and it would be destroyed.��� The trial was a success, Hanyecz got his pizzas, but he added that ���it's probably not a good practice to share the preimage.��� Hanyecz included a link in his post to several photos of him and his family enjoying the pizzas, one kid wearing an ���I love pizza��� shirt, the other in an ���I love Bitcoin��� one, and the notepad with the partial preimage displayed in front of the pizza box:  The first ever documented physical purchase on the Lightning Network, a ���second layer��� payment protocol considered the next step in BTC���s evolution by increasing the capacity of the network for a global audience, reportedly took place on Jan. 20 of this year. Reddit user /u/btc_throwaway1337 posted that he bought a VPN Router through a payment channel provided by TorGuard, a purchase comparable in significance to the original Pizza day. Hanyecz ends the post about his successful lightning BTC-pizza transaction by asking his readers, ���So is there any point to doing this instead of an on chain transaction?  For what I described here, probably not:���   ���The goal was just to play around with c-lightning and do something more than shuffling a few satoshi back and forth.  Maybe eventually pizza shops will have their own lightning nodes and I can open channels to them directly.���	1
It was a Shiba Inu shooting across the sky: Dogecoin���s run over the past week will be one for the history books. However, for all the fireworks social media data is indicating that the meme���s run may have met its end.  The digital currency, which originally launched in 2013 and has been at the center of a number of absurd headlines and scams over the years, notched another chapter in its often puzzling history over the past few days. On Friday, DOGE managed to eclipse Ethereum in total exchange volume (doubling, in fact), the capstone to a remarkable run that saw it double in price in a day, capping over 5000% gains on the year.  However, at its core DOGE is a meme, and memes are propagated by and fundamentally rely on social media. When the meme can���t spread, the price will crash.  At the time of publication, DOGE is down 35% on the day to $.26, retreating from $.40 highs ��� and social media sentiment data provided by The TIE and Cointelegraph Markets Pro indicates that there���s more pain on the horizon. On Friday, Google Trends posted a Tweet highlighting the worldwide search habits of Bitcoin and DOGE traders. They found that while most of the world remained focused on BTC, American traders only had eyes for Dogecoin.  #doge Qs pic.twitter.com/ZSfNcOxegZ This heatmap concurs with data provided by The TIE. Total Tweet volume referencing DOGE ebbs as the US sleeps and perks up during American daytime hours, often peaking at noon EST, with volume especially robust while DOGE is rallying:  However, simple search and Twitter volume doesn���t always point to a price rally. As Google Trends��� infographic pointed out, sentiment on a volume surge can be mixed: many of the top search terms centered on traders trying to augur how much gas the DOGE rally has left in the tank.  The uncertainty has spread to Twitter as well. While sentiment for the currency was strongest during its run to $.16 on April 14th, the ���waves��� of sentiment matching volume have been decreasing on the run up ��� while the total Twitter volume peaked with DOGE���s price at $.40, it has been slumping for days now: Ultimately, while volume and sentiment are what pushed DOGE to its lofty heights, a rapid price retreat now appear to be pulling Dogecoin back to earth.	0
The Eastman Kodak Company announced Jan. 30 that the launch of their cryptocurrency KODAKCoin would be delayed in order to evaluate the status of potential investors. The delay was announced the day before the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was set to start, according to the project���s Jan. 9 press release. As explained in on the company���s website, Kodak intends to run an ICO that offers security tokens as an ���exempt offering��� ��� this means the company does not have to register their security with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but only ���accredited investors��� can participate in the ICO. The SEC requires that an individual accredited investor have a net worth that exceeds $1 million, or an annual income of at least $200,000, along with other conditions. The company claims it needs ���several weeks��� to verify the ���accredited investors��� status of those who applied to invest in the ICO, which Kodak reports is more than 40,000 people. Potential investors from outside the US will be considered in accordance with their local jurisdictions, the company added. According to Marketwatch, Kodak's stock (KODK) prices sharply increased after the press release of the project on Jan. 9 from $3.1 to almost $11 the next day. However, after the delay was announced on Jan. 30, the stock dropped by more than 18 percent, and continues to trend downwards Feb. 1.	0
With 2017 now firmly in the rearview mirror, it is time to take stock of the best-performing digital currencies of the year. Bitcoin grabbed plenty headlines on its way to a brief stop at $20,000, but in terms of percentage gains, it doesn���t even crack the top 10. Older altcoins like Dash posted impressive gains, reaching a 13,900% return at its mid-December all-time high. Dash���s price retreated somewhat, ending the year with a 9,265% gain to capture fifth place in the rankings. Likewise, Ethereum had a banner year, settling in at number six with gains of 9,162%. Litecoin, one of the oldest altcoins, closed the year with a 5,045% gain and took the number nine spot. Newer coins also fared extremely well, with NEM and Ardor taking number two and three, respectively. Stellar, Binance Coin, OmiseGo and Golem round out the top ten. Bitcoin took fourteenth place with a 1,318% increase.  Ripple, the centralized bank-focused digital currency, claimed the gold medal with a staggering 36,018% return over the past year. A $1,000 investment in Bitcoin on January 1, 2017 would have been worth $13,180 at the end of the year. That same $1,000 invested in Ripple would be worth an eye-popping $360,018. While Ripple had good growth in the second quarter, the true surge happened in the last weeks of December, which saw the currency take the number two spot by market cap away from Ethereum. Though Bitcoin has seen the majority of headlines this past year, it cannot begin to compare with Ripple���s price performance.  With the total cryptocurrency market cap hitting a record high of $673 bln today, there is no sign that 2017���s rally is coming to an end anytime soon. Digital currency enthusiast and journalist Max Keiser believes the total digital currency market cap will reach $5 trln or more, with Bitcoin itself hitting $100,000. Keiser argues that Bitcoin���s path to six figures is based on its status as digital gold. He argues that other currencies are better suited to focus on payments: ���Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.��� Famed stock picker Ronnie Moas is also optimistic about Bitcoin, believing the digital currency will see prices in excess of $28,000: ���The number (of Bitcoin available) is a lot lower than what people think it is. A lot of the Bitcoin has been lost, some of it hasn���t been mined and then you have a lot of people like myself that just won���t sell their Bitcoin at any price.��� And what of altcoins? Bitcoin���s so-called ���dominance��� factor is currently only 37.5%, which is near all-time lows. The Bitcoin dominance metric is a measure of how much of the total cryptocurrency market cap is ���dominated��� by Bitcoin. Bitcoin���s current market cap of $250 bln is divided by the $673 bln market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined. This nets the Bitcoin dominance percentage - 37.2% at press time. As recently as a year ago, Bitcoin���s dominance exceeded 90%.	2
Rumors have been swirling for awhile, but according to Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs will be setting up a cryptocurrency trading desk by the end of June 2018. Bloomberg cites unnamed sources from inside the firm. At present, the investment bank is trying to determine how it will maintain custody of the digital assets. According to the report: ���The move positions Goldman Sachs to become the first large Wall Street firm to make markets in cryptocurrencies.��� Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has previously maintained a cautious but open-minded approach to digital currencies. Blankfein recently said: ���[Bitcoin] is not for me. But there is a lot of things that there weren't for me in the past that have worked out very well. If it was 20 years forward and it worked out, I could tell you why it worked out. But based on everything that I know, I am not guessing that it will work out.��� The firm made headlines earlier this month by saying they will clear Bitcoin futures contracts for their clients, which is an important step for such a usually conservative firm. However, Goldman did insist that at least some of its clients maintain an account with enough funds to cover the full value of the Bitcoin futures they traded. Some customers left the firm as a result. The investment bank is seen as one of the most elite on Wall Street. The firms executives often retire to take powerful positions within the US government. Current treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and former secretary Hank Paulson both had high positions at Goldman. With the staid investment bank giving their imprimatur to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, it���s almost certain that other Wall Street institutions will follow. As did the opening of futures trading on CME and CBOE, this move further legitimizes the cryptocurrency asset class.	2
Cryptocurrency mining botnet malware Smominru has infected more than 526,000 computers using a leaked NSA exploit, The Hacker News reported yesterday, Jan. 31. Software security researchers from cybersecurity company Proofpoint have detected a new global botnet called Smominru, also known as Ismo, that uses a National Security Agency (NSA) exploit EternalBlue to spread Monero mining malware. The EternalBlue exploit was leaked by the so-called Shadow Brokers hackers who were reportedly also behind the 2017 widespread WannaCry ransomware threat, according to The Hacker News. Proofpoint reported that the Smominru botnet has been infecting computers since May 2017, mining about 24 Monero coins per day. To date, the botnet has reportedly managed to mine about 8,900 Monero, or about $2.1 million at press time. The highest number of Smominru-infected PCs has been found in Russia, India, and Taiwan, researchers said. According to Proofpoint, cybercriminals are targeting vulnerable version of Windows, also using a leaked NSA protocol exploit called EsteemAudit. According to thehackernews.com, the experts also notified DDoS protection service SharkTech where Smominru���s command and control infrastructure has been detected, however, they didn���t get a response. As Cointelegraph reported Jan. 28, a massive Monero-mining malware attack via online ads,  mostly attributed to the controversial cryptocurrency mining and advertising platform Coinhive, has affected a huge number of users and online businesses worldwide, including Youtube.	0
The Russian Ministry of Finance has drafted a bill to legalize the trading of cryptocurrencies on approved exchanges, according to a report from local media. Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev has indicated that the government is seeking to provide greater oversight. He said: "This is about the fact that buying and selling [of cryptocurrencies] will be somehow standardized. The general idea is that it will be necessary to buy and sell on official exchanges, as it will be declared, it will be legalized.��� The news may come as a bit of a surprise, particularly given the recent rhetoric from other Russian officials in recent months. However, Moiseev has consistently maintained that Bitcoin would be legalized, though with restrictions. The bill would allow for more open cryptocurrency trading and investment within Russia. Other countries have begun issuing statements either legalizing or banning cryptocurrencies. The Ministry of Finance is still considering which exchanges would be approved. Moiseev indicated that the issue of exchanges is still ���currently unresolved,��� but the overall legalization is now ���more or less clear.��� Many within the industry see the Russian addition of legalized cryptocurrencies as the first among many, as Blockchain and cryptocurrencies continue to remove boundaries between parties through trust networks. Carl Bennetts, co-founder of Status, told Cointelegraph: ���Where traditionally we have relied upon central authorities and institutions in order to conduct trade, blockchains shift this trust, and enable us to move towards a society that does away with middle-men and enables truly peer-to-peer trade, commerce and law.���	2
If prices plummet in an illiquid market, how soon before anyone notices? While fungible tokens traded on centralized and decentralized exchanges have significant transparency regarding price movements, nonfungible tokens can be harder to track. Because of their illiquid nature, gauging the sentiment of the overall market for a project can be difficult ��� a dynamic that has led one eGirl Capital member, Mewny, to dub NFT corrections ���silent crashes.���  i really like @mewn21 phrasing of NFT crash as a "silent crash"why? in liquid markets, you can see prices going down every day. in NFT-land, sellers have slower "market reaction". instead of sellers adjusting prices downwards everyday for a month, it may just -80% "overnight" In a silent crash, speculators might not even be aware that one is underway ��� buyers simply evaporate and sellers fail to move their wares. However, metrics such as ���floor price��� ��� the lowest price at which a NFT can be bought for a particular project ��� as well as total volume can indicate that a bull is turning into a bear.  There could be bad news on the horizon for NFT collectors, too, as signs are pointing to a nasty silent crash underway.  CryptoPunks, among the earliest and most popular NFT projects for collectors, have seen a over 40% decrease in floor price to 14 ETH (roughly $28,000 at the time of publication). The price capitulation has led to some on-chain horror stories today, such as one speculator who sold a Punk for 16 ETH after purchasing it for 25.5, and another that sold for 27.99 after a 42 ETH purchase: Punk 8282 bought for 27.99 ETH ($57,228.07 USD) by 0xd3e2e7 from 0x691b87. https://t.co/NnobRb079D #cryptopunks #ethereum pic.twitter.com/rhXwiDraz6 CryptoPunks aren't the only high-profile project experiencing a marketwide correction, either. Data from evaluate.market shows that sales volume in multiple price categories for NBA Top Shot have declined precipitously since a Feb. 22 peak.  One semi-anon and self-described Top Shot enthusiast, Jordan, who charted the downturn points to two specific populations for the steep fall. ���The market has been trending downward since the Feb 22. It seems like there are two types of sellers. One, the investor who got in early and wants to cash out with exponential profit. Two, the investor who bought at or near the top and can���t stomach to watch their investment lose value by the day,��� he said.  @topshotanalytix @economist @girldadNFT for everyone wishing they got into TopShot in Jan instead of Feb. Well ... welcome to January. pic.twitter.com/IY1TslV8I0 Watching price floors plummet is difficult regardless of the project. According to market-tracking website Nonfungible, the pullback is effecting the entire market: total number of sales, total value of sales, and active wallets are all down on a 7-day and 30-day basis.  Jordan ultimately thinks this a healthy, short-term pullback, however.	0
The Arizona Senate passed a bill on Feb. 8 to allow residents in the state to pay their taxes with cryptocurrencies, public records indicate. The Senate Bill 1091, which intends to enable cryptocurrencies for tax payment, was introduced Jan. 10, 2018 and passed by the Senate Finance Committee by a 4-3 vote on Jan. 24. On Feb. 8, the Senate passed the bill by a 16-13 margin, with one no-vote. The bill has now been sent to Arizona���s House of Representatives. If the bill is adopted, Arizona would become the first state in the U.S. to accept cryptocurrency tax payments by the year of 2020, as stated on the public record. The bill would allow taxpayers of the state to use ���a payment gateway, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or any other cryptocurrency recognized by the department, using electronic peer-to-peer systems.��� According to the bill, the Arizona Department of Revenue, upon receiving payments in crypto for ���tax and any interest and penalties���, would be obligated to convert the cryptocurrency payments to U.S. dollars within 24 hours. Arizona State Republican Rep. Jeff Weninger, who co-sponsored the bill, said the tax measure intends to turn the state into a center of  ���blockchain and digital currency technology in the future���. Referring to the tax bill, Weninger told Fox News this week: "It's one of a litany of bills that we're running that is sending a signal to everyone in the United States, and possibly throughout the world, that Arizona is going to be the place to be for blockchain and digital currency technology in the future." In September, 2017, Cointelegraph reported that the municipality of Chiasso, Switzerland will enable its residents to pay taxes in Bitcoin starting January 2018, following the lead of Zug.	2
According to some Harvard economics professors, Bitcoin will eventually be destroyed through the weight of government regulation. Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff believes that the risk of financial anonymity will eventually create an environment where regulation would crush Bitcoin. He said: ���Small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies���would be desirable but large-scale anonymous payments would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.��� The perspective is shared, though in a different vein, by the counterpart, Jeffrey A. Miron, whose Libertarian perspective makes him more lassez-faire. Nevertheless, he believes that central governments will eventually drive the technology out of existence. He said: ���It [government] could let cryptocurrencies peacefully exist, and not accept them as a means of payment, and that���s what I think it should do. But my guess is that sooner or later governments are going to regulate cryptocurrencies out of existence.��� The potential for government regulation is certainly real, as multiple nations have limited access to or exchange of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. China famously banned ICOs (initial coin offerings) and has restricted Bitcoin exchange access. It should also, of course, be remembered that Bitcoin is by no means anonymous. Users routinely make mistakes which weaken or eliminate Bitcoin���s psuedo-anonymity. As Cointelegraph has previously reported, the IRS has engaged the services of Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to help them tax cheats who don���t report their Bitcoin profits.	0
The Brazilian government is seeking to move popular petitions, an inefficient electoral system of the country, onto the Ethereum network, to process hundreds of millions of votes on the immutable Blockchain network. In Brazil, popular petitions enable over 145 mln voters across the country to come to a consensus on important political decisions. But, for many decades, political experts and analysts have questioned the logistical issue of popular petitions, and political commentators have described the structural problem of the electoral system of Brazil as the basis for most of the country���s political issues. Gabriel Barbosa, a research associate at the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, wrote, ���when people are living paycheck to paycheck, or as the common saying in Brazil goes, ���selling their lunch to buy their dinner,��� the cost of political participation becomes high enough so that people are excluded from the political process,��� emphasizing the lack of proper institutions that handle the cost of political engagement. As Joon Ian Wong of Quartz reported, Brazilian legislators led by Congress legislative adviser Ricardo Fernandes Paix��o and university professor Everton Fraga are planning on ways to utilize the Ethereum Blockchain network to store and process electoral votes, as a part of a larger initiative to improve Brazil���s political system, which The Economist described as ���sleazy.��� The key to employing a Blockchain system in processing petitions and electoral votes is to encrypt votes onto the immutable Blockchain network as transactions, to ensure that the specific piece of data remains unalterable and invulnerable to manipulation. Essentially, processing petition signatures on the Ethereum network would require smart contracts, and the system would operate similarly as other decentralized applications that exist on the network. The electoral system of Brazil would act as a decentralized application of its own with an independent digital token, that is used to process every vote on the Blockchain. Henrique Costa, a Universidade de Brasilia law professor, told QZ that the lack of an immutable platform to collect signatures of votes had been a real issue for the government in the past. ���In part this is due to the absence of a platform that can securely collect the signatures of one percent of voters. We���ve been through a sort of crisis regarding the legitimacy���of our laws. Although the popular initiative does exist, there is no secure way to collect people���s signatures so people can propose bills themselves.��� Within the Brazilian electoral system, any popular petition with the signatures of one percent of the country���s populations is required to be heard in Congress. But, because of the lack of an institution and a platform that handles petition votes, the group that rallies behind a particular petition also needs to find a legislator to adopt it. Consequently, the probability of popular petitions being heard in  Congress has significantly decreased, even though many petitions have gathered signatures from the one percent of voters. Currently, the Brazilian government is exploring the possibility of using a mobile app based on the Ethereum Blockchain network with which residents and citizens can submit petition votes. Since decentralized applications can operate on mobile systems, the Brazilian petition and electoral system can operate in a similar way. Since broadcasting every single signature as a transaction of its own is highly efficient and costly, the Brazilian government will use a system called hashing to combine all of the daily votes into one transaction and broadcast it to the main Ethereum Blockchain network. Fraga, one of the two leading advisers of the project, stated that the integration of Ethereum into the Brazilian���s inefficient and impractical electoral system would be a celebration of democracy if it passes Congress and becomes implemented. He said: ���It would be a celebration of democracy. With this project, we are doing what the constitution says, but in practice, it hasn���t [yet] happened.���	2
Jan. 13 marked an important milestone for Bitcoin when 16.8 million bitcoins (BTC), or 80 percent of the entire Bitcoin supply, were mined. This means only 4.2 million bitcoins, or 20 percent, are left to mine until Bitcoin���s 21 million supply cap is reached. BTC contains the 21 mln cap built into its protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto, first mentioned in their 2008 White Paper, as a way to introduce digital scarcity to cryptocurrency. With such a cap in place, the more bitcoins are mined, the more scarcity is produced on the market. Scarcity arguably creates demand, which in turns makes the coins more valuable. Once 21 million bitcoins have been mined, it will become even harder to obtain them, also potentially making each coin more valuable. Miners currently receive a 12.5 BTC reward for every block that they mine, but Nakamoto���s protocol also requires that the mining reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, or approximately four years. The next miner halving will take place within two years, approximately in early June 2020 depending on hashrate, bringing the rewards down to 6.25 BTC per mined block. Not every digital currency is mineable like BTC. Some cryptocurrencies are created with the entire supply released all at once, in which case the total supply is either held or in circulation and there is no way to ���mine��� or mint new coins. Some examples of non-mineable digital currencies are Ripple, IOTA, NEM, NEO, Qtum, Omisego, Lisk, Stratis, Waves, and EOS. Skeptics have proposed that it is theoretically possible to increase Bitcoin���s 21 million capped supply of Bitcoin via a 51 percent or a Sybil attack, but so far neither of these manipulations has proven feasible in the case of BTC. Altcoin Krypton, which is based on Ethereum, experienced a 51 percent attack in August 2016, but no other such attacks have taken place since then. BTC is still recovering from the Dec. 22 market dip, trading at an average of $14,200 and up about 4.75 percent over 24 hours to press time.	0
Bitcoin has cemented its glory year by hitting $20,000 barely a month after achieving five figures for the first time. After several weeks of considerable volatility, mixing rapid growth with sudden declines, momentum finally boosted Bitcoin to its new historic high. Outperforming almost everyone���s expectations in 2017, Bitcoin prices received a decisive push from Wall Street regulated futures trading, as well as the imminent implementation of the Lightning Network. CBOE launched its Bitcoin futures product on Dec. 10, and CME (a much larger market) will begin trading the cryptocurrency���s futures on Monday, Dec. 18. Markets reacted to rising prices with a snowball effect, triggering mass consumer interest in both buying and trading the virtual currency. Over the last few weeks, the Coinbase app has been at the top of Apple���s ���most downloaded apps��� several times. Bitcoin has grown by 1,950 percent in 2017, having started the year at the comparatively tiny $974.  The barrier was in fact crossed considerably earlier in some markets, specifically those where demand outpaces supply and economic policy is fragile, such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Having broadly failed to foresee just how quickly Bitcoin would rise, commentators are now focusing on the forthcoming year and how governments will react to the rapid growth of digital currencies. Bankers, mainstream media and pundits continue to call Bitcoin a bubble, even as the bull marches on.	2
While sources differ on the number of millionaires in the world, Credit Suisse estimates the number at about 35 million. This figure accounts for all ���financial and nonfinancial wealth,��� including assets, collectibles, and homes. This is a remarkable number when compared to the total number of Bitcoins that will ever exist. While there are roughly 35 million millionaires in the world, there will only ever be a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins. That���s right--there will never be enough Bitcoins in existence for every millionaire in the world to own even a single one. While you let that thought sink in, let���s consider what gives Bitcoin its value. Granted that there are numerous features we could cite, including a global network, an immutable Blockchain and a means to transfer wealth from one person to another without ever involving a middleman. These are all fine features, to be sure. But what really makes Bitcoin valuable are two properties: scarcity and authenticity. Bitcoin has value for the same reason gold has value: people want it and there isn���t enough to go around. New gold can���t merely be created; one has to find a gold mine and go through the difficult, capital-intensive and expensive process of mining and refining the gold. Because neither governments nor factories can create more of it, gold is scarce. This scarcity imparts value. Many unusual items have been used as currencies or stores of value in earlier societies. One of the more famous is wampum, a necklace made from a certain kind of seashell that was rare in the Americas. A currency doesn���t necessarily have to be inherently useful in order to function, but it absolutely must be scarce. This requirement for scarcity is the reason counterfeiting has such severe penalties. In fact, in earlier times, counterfeiting was punishable by death. Counterfeiters undermined confidence in a currency by making it less scarce. Doing so, at scale, could wreck an entire economy. Gold has another feature that���s extremely important for any store of value or currency: authenticity. For millennia, gold has been used as both a currency and as a store of value. It has been prized throughout its history because of its scarcity. Gold has been used in money, in jewelry, in crowns and in palaces. Gold is universally associated with wealth. Since Bitcoin lacks the thousands of years of history, culture and tradition that impart so much value and mystique to gold, it's easy to write the currency off as inauthentic. But in a world that's rapidly moving from analog to digital, even a "new" technology like Bitcoin can be authentic. When it comes to digital money, Bitcoin certainly fits the bill. Of the thousands of different tokens that label themselves ���digital currency,��� Bitcoin is the very first. That grants it an important claim to the property of authenticity. There are many great altcoins, but none of them were first. None of them can reasonably claim to be the best. None have a higher market capitalization. Bitcoin is the first, has the largest network effect, is the most universally recognized and is authentic. As Bitcoin inches toward mainstream adoption, economists and finance experts debate whether it���s an asset or a currency. In terms of valuing Bitcoin, that argument couldn���t be more irrelevant. It doesn���t matter how people use Bitcoin; what matters is why people choose to own it. The future of Bitcoin is almost certainly a bright one. Various analysts and traders have tried to guess the value of Bitcoin in the future, with some saying it might even reach $15,000 in the near term. But forget about the near term. If Bitcoin is digital gold, then its long term value is what really matters. Bitcoin is rare. Bitcoin is scarce. The vast majority of people don���t own even a fraction of one. What���s Bitcoin���s long-term potential? Bitcoin could easily become so valuable that even millionaires can���t afford an entire coin.	2
Litecoin (LTC) founder Charlie Lee announced today on Reddit and Twitter that he has completely unloaded all his Litecoin holdings via selling and donation. He wrote on Reddit: ���For the first time in 6+ years, I no longer own a single LTC that���s not stored in a physical Litecoin. (I do have a few of those as collectibles.)��� According to his Reddit post, the amount Lee sold was a small percentage of GDAX���s daily volume, and it did not crash the market. Please read the whole post. Reddit thread is here: https://t.co/4xIZl7IC2V pic.twitter.com/VoIlA0Xjj3 According to the announcement, Lee decided to sell all of his Litecoin because of the potential for conflict of interest, given the influence his personal statements can have on the coin���s price. He explained that by selling all his LTC, he can fully separate his own opinions and actions from the performance of the cryptocurrency, stating: ������whenever I tweet about Litecoin price or even just good or bads news, I get accused of doing it for personal benefit. Some people even think I short LTC! So in a sense, it is a conflict of interest for me to hold LTC and tweet about it because I have so much influence.��� Lee did give some clue regarding his future, reassuring users that he is in no way abandoning his creation. With his own personal finances stable, he plans to devote himself to Litecoin, and expects to meet with a variety of other rewards beyond the price appreciation of his coins: ���Don���t worry. I���m not quitting Litecoin. I will still spend all my time working on Litecoin. When Litecoin succeeds, I will still be rewarded in lots of different ways, just not directly via ownership of coins. I now believe this is the best way for me to continue to oversee Litecoin���s growth.��� Lee also added an update to his Reddit post clarifying that he had no part in the Bitcoin Cash trading hiccup on Coinbase���s GDAX.   Litecoin has risen to all-time high values in recent weeks. At press time, LTC was trading at $312, down from an all-time high of $371 yesterday, Dec. 19. In the past month, LTC price has seen an almost 300 percent increase, up from $71.41 on Nov. 20.	0
CNBC India has revealed that the Indian government committee has ruled in favor of regulating Bitcoin. On April 14, Cointelegraph reported that the Inter-Disciplinary Committee within India���s Ministry of Finance was actively investigating the legal status of Bitcoin and considering the possibility of regulating the market. Over the past three years, the big three Indian Bitcoin exchanges including Zebpay, Coinsecure and Unocoin operated with self-regulated trading platforms with strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering systems in place, despite the lack of regulations in the digital currency industry and market. The efforts of the Bitcoin exchanges in India to self-regulate the market allowed the Indian government to reconsider the Bitcoin and digital currency sectors, regardless of the criticisms by several politicians that significantly lack knowledge in cryptocurrency. On March 24, Cointelegraph reported that Kirit Somaiya, a member of parliament of the ruling BJP in India, was harshly criticized for his description of Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme. In a letter to the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India, Somaiya explained that Bitcoin is a pyramid Ponzi-type scheme. However, Somaiya was criticized for his inability to understand the structural and fundamental difference between a Ponzi scheme and Bitcoin. In spite of the negative attitude of certain politicians, the Indian government has come to a decision to regulate the market and provide an even playing field for Bitcoin exchanges that have allocated a significant amount of resources to standardize the market and industry. Back in April, Mohit Kalra, CEO of Coinsecure, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in India, told Cointelegraph in an interview that the Indian government has finally started to take Bitcoin seriously and are considering the possibility of regulating the market. Kalra said: ���Finally, something positive for the industry. Authorities are now taking this technology seriously. We have been trying to get their attention for years now. I am glad it's all happening at the right time. At Coinsecure, we are seeing a massive increase in the number of users and volumes. We are positive with what will happen in these coming three months.��� On June 20, CNBC India announced that the Indian government committee has ruled in favor of regulating Bitcoin and is currently establishing a task force to create various regulatory frameworks with the aim of fully legalizing Bitcoin in the short-term. Prior to the announcement of the Indian government, Chris Burniske, ARK Invest���s crypto lead, noted that the trading volumes in India have been on the rise. Burniske previously revealed that the Indian Bitcoin exchange market is responsible for processing around 11 percent of Bitcoin-to-USD trades. Hello #India?? we've been expecting you! Very curious to see where this goes for #bitcoin. h/t @BKBrianKelly pic.twitter.com/9uacy5GZH9 The legalization of Bitcoin in India is expected to further increase trading volumes and Bitcoin activities in India by significant margins.	0
Following in the footsteps of Russia and Dubai, Israel is considering offering a national cryptocurrency - a digital shekel - which would correspond in value to physical shekels. According to the sources close to the Finance Ministry, Israel���s black market is approximately 22 percent of the country���s gross domestic product. A digital currency, registered with the government of Israel, would make black market transactions less possible. Additionally, per the news source, the government is considering legislation that would substantially reduce the amount of physical cash in the economy. For example, one suggestion would be a law against paying wages in cash. The process for the creation of the digital shekel is just getting underway, however. The government has offered the ���Economic Arrangements Bill,��� which, if passed would create a separate panel for the Bank of Israel to consider creating the digital shekel. The addition of the physical cash laws is the result of a failure by the Knesset to pass legislation of the same ilk two years ago. The pressure for digital currency adoption is high, as recent comments from the Israeli Prime Minister indicate. Colu, an Israel-based Blockchain wallet application, has been part of the conversation with the Israeli government in pursuing a digital currency. Mark Smargon, VP Blockchain Colu told Cointelegraph: "The Israeli regulators have been looking into digital currencies for a while, we were even part of this conversation. If this initiative becomes a reality, Colu will be happy to collaborate...as we believe digital currencies are the future of money."	2
During a meeting with Herman Gref, the president of Russia���s largest bank Sberbank, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke about the importance of not falling behind in Blockchain development. Sberbank already introduced Blockchain in their document transfer and storage systems by partnering with Russia���s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in December of last year. The bank is also reportedly soon opening a cryptocurrency exchange in Switzerland. Gref addressed Putin directly, speaking about what he sees as the need for programs for training professionals in Blockchain due to the sheer size of the industry worldwide. Gref also spoke of a need for ���very careful regulation,��� not ���prohibitions,��� in order to promote innovation. In response, Putin, without specifically mentioning Blockchain, brings up the question of why Russia needs this industry, when ���we have everything [...] oil, gas, coal, metals of all kinds [...] gold, platinum, diamonds, everything!��� He then says that the industry is developing well in Russia and has a ���good intellectual base.��� Putin then adds that Russia needs its own ���burst,��� and quotes an analogy given by a former minister of oil of an unnamed Arab country: ���The Stone Age did not end due to the lack of stones, but because new technologies appeared.��� In Putin���s opinion, countries that are late to adopting this new technology, which he never mentions by name, ���will very quickly fall under the dependence of the leaders of this development,��� which is something that ���Russia cannot allow this in any case:��� ���We need to take the maximum advantage of these factors [...] to guarantee this progress into the future.��� Putin has brought up the idea in the past of Russia launching its own ���CryptoRuble,��� but its legality and launch is a continuous grey area. More recently, in January of this year, after consulting with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Putin suggested launching a new multinational cryptocurrency to be adopted by BRICS and EEU countries to take advantage of Blockchain and smart contracts.	2
Venezuelan President Maduro has ordered the issuance of the first 100 mln Petros, an oil-backed national cryptocurrency. He also indicated that each Petro would have the value of a single barrel of oil. He said: ���I���ve ordered the issue of 100 million Petros, based on national wealth. Each Petro will have the value of a barrel of Venezuela���s oil.��� The first national meeting of Petro miners will occur on January 14, along with the publication of the whitepaper. The announcement is in line with the previous statements from Maduro that the country would issue an oil-backed cryptocurrency. The country���s massive hyperinflation problems have led to widespread lack of trust in the national currency, the Bolivar. This has caused much of the population with access to appropriate technology to pursue Bitcoin as a means of stable transactions - called ���Bitcoinization��� by some economists. Other countries including Zimbabwe have also seen widespread Bitcoin adoption in the face of financial instability.	2
On Wednesday, Kazakhstan, the second-largest country in the world when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC) mining hash rate, experienced unprecedented political unrest due to a sharp rise in fuel prices. As a result, the country's presiding cabinet resigned, but not before the state-owned Kazakhtelecom shut down the nation's internet, causing network activity to plunge to 2% of daily heights. The move dealt a severe blow to Bitcoin mining activity in the country. As per data compiled by YCharts.com, the Bitcoin network's overall hash rate declined 13.4% in the hours after the shutdown from about 205,000 petahash per second (PH/s) to 177,330 PH/s. The country accounts for 18% of the Bitcoin network's hash activity.  Just days prior, the Kazakh government removed price caps on liquefied petroleum gas used for car fuel to align with market conditions, which doubled its price overnight, sparking violent protests. At the time of publication, the internet remains inaccessible in Kazakhstan. If extended, the consequences could be severe as internet services aside, the Data Center Industry & Blockchain Association of Kazakhstan expects the country to generate $1.5 billion from legal cryptocurrency mining (and another $1.5 billion in illicit) activities over the next five years. The country's low energy prices have attracted both domestic and foreign entities to set up shop for Bitcoin mining. According to Global Petrol Prices, electricity in Kazakhstan costs on average just $0.055 per kWh for businesses, a fraction of the $0.12 per kWh paid by U.S. businesses.	0
Update: Microsoft has restored Bitcoin as a payment option "after working with our provider to ensure lower Bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers." In a blow for Bitcoin enthusiasts, Microsoft Corporation has removed the ���Bitcoin��� payment option from its active payment instruments. The company was an early adopter, and former CEO Bill Gates had expressed his support for the cryptocurrency. Microsoft���s decision has been confirmed through publicly posted chats with customer service representatives. The main cause of the cessation appears to be volatility and risk associated with the cryptocurrency. Customers are still able to use Bitcoin to add money to their Microsoft account. Accounts can be used to purchase games, movies, and apps, but these funds are not usable in the Microsoft store. Furthermore, the funds are non-refundable. Microsoft is one of the larger vendors to remove their Bitcoin payment option. Other companies like Square added Bitcoin support in 2017. However, with the substantial increases in price and volatility through the last quarter of the year, the risk for companies like Microsoft appears to have increased. Bitcoin is down four percent on the day, according to Coinmarketcap.com.	0
Rumors are swirling about a trader with nearly unlimited funds who is manipulating the Bitcoin markets. This trader, nicknamed "Spoofy," received his nom de guerre because of his efforts to ���spoof��� the market, primarily on Bitfinex.  According to the Dodd-Frank act, spoofing is the practice of: "Bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution" In other words, spoofers place a large buy order just below other buy orders, or a large sell order just above other sell orders. The idea is to make traders think that somebody with deep pockets is getting ready to buy or sell, in hopes of moving the market. If traders see a sell order of 2000 Bitcoin, for instance, they may rush to panic sell before the whale crashes the price. The catch is this: If the price approaches the spoofer���s order, he immediately cancels it. Spoofing is actually illegal, but as Bitcoin markets are largely unregulated, it���s quite common. What is unusual in this case is the enormous bankroll that Spoofy has at his disposal. He regularly places orders approaching $60 mln. Even more unusual is that most of Spoofy���s activity occurs on a single exchange: Bitfinex. This exchange came under fire earlier this spring when Wells Fargo cut off their banking ties. As a result, it���s virtually impossible to deposit fiat on Bitfinex without going through intermediaries. Spoofy has massive sums of both fiat and Bitcoin on that exchange, and is likely one of the only traders who does. Spoofy has a number of weapons in his arsenal, including spoofing and wash trading. As BitCrypto���ed points out in a recent blog post: ���Spoofy makes the price go up when he wants it to go up, and Spoofy makes the price go down when he wants it to go down, and he���s got the coin��� both USD, and Bitcoin, of course, to pull it off, and with impunity on Bitfinex.��� The BitCrypto���ed blog also describes Spoofy���s wash trades, when he trades with himself by either selling into his own buy orders or vice versa. Wash trading at high volumes can induce a frenzy of buying or selling, as other traders respond to the high trading volume. Spoofy can execute wash trades at very low cost, about $1,000 per million dollars of volume. When Bitfinex announced its plan to distribute Bitcoin Cash, it initially planned to distribute Bitcoin Cash to holders of short positions. Immediately following that announcement, a single trader short sold tens of thousands of Bitcoin all at once. It���s likely this trader was Spoofy himself, planning on acquiring as much Bitcoin Cash as possible. The large number of shorts on Bitfinex also led many to believe that an epic short squeeze was coming, and many Bitcoin traders purchase coins in expectation of this. Suddenly, he ���claimed��� all of his own shorts, closing them using his own Bitcoin. The number of shorts dropped drastically without affecting the price at all. The identity of Spoofy remains a mystery. He may be a single trader, a group of colluding traders or even the Bitfinex management themselves. He sometimes seeks to drop Bitcoin price, and sometimes acts to increase it. Spoofy���s activity also drives the price on other exchanges, as arbitrage takes place. Because BItcoin is so thinly traded, a single large ���whale��� can potentially move the entire market. While Spoofy is certainly exercising outsized control over the Bitcoin price, it is uncertain how much of an affect this is having on the markets. The price is currently rising, having finally surmounted the $3,000 barrier. The only problem? Nobody knows how much of this increase is organic and sustainable, and how much is due to the market manipulation of Spoofy and others.	0
After Jamie Dimon drew a line in the sand for JPMorgan, calling it a ���fraud,��� the company has once again stepped over that line, praising the digital coin as a ���new gold.��� Analysts at JPMorgan believe that Bitcoin has changed its shape and that it could soon be joining gold as a reliable, long-term way to store wealth. Recent growth and recent changes have seen Bitcoin lean more towards being digital gold, and this is where JPMorgan see its value. According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the incredible spike in the value of Bitcoin is allowing it to start competing as an asset class; and seemingly at the same time drop out of the currency race. There are changes afoot in the Bitcoin market, especially when it comes to making the digital currency easier to invest in. Panigirtzoglou said: ���The prospective launch of Bitcoin futures contracts by established exchanges, in particular, has the potential to add legitimacy and thus increase the appeal of the cryptocurrency market to both retail and institutional investors.��� There is an ongoing debate over which is more popular, and if one can kill the other when it comes to talking about investing in gold and Bitcoin. However, the precious metal may be steady and safe, thus not as exciting as Bitcoin, but it still holds a large chunk of influential sway. Bitcoin still falls short of Gold���s $6 tln valuation, however, it is the speed at which it has grown which is more impressive. The huge growth spurt could make cryptocurrencies match or even surpass gold quite soon as an investable asset. Around the time Dimon was spurting his rhetoric on Bitcoin, there was a feeling that the banks and Bitcoin were in a battle royale. The one was being challenged by a young upstart of a digital currency, and losing ground. Banks were nervous of Bitcoin as a currency and how it could liberate people from the clutches of the government-backed fiat, however, that fight has died down somewhat as the future is now aimed at accumulating the valuable asset. Instead of a flying in the face of the institutionalized banking system, Bitcoin looks like it has outgrown its angsty teen stages.There is now a literal digital gold rush as the fear of missing out sweeps the globe.	2
About six months ago the news was littered with companies that were looking to integrate Bitcoin as a payment system. However, in the fast-paced cryptocurrency ecosystem, things have changed dramatically.   Now, there is a host of companies either turning away from Bitcoin or doing a full U-turn. Microsoft recently announced that after almost three years it would stop accepting Bitcoin. However, it did reserve that position after taking its own steps to: ���ensure lower Bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers.���   Steam, the gaming platform, also canceled its use of Bitcoin as a payment system in early December last year. Their reasons resonated with the general consensus, citing high fees and incredible volatility as the main issues.   It is not only those outside of the crypto market though; The North American Bitcoin Conference set to be held in Miami next week, is no longer taking Bitcoin for last-minute tickets.   It has been a bone of contention with Bitcoin since its fees started averaging about $2, now with transactions costing upwards of $20, people have started looking at Bitcoin as something other than a digital currency.   The North American Bitcoin Conference said on its website that network congestion and manual processing influenced the decision to stop accepting payments in cryptocurrencies.   "We have, and always will, accept cryptocurrencies for our conferences, up to fourteen days before the event," the organizers wrote. "However, due to the manual inputting of data in our ticketing platforms when paid in cryptocurrencies, we decided to shut down Bitcoin payments for last minute sales due to print deadlines."   It would seem that it is possible to link Bitcoin���s change in categorization back to when SegWit2x failed to launch and thus sent Bitcoin on a monster rally that saw it end the year 13 times stronger than when it started.   Bitcoin was having problems defining itself as a digital currency, or as digital gold, and due to the nature of the cryptocurrency, it was defined democratically as SegWit2x was not taken up - for a number of reasons.   It was thought that SegWit2x would help lower costs and speed up the network; however, Bitcoin���s value as a store of value would probably take a hit.   And, with interest in Bitcoin being driven by the mainstream acceptance of the digital currency to be an asset that grew exponentially, it seemed that the community was keen to see it move towards being so-called digital gold.   The very fluid nature of Bitcoin���s evolution means that it could still become a very useful and viable currency if the community decides. The latest change that could be on the cards is the Lightning Network which would help hugely with Bitcoin scaling issue.   The Lightning Network would implement a smart contract script into the Bitcoin network that would open private payment channels between a peer and all of the other peers they transact with. In addition to all the private payment channels they are a part of, each of peer would have one channel open to the Bitcoin Blockchain.   #CT_questions Do you think #Bitcoin Lightning Network will be implemented on a large scale this year, and will it help with the congestion problems?	0
Sunday, Feb. 25: the crypto markets are down almost all across the board, but not by very much. Of the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap, no coin is down more than 5 percent in the 24-hour period by press time. Only altcoins Litecoin (LTC) and IOTA out of those top ten coins are in the green. Litecoin is trading for about $208.53, up almost 2.8 percent over a 24-hour period by press time. IOTA is up even more, roughly 5 percent over a 24-hour period, trading for about $1.80 by press time. Bitcoin (BTC) has spent the past day and a half below $10,000, a mark that it had broken through again on Feb. 15. This week saw BTC almost hitting $12,000 before slowly dropping until it hit an intra-weekly low today. BTC is currently trading for around $9,552.92, down a little more than 3 percent over a 24-hour period by press time.  Ethereum (ETH) is down 1.21 percent over a 24-hour period by press time, trading for around $827.65. Total market cap is almost $420 bln by press time, down from the intra-week high of over $500 bln, but higher than the intra-week low thus far of around $417 bln.	0
Cryptocurrency investment app Abra���s CEO forecast that ���all hell will break loose��� in Bitcoin and altcoin markets this year in a fresh mainstream media interview March 28. Speaking to Business Insider two weeks after the startup announced it had raised $40mln in new funding since October, CEO Bill Barhydt said western institutional money would begin to ���dip its toes��� into crypto assets in 2018. In doing so, Barhydt continues a popular narrative that institutional investors ���waiting��� for an opportune moment will transform Bitcoin and major altcoin price performance. Bitcoin continued to sink towards fresh bi-weekly lows March 29, circling around $7600 according to Cointelegraph���s price tracker. Ethereum, which has lost 52% of its value in a month, is set to challenge $400 a coin. ���I talk to hedge funds, high net worth individuals, even commodity speculators. They look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see it as a huge opportunity,��� Barhydt nonetheless reports adopting a conspicuously bullish tone. ���Once that happens, all hell will break loose. Once the floodgates are opened, they're opened.��� Even cryptocurrency industry analysts have recently aired caution about short-term price prospects for Bitcoin. Regular commentator Tone Vays had warned during recent highs that until resistance around $12,000 was cleared, prices would continue to post lacklustre performance - and could even drop lower than current levels. For Barhydt, however, future potential takes prevalence over short-term volatility between $6000 and $12,000. ���There really is zero large-scale institutional money from the west in crypto right now. That is happening in Japan,��� he continued. ���...We're getting closer and closer to real clarity in the West that it's OK putting half a percent of your assets into crypto.���	0
A rampant bear market might result in the staunchest supporters beginning to doubt it. Michael Novogratz, who was planning to launch a $500 mln hedge fund in cryptocurrencies, has delayed his plans and says Bitcoin could drop as low as $8,000 before rebounding. Michael Novogratz has been a long-term Bitcoin bull. He has revised his price projections upwards three times in as many months, given Bitcoin's rapid price increase. In October 2017, he said that he wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin crossed $10,000 by April 2018. With Bitcoin's rapid appreciation, he revised his target in November 2017, predicting that it will reach $10,000 by the end of the year. Towards the end of November 2017, he even made a courageous prediction that Bitcoin would reach $40,000 in 2018. Novogratz had earlier said that Bitcoin might be a bubble, but there was money to be made from it. He had planned to raise $500 mln for a hedge fund which would invest in cryptocurrencies. The fund would have been the largest to focus on cryptocurrencies and was expected to launch in mid-December. However, he has announced that the hedge fund plan was paused for now. Speaking to Bloomberg, Mike Novogratz said We didn���t like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we���re doing. I look pretty smart pressing the pause button right now. One of the factors which influenced Novogratz would be the conflicts of interest involved, if for instance he bought Bitcoin for the fund and sold Bitcoin in his personal account. There are just so many conflicts in that business. It was going to be more complicated than I wanted. Mike Novogratz was one of the early investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum, buying Bitcoins when the price was $50 and buying Ether during its initial crowdsale for about 30 cents. He has been selling Bitcoin and Ether periodically and is estimated to have made $250 million by liquidating a portion of his holdings in 2017. Despite his earlier bullishness, he now believes that Bitcoin could plunge to $8,000 and take awhile to recover. He predicts that the price will stabilize between $10,000 and $16,000. The crypto rally in 2017 has enthused many neophyte digital currency investors. However, when veterans like Novogratz begin to call for caution, it might be wise to listen. Investors should always remember the cardinal rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose.	0
CryptoKitties, the Ethereum-based digital kitten collectibles game, has processed more than $12 million in sales on its decentralized marketplace. Essentially, CryptoKitties is a Tamagotchi-like game developed as a decentralized application (dapp) launched on top of the Ethereum protocol. Each digital kitten represents a unique crypto asset and the ownership of it cannot be altered, as it is integrated onto the immutable Ethereum Blockchain. According to Kitty Sales, five of the rarest digital kittens on the CryptoKitties platform were sold for over $100,000 each, with the most expensive digital kitten being sold at around $120,000. Some analysts and researchers have questioned the value of these digital kittens, and whether the platform itself is sustainable in the long-term. While the vast majority of CryptoKitties critics perceive the platform as a simple collectibles game, prominent venture capital investor, Andreessen Horowitz partner, and Earn.com CEO Balaji Srinivasan explained that CryptoKitties has demonstrated frictionless international trading of digital assets on a Blockchain at a large-scale. He believes the game has proven that assets can be traded in a decentralized manner without the involvement of intermediaries. Using the same mechanism and technology that CryptoKitties uses, a digital asset can be exchanged seamlessly, through a decentralized platform. If the CryptoKitties platform is evaluated as a peer-to-peer digital assets exchange, the technology���s use case becomes more intriguing than a simple collectibles game. In the long-term, investors and traders will be able to exchange digital assets using decentralized applications on the Ethereum network. They will no longer have to rely on centralized platforms that are vulnerable to a wide array of threats and are equipped with strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies.  Moreover, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market have proven that the concept of intrinsic value is flawed. Value is subjective and no asset or currency in the global market is intrinsically worth a particular value. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin provided the auction of Leonardo Da Vinci���s Salvator Mundi as an example. The painting by Da Vinci was auctioned off to a Saudi price at $450 million, by Christie���s. The painting could represent $450 million in value to Saudi Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, the buyer of the painting, but to others, the painting may not be worth that amount. https://t.co/1U7FvWgFLV   Crypto (kitties) is a reflection of the world at large. Buterin further emphasized that CryptoKitties: ���Illustrates very well that the value of a Blockchain extends far beyond applications that would literally get shut down by banks or governments if they did not use one.��� The value of the digital kittens on the CryptoKitties platform is based on rarity and scarcity, like every other cryptocurrency in the market with a fixed monetary supply. On top of that, CryptoKitties has demonstrated the possibility of frictionless and seamless trading of digital assets, which could be implemented at a larger scale in major industries such as finance.	2
PhD candidate Yonatan Sompolinsky and Dr. Aviv Zohar, both of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, released a paper this week on a new scalable BlockDAG ��� an alternative network structure to Blockchain ��� protocol called PHANTOM. Sompolinsky and Zohar���s 2013 paper on the GHOST protocol introduced the BlockDAG structure ��� which essentially changes Bitcoin���s Blockchain structure into a tree ��� as a way to improve security and speed up transaction times. In a talk at ���Blockchain in Berkeley��� in November 2017, Sompolinsky explained the BlockDAG structure as serving everyone simultaneously. This is in contrast with the structure of Blockchain, in which new blocks are added one at a time once they have been verified.  The PHANTOM paper builds off of the researchers��� SPECTRE protocol, which confirms transactions with recursive voting of previous blocks. However, unlike SPECTRE, PHANTOM will use a ���greedy algorithm��� on a BlockDAG protocol to create a more linear block structure by ���distinguish[ing] between blocks mined properly by honest nodes and those mined by non-cooperating nodes that deviated from the DAG mining protocol.��� The linear structure of PHANTOM means sacrificing the faster confirmation times that came with SPECTRE, although the paper brings up the possibility of combining the two protocols in order to ���enjoy the best of both worlds.��� Although most cryptocurrencies run on a Blockchain protocol, there are several that run on BlockDAG. Byteball is a DAG-based currency in which transactions are linked together and contain hashes of previous transactions. IOTA is also DAG-based ��� the creation of a new transaction must validate at least two previous transactions.	2
Gartman Letter creator and former trader Dennis Gartman has said Bitcoin will trade ���below $5,000��� and that it is ���one of the silliest things in a long time.��� In two appearances on newly Bitcoin-bearish TV network CNBC, Gartman stressed the implausibility of the virtual currency and said he would have no contact or exposure to it. ���I'm very bearish on Bitcoin, I think it's one of the silliest ideas I've heard in a long time," he told its Futures Now segment Saturday. Speaking on Worldwide Exchange previously, Gartman added Bitcoin makes ���no sense whatsoever.��� ���I won't trade it. I won't be long of it. I won't be short of it,��� he announced, failing to see the merits of ���some sort of an asset that has no real asset value behind it.��� The Wall Street veteran���s perspective is typical of the highly critical approach a diminishing number of traditional finance figures continue to hold on Bitcoin. While some of the most famous naysayers have either U-turned or quietened down on the topic, some, including central bank chiefs and even entire governments, maintain that it will evaporate. For its part, while previously adopting a neutral stance on Bitcoin, CNBC recently turned the tables dramatically, publishing practically all warnings about investing in it while championing the alleged benefits of an altcoin, Bitcoin Cash. The network���s Fast Money segment has been especially vocal, its Twitter account causing a stir when it published pro-Bitcoin Cash material some considered was verging on aggressive in nature. #bitcoin closing out 2017 on a .... pic.twitter.com/iSXHLWU0mX	0
Public blockchain platform Nervos Network has announced the mainnet beta launch of Godwoken. The layer-two blockchain protocol integrates Ethereum Virtual Machine capabilities and optimistic rollup mechanics to provide instant transaction finality and low fees within an Ethereum-like environment.  Built upon the existing Nervos layer-one network, the multichain solution seeks to capitalize on Ethereum���s well-documented drawbacks ��� most notably, network congestion, high gas fees and scalability ��� and benefit from the growing importance of layer-two alternative platforms. This long-standing roadmap achievement follows last year���s deployment of Force Bridge, a cross-chain bridge designed to enhance the interoperability of transactions such as those between ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and its layer-one proof-of-work blockchain protocol, Common Knowledge Base. With both Godwoken and Force Bridge now available, the allure for Ethereum developers to transition their decentralized applications (DApp) to Nervos and become early adopters in the expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is rising. Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos, shared his expectations for the future of the project: Nervos has revealed that the Godwoken whitelisting program is now open and accepting applications from DApp projects to convince Ethereum blockchain developers to build upon the ecosystem. Community-based projects scheduled to release in the coming months include YokaiSwap, a mainnet interoperable automated market maker that is expected to facilitate annual percentage yield incentives for yield farmers.	1
Bitcoin has been around the fringes of financial markets for less than a decade, but is slowly gaining prominence as an alternative asset class. Can the government of any major country step in and do the unthinkable ��� ban Bitcoin? Those who think that no government (except those run by tinpot dictators) would take the extreme step of banning Bitcoin need a lesson in history. There was a time when holding gold bullion was a crime in America, punishable by a sentence of up to ten years in prison. In 1933, American President Franklin D Roosevelt issued an order requiring all Americans to hand over their gold holdings to the Federal Reserve Bank. The ban on owning gold remained in place for more than four decades, before President Ford legalized gold ownership. This move was made easy by the fact that America had abandoned the gold standard a short while prior and hence had no need to own vast quantities of gold to back up the amount of currency it printed. Another oft-repeated argument against a ban on Bitcoin is that in the age of the globalized internet economy, individual governments lack the authority and power to act against a decentralized currency like Bitcoin. However, we only have to look at how China has bent even the Internet to realize that this is not the case. By a mix of government legislation and the blocking of popular foreign websites by the Chinese internet service providers, the Chinese government has tried to limit the Chinese to a walled garden, instead of viewing the whole world wide web. Traffic monitoring tools are used by the government to stifle political dissent. Taking a step to ban Bitcoin would not be too large a leap for the Chinese government. If you think that fiat notes, printed by the Government and certified by the Central Bank, would be the last thing to be banned, think again! The Indian Government issued a decree in November 2016, stating that high denomination notes would cease to be legal tender almost immediately. Indian citizens had to queue up in banks to deposit old currency notes. Getting hands on the replacement currency was not easy, leading to huge queues at ATMs. This demonetization was touted as a means to curb income tax evasion and solve most of the government���s problems. Almost a year later, it has become evident that demonetization has failed to achieve the government���s objectives and has only resulted in an increase in the demand for Bitcoins. If a government decides to make trading or possessing Bitcoins illegal, questions will be raised about how exactly it will enforce such a ban. It is impossible for a government to seize your Bitcoins, unless you decide to handover your private keys. However, the majority of citizens and institutions like to stay on the right side of the law. So the demand for Bitcoin would plummet if the government decided to ban it. All exchanges in that country would also be shuttered and buying/selling Bitcoin would be difficult and risky. This would suffocate Bitcoin in that country and the government���s objectives might be achieved.	0
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, posted a sarcastic tweet about the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE). It is not the first time Musk has trolled the crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) communities with humorous remarks. He tweeted ���it���s inevitable,��� with an image showing the ���dogecoin standard��� dwarfing the global financial system.  Elon Musk tweets a Dogecoin meme. Source: Elon Musk Twitter Responding to a sarcastic tweet asking Musk for lost Bitcoin, Musk wrote: ���Excuse me, I only sell Doge!���  The price of DOGE rose by 14% on the day. Source: TradingView.com After Musk���s viral tweet, the price of Dogecoin rose from $0.003052 to $0.003433, by around 14%. Whether DOGE rose as a result of Musk���s tweet cannot be certain. Unlike top cryptocurrencies, DOGE has relatively low liquidity, which leaves it vulnerable to short-term pump and dumps. In recent weeks, a viral TikTok sensation sent the price of Dogecoin surging. Data from CoinMarketCap shows Dogecoin rose from $0.0023 to as high as $0.005 within merely three days from July 6 to 9 as a result. Musk���s tweet appears to be in reference to Dogecoin's sudden increase in popularity in the mainstream. The unexpected spark in interest about the cryptocurrency on TikTok garnered significant media coverage. Throughout the past year, ever since Musk declared that his favorite cryptocurrency is Dogecoin, he has continuously tweeted about crypto.  Musk said in April 2019: ���Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It���s pretty cool.��� In mid-2019, Musk won a poll to become a self-proclaimed CEO of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. That only propelled Musk to write even more sarcastic jokes about cryptocurrencies. In May, in response to J.K. Rowling���s tweet about Bitcoin, Musk wrote:  ���Pretty much, although massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet money look solid by comparison.��� He added: ���I still only own 0.25 Bitcoins btw.��� Musk seemingly enjoys entertaining the crypto industry with the occasional meme tweets. He quite clearly is not a serious investor in cryptocurrencies, unlike the likes of other popular figures such as Paul Tudor Jones. But, there is a silver lining with having arguably one of the most high-profile and influential CEOs in the U.S. tweet about crypto regularly. Cryptocurrencies, as an asset class, still remain as a niche market for many investors. The market capitalization of Bitcoin, the most dominant cryptocurrency in the global market, is smaller than that of Tesla. Dan Tepiero, the founder of DTAP Capital, wrote: ���Not looking like a top in TSLA. In fact, just broke out 7 days ago. At this rate, Elon Musk becomes world's richest person in a few months. The market is always right. What is it telling us about the future? Net worth now equal to 25% of all Bitcoin. Maybe he buys a few?��� For an asset class in an early phase of growth, cryptocurrencies could benefit from the publicity Musk brings to the industry.	1
Blockchain currency is revolutionizing money. Since Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled his cryptocurrency in 2008, we���ve witnessed a proliferation of digital cash companies and codebases. Utilizing his public, distributed ledger, dozens of promising currencies have emerged. Only a select few have proven themselves as true contenders to Bitcoin, however. Here are the top 10 altcoins on CoinMarketCap (note that the list is changing constantly, especially in the tail part, with other altcoins like MaidSafeCoin, Golem and Augur playing musical chairs with others): J.P Morgan Chase, Microsoft and Intel allied in order to create the fiercest rival to Bitcoin in circulation today: Ethereum. The main purpose of the endeavor was to program binding agreements into the Blockchain itself. This incarnated into the now-popular smart contract feature. Interestingly, Ethereum is not just a currency. It���s a Blockchain platform powered by the Ether cryptocurrency. The New York Times describes the technology as ���a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.��� Ripple attracted a great deal of venture capital during its inception. The Google-backed altcoin startup managed to pull in upwards of $50 mln from banking institutions, gathering an impressive $90 mln in total funding. Ripple is unique in that it allows for transacting with any unit of value, from fiat currency to frequent flier miles. ���Ripple provides global financial settlement solutions to enable the world to exchange value like it already exchanges information giving rise to an Internet of Value (IoV). Ripple solutions lower the total cost of settlement by enabling banks to transact directly, instantly and with certainty of settlement,��� reads the company���s copy on their official website. Initially a middling contender, Ripple has gained momentum in the cryptocurrency market, seeing a marked surge earlier this year. In fact, Ripple experienced a 100 percent increase in value within a 24-hour period in late March. Former Google engineer Charles Lee created this altcoin in an effort to improve upon Bitcoin. Namely, the speed to generate a new block is improved dramatically. Transactions are much faster. By the same token, however, this speed makes Litecoin���s Blockchain larger and more prone to producing orphaned blocks. Dash, a combination of the words ���digital��� and ���cash,��� is the Internet���s cash-in-hand. Dash is quick. Its transactions are instant. ���Your time is valuable. InstantSend payments confirm in less than a second,��� Dash claims. By comparison, Bitcoin���s transactions can take up to an hour to process. GPU/CPU mining is no longer cost effective. In order to mine, you���ll need specific hardware, computers known as ASICs to complete Dash���s proof-of-work puzzles. NEM is written in Java; built on an entirely new codebase separate and apart from Bitcoin���s open-source code. There are a few other intriguing differences from Bitcoin as well. In NEM, you harvest rather than mine. It���s essentially the same as mining in Bitcoin, only that multiple people profit - albeit in much smaller quantities - from a generated block. NEM introduced the proof-of-importance algorithm to the digital ledger. A user���s wealth and number of transactions are used to timestamp transactions. NEM has seen rapid growth in its valuation since the beginning of 2017 as the altcoin is currently being embraced in Japan. A parallel Ethereum platform exists and sustains a sizeable usership with a market cap hovering just below $430 mln. Why do two versions of the same platform exist? The Ethereum community fractured when a disagreement over how a technically legal theft of funds should be handled. The majority of users wished to change Ethereum���s code in order to get the lost funds back. A minority believed that Ethereum should not be tampered with or altered by third parties. Even in cases of users exploiting the smart contract feature to trick others, the Blockchain must remain ���immutable.��� Thus, the minority created the Classic version of Ethereum, which still survives and thrives. Monero is geared toward those who desire greater anonymity. The cryptocurrency allows you to ���send and receive funds without your transactions being publically visible on the Blockchain.��� Transactions are completely untraceable due to Monero���s leveraging of ring signatures. Unfortunately, because of Monero���s emphasis on privacy, it has seen adoption by the darknet and other criminal organizations. Zcash, like Monero, offers greater privacy to users. Unlike Monero, transactions are shielded rather than made completely private. Meaning, the details of the transaction itself, such as the users involved and the amount traded, are hidden. Zcash does this by using a ���zero-knowledge��� proof that allows for parties to exchange funds without revealing each other���s identity. Decred���s primary aim is to focus on ���community input, open governance and sustainable funding and development.��� The currency melds proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining algorithms to ensure a minority of users do not own the majority of the funds and that decisions are led by the community rather than a handful of developers or early investors. PIVX stands for Private Instant Verified Transactions. Another open-source decentralized Blockchain currency, it is built upon Bitcoin Core. Like Zcash and Monero, PIVX boasts its heightened privacy and security. ���[W]e believe that you have the right to exchange privately and securely, without interference from corporatocracy pressures, governmental influences, prying eyes, and nefarious individuals and movements,��� PIVX contends. PIVX is highly volatile, experiencing massive spikes in trading volume and valuation as of March of this year. Again, because of the currency���s emphasis on privacy, PIVX is susceptible to criminal activity. Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and the altcoins it has spawned, may bring about a new global economy. They allow us to transact in a peer-to-peer fashion, without third-party bodies governing us. Bitcoin introduced the Blockchain, but other developers are quickly improving upon Nakamoto���s idea. Some currencies have focused on speed, as is the case with both Ripple and Litecoin. Others have honed in on privacy, currencies like Zcash going so far as making all transactions private and untraceable. Each altcoin comes with its own strengths and weakness. Surely, we���ll discover more as time goes on. For now, these 10 currencies are at the top. Their fate could turn, however, at a flip of a coin.	1
Insider activity reports for Coinbase���s COIN stock indicate that multiple early investors and executives sold billions in equity shortly after COIN���s direct listing. While the filings initially indicated that multiple executives sold a high percentage of their stake in the company, a representative for Coinbase told Cointelegraph that the sellers maintain strong ownership positions.  Data from Capital Market Laboratories and confirmed by filings on Coinbase���s Investor Relations website shows a total of 12,965,079 shares were sold by insiders, worth over $4.6 billion at COIN���s $344.38 per share Friday close.  Notable transactions include Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas selling some 255,500 shares at a price of $388.73 (though her Form 4 states that she retains options), while CEO Brian Armstrong sold 749,999 shares in three transactions at various prices, netting a total of $291,827,966.  According to his Form 4 disclosure, after the sale Armstrong retains 300,001 shares worth over $1 billion. In a filing prior to the direct listing however, he was reported to have 36,851,833 shares, indicating that he sold just over 2% of his stake in the company.  this is making the rounds and is so misleading - details matter!each of these execs have tons of unvested options that account for the majority of their holdings - in reality they���ve each sold less than 10% of their total shares https://t.co/LP4uKK1Nuq Capital Market Laboratories' data did not indicate that any directors or insiders purchased additional shares, only sold. The sales can also be seen on OpenInsider's SEC Form 4 screener.  A representative for Coinbase told Cointelegraph that the percentage equity share of each executive is not accurately reported by these reporting services, and that the sales represent only a fraction of the executive and insider ownership.  The reports prompted jeering and amusement on social media, with many observers likening the sales to a classic ���pump and dump��� in which insiders and team members dump tokens into retail liquidity shortly after a listing.  lolol wtf pic.twitter.com/ezZx5F8ua9 While early investors and executives looked to cash in, there are at least a handful of major buyers. Hedge fund manager Cathie Wood is placing a big bet on the exchange, having purchased over $350 million in shares for three different Ark ETFs.  Likewise, many Coinbase employees now have stake in the company, as 1,700 Coinbase staff were gifted 100 shares each as a ���thank you��� from the company.  Earlier this year, Coinbase was embroiled in a string of negative headlines relating to CEO Brian Armstrong's handling of a new policy that restricted focus on political and social issues at work. Armstrong insisted that the company remain "mission focused," and the company's mission includes a goal of becoming ���the leading global brand for helping people convert digital currency into and out of their local currency.���	1
Ethereum developers recently proposed a network change called EIP-1559 ��� a proposal meant to combat the network's rising transaction fees. Expected to take effect in July of this year, the move would send a part of every transaction fee to the Ethereum network itself. Ether allocated in this manner would then be burned, reducing the number of coins in circulation. This change would also decrease the amount of rewards going to the network's miners, leading some to protest the move. A vocal group of participants have since begun to advocate for a demonstrative network takeover, which could threaten the security of the network. The group, however, does not seemingly intend to overthrow Ethereum, insisting that they only desire to show the viability of such an attack. Buterin and other Ethereum developers have since responded by planning defensive efforts. ���The goal of this document is to describe a mechanism by which a merge can happen quickly, with little modification to either the ethpow or beacon clients,��� said Buterin. This move would essentially transition the network to Ethereum 2.0 faster than expected.  ���Like clockwork, the Ethereum community has quickly organized potential solutions to this possible 51% attack, with Vitalik leading the charge,��� a blog post from Status said on March 12, pointing toward the framework written by Buterin. ���Vitalik describes how Ethereum can perform a ���quick merge��� by rapidly moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake with limited changes required to Ethereum clients,��� the post said.  A miner known as "Bits Be Trippin" commented during a March 9 YouTube video that, "Part of the risk display here is not to attack the network, it's to show that force projection is possible."  Ethereum 2.0 is a scaling effort that looks to take the network from proof-of-work, or PoW, to a proof-of-stake, or PoS, mining consensus ��� an endeavor that has been in the works for years.  Buterin's recently proposed framework would expedite the network���s mining consensus transition, choosing to work out the kinks and details of the system after the fact, the Status post detailed. The merge could pave the way for smoother development on Ethereum 2.0, according to the post and Buterin���s write-up.  The Status blog noted that the EIP-1559 opposition group have already technically mustered enough power to conduct their 51% attack, based on the group���s web page at the time of the blog post.  Ethereum���s network has been home to many significant developments in both the decentralized finance and nonfungible token arenas over the past year. As the number of platforms and assets running on the Ethereum network have grown, however, so too have the network's transaction fees.  Ethereum initiated Eth2 in December 2020, with the launch of its beacon chain.	2
US mainstream media network CNBC has caused a stir after airing a step-by-step tutorial on how to buy Ripple on Poloniex. In what would previously have been an unlikely format for the broadcaster, host Brian Kelly used screens of the Poloniex order book to guide consumers through the process of specifically acquiring Ripple���s XRP token. He then performed a live spot trade in which he converted around three BTC to XRP. ���I���ve bought all that Ripple - that���s how easy and fast it is,��� Kelly commented. Lol @CNBC is showing people how to use the internet to buy Ripple. Literally click-by-click tutorial followed by ���that���s how easy it is!���   This is so insane. pic.twitter.com/8uzt0YP5Po While the edition of CNBC���s Fast Money segment is conspicuous for its arguably promotional rather than informative nature, it is not the first time the network has chosen to overtly ���plug��� a certain cryptocurrency. In December, the sudden appearance of pro-Bitcoin Cash content both on air and on social media accounts raised significant suspicions from the cryptocurrency community. XRP���s astronomical price rise has meanwhile likewise given rise to concerns from those unconvinced by the utility of the token versus the platform itself. Ripple businesses are not required to invest in XRP. Nonetheless, CEO Brad Garlinghouse remains adamant its use as a currency will deal a blow to Bitcoin, a perspective mainstream publications other than CNBC have since jumped on. ���A lot for the speculation that���s gone on about XRP lately is people realizing Bitcoin is not going to be the kind of panacea of all things Blockchain we once thought it would be,��� Garlinghouse told NBC. ���Instead you���re having vertical specific. XRP is solving a payments problem and it���s very efficient to do that.���	1
The traditional diversified portfolio of investments will have a host of assets in varying risk brackets, but for a traditional investment, officer cryptocurrencies could seem too speculative to be part of any portfolio with a wealth preservation focus. The caveat is that while not all cryptocurrencies are guaranteed to stick around forever, there are still profits to be made by a savvy investor that chooses a long term winner early on. An investment officer from Credo Wealth, Deon Gouws, is personally interested in digital currencies, but as chief investment officer for a traditional financial institution, is understandably nervous. He says: "Most cryptocurrencies we see launching today are likely to fail, but there���s still a lot of money to be made if you can identify the long-term winners successfully and early.��� Mike Novogratz, a well-known investor who has been bullish on Bitcoin for some time now, has made statements indicating agreement. He has called the asset a bubble, but one where there is money to be made. Novogratz said: ���This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes. Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.��� As the cryptocurrency space has evolved, prices have risen astronomically with the influx of interest from the mainstream market. Those who have joined the space in recent times have seen the likes of Bitcoin build to as high as $20,000. However, those who have joined this space in their droves have clearly done for the profiteering that has taken place, and the promise of more to come. This then means that there is more of a diluted core of users who are in it to see the technology thrive and flourish. In turn, this not only adds to the speculative nature of the market but also to the bubble-nature that Novogratz refers to. The entire crypto space may not be as prone to a big collapse, or a catastrophic failure like some flimsy ICOs, but there are still concerns for those looking for pure profit. The real issue in the market being flooded with people in it to make a quick buck is that the potentially revolutionary technology can be pushed towards bubble technology. It is not the product that is prone to being in a bubble. It is the way in which it is used or perceived that leads to bubbles being formed and popped. The dot-com bubble has shown a lot of similarities to Bitcoin���s rapid growth, but that does not mean dot-com businesses or digital businesses, are always going to be bubbles. And the same applies to Bitcoin. In the dot-com boom, people were entering the market to make money, and they were throwing money at anything with .com on the end. It is happening today too, with Bitcoin and Blockchain, but that does not mean a bubble is a definite. If people continue to flood the cryptocurrency market intent on only making money off it, rather than appreciating it as a new wave of technology, then Gouws��� opinion may be spot on. People will enter have a direct say in which way something like this moves, with their speculative investing. There needs to be a concerted push to appreciate the technology, and adopt it for mainstream uses if Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are to be a long term success.	1
Would you bet $1 mln that Bitcoin will hit $50,000 by the end of 2018? According to data from LedgerX, a market for Bitcoin derivatives, one investor has already done just that, purchasing nearly $1 mln in Bitcoin options with a $50,000 call.  What such a bet means is that if this time next year the price is less than $50,000, the options will be worthless and the owner will lose the full $1 mln investment. However, if Bitcoin���s price exceeds $50,000 by next December, the owner of the options will have the right to buy 275 Bitcoins for $50,000 a coin, for a total transaction of about $13.8 mln. Depending on by how much the price exceeds $50,000 a year from now, the bet could potentially be very lucrative. Although some investors have predicted BTC will eventually reach $1 mln a coin, they remain vague about when exactly. While unwilling to disclose who placed the options, LedgerX CEO Paul Chou indicated the investor was likely an institution, saying: ���Without a doubt, there are institutions out there that are looking at these types of trades or have done these types of trades. It���s not an individual, let���s put it that way.��� The inclusion of derivatives provides a number of advantages for the Bitcoin market but also opens the door for highly risky trades. Jeff Mahony, CEO of UbiquiCoin told Cointelegraph: "Derivatives markets are generally favorable for the underlying securities because they provide the opportunity for more sophisticated institutional investors to enter the market, which generally increases price stability. However, it also creates the opportunity for significantly more speculation and the risk of investors trying to ���swing for the fences��� based on speculation rather than fundamental analysis.���	2
While in terms of market capitalization Bitcoin Cash is still playing catch up with Bitcoin, in terms of trading volume Bitcoin-Cash has overtaken Bitcoin and currently, its trading volume is 20 percent over Bitcoin ($3.1 bln vs. $2.6 bln). South Korea is the one country which is driving increased trading volumes of BCH. Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit account for $1.7 bln out of the $3.1 bln (55 percent of total volume) BCH trading volumes. The increase in the USD price of BCH (From $300 a week back to over $800 currently) has also resulted in the USD value of BCH trades going up. Unlike other countries where Bitcoin Cash is traded primarily against Bitcoin, in Korea BCH is primarily traded against the Korean Won. South Korean exchanges were amongst the earliest to announce support for BCH trading and did so even before the actual hard fork and creation of Bitcoin Cash. Given that BCH is relatively new and fiat-BCH trading is not that well established, most people who want to buy BCH use BTC to buy it. Hence the demand for BCH results in higher BTC volumes as well. Out of the $2.6 bln BTC trading volumes,  approximately 30 percent is contributed by BTC-BCH trading at various exchanges (Bittrex, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Huobi, HitBTC, etc.). When the BCH-Fiat market develops further, it could result in BTC trading volumes declining as well. Currently, the increase in Bitcoin Cash price has resulted in mining BCH becoming more profitable than mining BTC. It has also generated substantial interest and is driving trading volumes. The uncertainty around SegWit2x and the prospect of another fork on BTC has also resulted in some people shifting to BCH. Transaction volumes have increased in BCH, with a single block clearing over 37,000 transactions. Currently, BCH has played the role of an altcoin killer and has not cannibalized the value of BTC. If the scaling prospects of BTC get stalled again, then a lot more people could shift to BCH from Bitcoin.	2
The views expressed here are the author���s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com 2017 was a breakthrough year for the crypto market for major coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, increasing awareness by the mainstream market, and innovative new applications of Blockchain technology drove impressive returns. More importantly, this blistering pace for the entire ecosystem is being driven by increasing appetite on the side of investors, with no sign of abating. The breakneck speed at which the crypto market has expanded over the past year has not been without its hiccups and a fair share of skeptics. For many veterans, the current craze for cryptocurrencies resembles the madness of the late 90s and the heyday of the Dot-com bubble. Trading volatility over the past few months hasn���t helped the rising voices of speculation. That Bitcoin crashed by nearly half its value in a single day, or that this isn���t the only similar incident, prove that massive price swings are still a major concern, and the market is incredibly unstable. Others, however, counter that even if the industry were to face a bubble, it could lead to a more mature and innovative market. David Stockman, Ronald Reagan���s former director of the Office of Management: "It's basically a class of really stupid speculators who have convinced themselves that trees grow to the sky. It will burn out in a spectacular crash. All of these latter-day speculators will have their hands burned to a crisp, and they will learn the proper lesson." As pretenders are weeded out, observers argue that the sector will stabilize, and continue expanding at a more measured pace. Jeffrey Kleintop, chief strategist of Charles Schwab: ���...I think the Bitcoin bubble if you want to call it that, is something different. If Bitcoin prices were to plunge suddenly, because it's so independent from the financial system, it's kind of its own thing. It hasn't yet become embedded in the economy and the financial structure.��� Even so, the debate is not entirely black-and-white. The crypto ecosystem has shown signs of being in a bubble���disproportionate valuations for companies without actual products, an alarming rate of new ICOs, increasing numbers of scams and failed launches���but has also shown signs of a more stable future. Marianne Lake, chief financial officer at JPMorgan: ���We are very open-minded to the potential use cases in future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated.��� Major coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are slowly entering the financial mainstream as traditional exchanges increasingly offer related instruments, and merchants begin to accept more cryptocurrencies as payments. Nevertheless, the question remains a valid one���is the crypto market simply booming or is it finally growing up? There are several indications that the crypto ecosystem could be in the midst of a massive bubble. The situation has repeatedly been compared to the Dot-com bubble, and in some cases, the similarities are plain to see. Driven by the excitement of a new, potentially revolutionary technology, investors ponied up millions in funding to companies that promised the sky but largely failed to deliver anything.  The Dot-com bubble  [Image: Business Insider] The 90s were about the rise of the Internet, and the current market is based around Blockchain, the architecture underlying most cryptocurrencies. The market capitalization for cryptocurrencies continues to hover closer to the $1 tln mark, despite wild swings that have pushed it between $700 and $800 bln over the past few months.  Image: Coinmarketcap Moreover, the current boom in crypto valuations has been driven in large part by a completely unregulated ecosystem. It seems to reward the flashiest assets, even when their practical applications may be dubious at best. This is clear in the outsized capital many Blockchain-based companies have raised. In the second quarter of 2017 alone, ICOs raised nearly $800 mln in funding, with the first six months yielding $1.3 bln in capital. Individually, the largest cryptocurrencies have all reached valuations that were not even contemplated just one year ago. Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has soared over 1,700 percent in the last 12 months, skyrocketing from slightly over $800 to nearly hit $20,000 before settling lower. Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum have all seen similar trajectories in 2017, and indications point to continued growth. The signs of a bubble are there, and this current boom seems unsustainable. However, the reality may prove slightly different, for a variety of reasons. Recent volatility across the board, led by a crash in Ripple���s valuation following South Korea���s alleged announcement for a cryptocurrency trading ban, shows that the industry is susceptible to massive swings.  Image: Coinmarketcap Even so, dips have historically been followed by upward corrections over recent months, showing the market���s staying power. Even as cries of a bubble get louder, the crypto market has actually trended in the direction of maturation. For one, governments are starting to recognize cryptocurrencies potential and embrace them in some ways. Japan recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method in 2017 as well as certifying several cryptocurrency exchanges to operate within its borders. Russia announced plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the CryptoRuble, and even Venezuela has revealed plans to launch its own coin. Others have started to regulate the crypto market, offering hope that increased stability will lead to greater adoption. The EU and several Asian countries have enacted new laws to bring some order to the market. Even in the US, major exchanges have started offering Bitcoin futures as tools for more institutional investment participation. Dennis Gartman, economist and commodity analyst, The Gartman Letter editor: "It [cryptocurrency] is gaining some sense of legitimacy by the Cboe. ...When they [cryptocurrencies holders] begin to pay taxes on it, when it ceases to be an avenue for avoiding taxes, when it ceases to be a place where drug dealers are trading and making transactions, then I'll be interested." More importantly, however, businesses and entrepreneurs have embraced Blockchain, the market���s underlying technology, creating a thriving ecosystem of applications and services. Companies are finding better ways to utilize Blockchain's capabilities, instead of relying on cryptocurrencies' speculative gains. Already, several companies have introduced solutions that improve on several traditional business activities, from creating better agreements���companies such as Jincor, which offers simple smart contract creation���to giving consumers better access to services like financing and cloud storage. Blockchain startups like Cryptopay are facilitating payments with cryptocurrencies, while others like SelfKey are focused on creating better forms of identification for individuals. Moreover, in the financial sphere, businesses like Legolas are improving wealth management and investment platforms. These applications are quickly gaining popularity, and new companies are finding diverse ways to migrate their services to this architecture. However, many have natural barriers, as Blockchain requires a new round of development and hires. Currently, most companies still rely on Ethereum���s ERC-20 protocol and smart contracts to build new applications, but that paradigm is still dev-heavy. Instead, some companies have already shown better pathways to developing Blockchain-based apps. This nascent sector has already shown promise, and new applications are further expanding the ecosystem. Qtum, for example, provides a hybrid infrastructure for developers to build Blockchain applications that are suitable for operating with the major Blockchains, while also compatible with mobile and IoT services. The company���s dual architecture is based on Bitcoin Core and Ethereum Virtual Machine to allow for the use of smart contracts across platforms. The end-deliverable is a lighter-weight product with cross-chain functionality that outmatches Ethereum���s capabilities while broadening Blockchain���s appeal. The company has shown significant promise and caught investors��� attention, rewarding the valuation with a near 200 percent leap higher in December 2017.     Image: Coinmarketcap Most importantly, however, cryptocurrencies are beginning to find real use cases. Ripple has been successful in carving a niche in banking and business-to-business transactions. Bitcoin Cash promises to solve many of Bitcoin���s shortcomings as a payment method, namely scaling and transaction speed. Meanwhile, Ethereum has proven its worth as an infrastructure for application development. Even with the high volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the overarching trend in 2017 has been overwhelmingly positive. As the industry becomes more widely accepted, it could help significantly stabilize the recent wave of volatility. There are signs that the crypto market is still rather unstable, including sky-high valuations and a rapid pace of growth that has rivaled manias of the past, but 2017 still closed on a strong note. However, success in the next year will rely heavily on broader adoption. And a market that can withstand speculation waves. Should Bitcoin valuations remain highly volatile, investors and exchanges will eventually be scared off, and trading may decrease. The recent extreme swings experienced by the broader market highlights how precarious the current boom is.  Chart showing the Bitcoin price movement since 2013 2018 is promising to be a momentous year for the industry. As fears of a bubble collapse increase, many are looking at it optimistically. In their eyes, the ecosystem is ripe for a cleaning, and removing underperformers and unsustainable projects could enable the real contenders to grow. Moreover, a wave of consolidation and the entry of institutional investment into the sphere could lead to broader adoption and a more stable market. Though the crypto market is growing, it must show sustainability and deliver better fungibility. As more companies demonstrate effective uses for cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology, the overall ecosystem should continue to stabilize and expand as awareness of its inherent benefits improves.

ICPunks has announced the release of 10,000 nonfungible tokens (NFT) on the Internet Computer. Users are eligible to claim their free token Wednesday at 8 pm UTC. Conceptualized by brothers Przemek and Tomasz Chojecki, alongside Adam St��pnik, the trio was inspired to create the avatars following acronym comparisons to the 1990s hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse and the overwhelming success of the legendary CryptoPunk NFTs. Following a series of exclusive early releases, it is expected that only 3,000 punks will be available to claim, one per user, at the time of release.  Cointelegraph spoke to Przemek, a co-founder of the project, about his expectations for the NFT drop: The Internet Computer a general purpose blockchain that enables smart contracts to serve interactive web content directly to users. Alternatives to popular social media networks, including LinkedIn, Medium, WhatsApp, as well as community-driven sites such as Reddit have already been created by community members. According to a recent tweet, the ICPunk drop has garnered notable attention from the crypto community, with analytical data reporting 89,000 visitors to the NFT website since it went live.  We also spoke to Tomasz about the recent Dfinity partnership: The NFT market has recorded exceptional growth over the past year following an illustrious list of reputable brands, celebrities and public figures contributing to the space. Last week, Cointelegraph reported that credit card giant Visa made a statement NFT purchase of a $150,000 CryptoPunk. This week, Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka announced a collection of NFT tokens in the lead-up to the US Open championships.	1
Today, Jan. 4, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) released a warning  for Main Street investors regarding the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The warning was promptly followed by a statement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that commended and reiterated the NASAA���s message. The NASAA statement encouraged investors to look ���beyond the hype��� when considering cryptocurrencies and their derivatives, in order to better understand the associated risks. Joseph P. Borg, NASAA President and Director of the Alabama Securities Commission, was quoted in the statement saying: ���Investors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptocurrency futures contracts and other financial products where these virtual currencies are linked in some way to the underlying investment.��� Borg also noted in the statement that the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market attracts new investors who are generally not well-informed about the nature of the investments they are making, stating: ���The recent wild price fluctuations and speculation in cryptocurrency-related investments can easily tempt unsuspecting investors to rush into an investment they may not fully understand.��� The NASAA statement includes a list of common concerns associated with cryptocurrencies and warnings of high potential for fraud when investing in them. The NASAA and the SEC made a point of describing how cryptocurrencies are different from ���traditional���, or fiat, currencies. Both agencies noted that it is these very differences that make cryptocurrencies high risk. The NASAA statement reads: ���Unlike traditional currency, these alternatives have no physical form and typically are not backed by tangible assets. They are not insured or controlled by a central bank or other governmental authority, cannot always be exchanged for other commodities, and are subject to little or no regulation.��� Finally, the statement concludes with a list of five potential signs of fraud when investing in the crypto space. These fraud red flags include ���guaranteed��� high returns, unlicensed sellers, and high pressure to buy rapidly, all of which were arguably present in most ICOs in 2017. The SEC affirmation of the NASAA statement -- along with the several other SEC statements on crypto and ICOs - is indicative of an increasing, concentrated focus on regulating the crypto space, particularly in the US. As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow and public attention increases, the potential risks for new, uninformed investors will likely continue to spur on regulation and warnings from governmental authorities around the world.	0
Researchers at the University of New South Wales have revealed an architectural structure that solves some of the stability issues that are facing quantum computing scientists, according to a recent report. The new architecture, which the report compared in significance to landing a man on the Moon, utilizes currently available processors to organize how each ���spin qubit��� is kept stable and interacts with those around it. By building a grid of silicon transistors to control the spin and interaction of each qubit (qubits are the building block of a quantum computer), the researchers have been able to stabilize interactions between them, the sticking point of quantum computing to date. The author, Menno Veldhorst, says: "By selecting electrodes above a qubit, we can control a qubit's spin, which stores the quantum binary code of a 0 or 1. And by selecting electrodes between the qubits, two-qubit logic interactions, or calculations, can be performed between qubits.��� While the research moves the technology forward, the report indicates that there is still more to do to create a commercially viable technology. According to researchers at Carnegie Mellon, quantum computing could theoretically be used to break through the encryption mechanism of Blockchain technology, putting the security of the network at risk. The risks associated with the quantum computing, however, are somewhat distant, potentially giving researchers time to build encryption ���patches��� that will handle the quantum computing risks.	2
A recent report from the joint Bitcoin analysis team of FDD and Ellicit, a Bitcoin forensics company, indicates that less than one percent of all Bitcoin transactions involve money laundering. The report, written to help analyze the flow of funds and the danger of money laundering, has indicated that money laundering isn���t nearly the problem some critics of cryptocurrency believe. The report states: ���The amount of observed Bitcoin laundering [is] small and darknet marketplaces such as Silk Road and, later, AlphaBay are [generally] the source of almost all of the illicit Bitcoins laundered through conversion services.��� The report also indicates that the vast majority of illicit transactions using Bitcoin were processed in Europe, receiving more than five times as many illicit transactions as North America. The report suggests that the best way to combat such illicit activity is through more stringent anti-money laundering (AML) measures. The report states that the only way to manage the illicit transaction is for ���Financial authorities in all jurisdictions [to] increase AML enforcement.���	2
Leading crypto exchanges are holding around 1.36 million Bitcoin (BTC), worth around $12,880,000,000. The last time major trading firms had such low Bitcoin reserves, the price of the dominant cryptocurrency surged from $3,150 to $14,000. Market data indicates a growing number of investors are moving their Bitcoin holdings out of exchanges, showing that traders have no intention of selling BTC at the current price of $9,400.  Top crypto exchanges record 1-year low Bitcoin reserves. Source: CQ Live In the first quarter of last year, the price of Bitcoin ranged between $3,150 and $4,500 for nearly four months. When the inflow of BTC from exchanges started to decline, the cryptocurrency began to rally. Within three months, BTC increased from $4,000 to $14,000, recording a 250% price surge. At $9,500, Bitcoin is seeing the same BTC inflow volume into exchanges seen in early 2019. Fewer traders are depositing Bitcoin to trading platforms, which shows investors have no interest in risking their BTC to sell in the $9,500 to $10,000 range. The 12-month low inflow of BTC into top cryptocurrency exchanges coincides with long-term indicators signaling the start of a new uptrend. Macro indicators like the golden cross and the Puell Multiple show that Bitcoin is on the verge of a major bull run as seen at the start of 2019. The Puell Multiple is a metric that considers the circulating supply by looking into miner revenue to measure if BTC is overbought or oversold. Currently, the Puell Multiple of BTC is hovering at 0.4. In mid-December 2019, when Bitcoin was at $3,150, it dropped to as low as 0.3. The supply-focused metric shows Bitcoin could see another minor pullback in the short term. But in the short to medium-term, Bitcoin is expected to see a sizable rally.  Puell Multiple shows Bitcoin is nearing oversold levels. Source: LookIntoBitcoin Bitcoin also recently recorded its seventh golden cross in history. Three out of the past six golden crosses led to a massive long-term rally.  A golden cross occurs when two long-term exponential moving average lines cross one another. This typically happens when BTC is recovering rapidly from a steep sell-off. Bitazu Capital founding partner Mohit Sorout said: We recently witnessed the 7th Golden CrossOx of bitcoin's existence. Previous 3 out of 6 led to gigantic rallies. But sure any tool without a 100% win rate is a meme, must be shunned & discarded immediately.  Bitcoin sees its seventh golden cross in history. Source: Mohit Sorout The ongoing rally of Bitcoin is fundamentally and structurally different from previous rallies seen in the last two years. This time around, there are a significantly higher number of retail investors and institutions leading the upsurge of Bitcoin rather than investors in the futures market that trade with high leverage. With a lower risk of a major long squeeze, long-term macro indicators hinting at a major uptrend in the coming months are considered a positive factor for the medium-term price trend of Bitcoin.	2
Tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban has recently stated that Bitcoin is facing a bubble. However, Daniel M. Harrison, the CEO of DMH&CO and managing partner of Monkey Capital, reveals that such a thing is impossible due to the market-influencing capabilities of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The main factor that makes a digital bubble impossible is market bipolarity. For many people, market bipolarity is confusing but it can be distilled in a few important and understandable viewpoints. Apparently, market bipolarity is directly affected by George Soros��� ���theory of reflexivity.��� According to George Soros, market conditions are not influenced by equilibrium. Rather, they are ���reflexive��� due to the synchronization of two functions: cognitive and manipulative function. The cognitive function is a neutral thinking base - this is where economic participants assess facts for what they are. The manipulative function, on the other hand, turns one fact (or a couple of facts) in order to gain an advantage. Once the cognitive mind is affected by the manipulative mind, the neutrality will be ���painted��� in a different light it becomes a manipulated fact. Therefore, markets reflect the view and perspective of participants, not the full scope of economics. The situation can be represented in two ways: The aforementioned equations show that a manipulative thinking pattern is the usual baseline and not a cognitive function. This shows the reflexive nature of all markets one of the clear indicators that Bitcoin and Ethereum are far from experiencing a digital bubble. More importantly, Ethereum and Bitcoin markets are influenced by two thinkers: artificial and natural. Artificial pertains to the Blockchain AI and natural is all about human intervention. Many experts think that Blockchain is adopting an "economic mindset." If markets with manipulative and cognitive participants are suddenly annexed, it will always result in reflexivity or positive feedback loops. In this case, digital markets are bound by reflexivity or states of reflexivity. This is a self-perpetuating situation that can go on for many years. It���s also important to know that artificial thinkers are the ���igniters��� of self-perpetuating reflexivity. With AI (Blockchain), digital markets will continue to thrive, leading to fluctuating values of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market bipolarity will always be constant. Through market bipolarity, any episode of a digital bubble is canceled out. The whole Blockchain system will never return to its ���roots��� but it will continue evolving. Price valuations, on the other hand, may remain grounded and directed by economic factors. Innovation or its application in various sectors is also another important factor that shapes Blockchain technology���s tenacity and ability to survive a ���bubble.���	2
Ripple (XRP), currently the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has continued its recent rally, crossing the $3 per coin mark. At press time, the altcoin was trading at an average of $3.12. Ripple���s price has increased almost 49,000 percent over the past twelve months. The cryptocurrency passed $2 just last week, seeing a 130% increase since Dec 27. This has cemented Ripple���s number two position with a market cap of $121 bln, almost half that of Bitcoin.  Ripple markets itself as a Blockchain-based payment solution for enterprise level global payment transactions. The addition of the coin on Bloomberg's price terminal in mid-December arguably started the substantial rally. A recent ���cryptocurrency mania��� on South Korean market, during which almost half of Ripple trading volumes occurred several multiple exchanges in the country, has also contributed to the altcoin���s rise. Investors and cryptocurrency believers have been pursuing other altcoins recently as well, creating substantial gains in the top 30. The most notable gains include Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (XLM), which have both jumped more than 30% on the day, as well as Status (SNT), which saw an over 100 percent increase in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, on Jan. 3 BTC dominance (percentage of total market capitalization) hit a new record low of 34.6 percent.	2
Local news agency Yonhap reports that South Korean government has announced Monday, Jan. 22 that it will be collecting a 22 percent corporate tax and a 2.2 percent local income tax from the country���s cryptocurrency exchanges. The tax announcement comes right after the conclusion of an unprecedented anti-money laundering probe into six major South Korean banks that showed a 36 times increase in commissions from virtual accounts linked to crypto exchanges, from 61 mln won ($57,340) in 2016 to 2.2 bln won ($2 mln) in 2017. Yonhap reports that South Korean exchange Bithumb made 317.6 bln won ($295,368,000) last year in total, so is expected to pay about 60 mln won in taxes, according to the tax percentages announced Monday. The announced tax percentages are in line with the South Korean tax code for all corporations that make a yearly income of over 20 bln won ($18.7 mln). Bithumb, which is the largest exchange globally at $2.85 bln daily trading volume as of press time, was hacked in February 2017, losing about $7 mln in mostly Bitcoin and Ether. This security breach, along with several other breaches of South Korean exchanges, has recently been more definitively linked to North Korean hackers. The South Korean government has recently been stepping up enforcement of cryptocurrency regulation within the country. Besides ordering the financial probe, the government has banned the use of anonymous virtual accounts, frozen the opening of new virtual accounts, and forbid underage and foreign users from trading on exchanges. The South Korean public has fought back with a petition to stop the recent government regulations. After reaching the necessary 200,000 signatures, the petition is currently awaiting an official response from the government.	0
Nick Colas, the first Wall Street brokerage analyst to cover Bitcoin (BTC) extensively, has urged investors to think twice before entering the crypto market, despite the market���s recent rally, in an interview with CNBC May 4. Colas has a well established reputation among Wall Street professionals, having authored Convergex���s popular Morning Markets Briefing for 14 years. He refuted the idea that in the wake of the market���s early year crash, now could be an opportune moment for investors to get in: ���A lot of people [are] asking [whether] now [is] the right time to buy, and the short answer is no, for two fundamental reasons. The first is we���re not seeing a lot of incremental engagement from people interested in buying Bitcoin for the first time, and like any new technology you need new adopters to come in to make it more valuable. And in terms of Google searches, they are way down from the peaks back in December and January, [by] 85 to 90 percent��� Colas added that he was concerned that there is now relatively little wallet growth, with only 2.2 percent more people opening Bitcoin wallets to purchase the cryptocurrency last month, as opposed to the 5-7 percent monthly growth that was recorded during all of last year. When asked whether last year���s soaring market valuations were evidence that Bitcoin is indeed a bubble, Colas responded: ���Certainly in retrospect it was absolutely a bubble based around the Futures launch in December ��� [I���ve covered Bitcoin] since 2013, [I] fundamentally believe in the structure of the technology and the story, but it obviously has huge price volatility around it, and we���ve seen that even in the past month with [the market] rallying as much as it has.��� Colas���s circumspect tone as to whether mainstream adoption can become a reality anytime soon sets his argument apart from other crypto investment perspectives, which can often seem hopelessly polarized between either the diehard skeptics or the exuberant Bitcoin bulls.	0
A man who knows a few things about the power of social and individuals, Mark Zuckerberg, has stated that he will be studying cryptocurrencies further in order to explore their potential for empowering individuals. The co-founder of Facebook, in what he has called one of his personal challenges for the new year, has stated that the power of decentralized systems like cryptocurrency could help take power away from the centralized system and place it back in the hands of individuals. Lauded as an innovator and one of the fathers of social media, Zuckerberg has shown his fascination with cryptocurrencies before, but this latest New Year���s post has indications that he will be investigating its potential much further for potential improvement for Facebook. Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post: "There are important counter-trends to this ��� like encryption and cryptocurrency ��� that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands...I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services." There have already been a number of social media platforms based around Blockchain service; however, the firepower of a company like Facebook, which reaches over one bln people on a daily basis investigating cryptocurrencies could be monumental. Zuckerberg���s overarching message in the post which made mention of cryptocurrencies was based around ���fixing important issues in technology, media and government.��� And, indeed, a technology like Blockchain is being heralded as revolutionary within those fields and with the backing of such an institution, there could be scope for rocketing growth in adoption and recognition for cryptocurrencies. It is unsurprising to see why Zuckerberg would be interested in a decentralized system when you inspect social media for its peer-to-peer power. While there is a centralized force on Facebook, it has given individuals a lot of power and a much bigger voice. A decentralized system like cryptocurrencies can only aid that growth further, and as Zuckerberg states - ���put it [power] back into people���s hands.��� Well-known Software Engineer Jameson Lopp explains how, in a monetary space, cryptocurrencies have flipped conventional centralized thinking on its head. ���At least from the monetary standpoint, we said let's turn this whole thing upside down. Instead of us trusting certain entities, instead, we are going to track everything ourselves, validate our rules and not trust anybody.��� Be it media, social media, finance, investing or any other sector, the traditionalists and the early innovators turning to cryptocurrencies, even to learn, could be the start of something big.	2
Even though cryptocurrencies are getting more and more exposure, their legislation seems to be a grey area for most governments, especially when it comes to declaring your income in digital currencies. The Internal Revenue Service, the US tax collection agency, has issued Notice 2014-21 stating that Bitcoin and altcoins are subjects to federal income and payroll taxes. So what to do with your crypto money and how to declare your taxes right? Let���s start with the dreary subject of records. Yes, that applies to crypto investors too. You���d better have some if you are thinking about taxes. If you���ve ever tried to tell the IRS ���I lost my receipt,��� you don���t want to do it a second time. The IRS has heard every excuse in the book. While it is not without sympathy, you���ll find it far easier not having to go to the additional effort of proving something by another means. Periodically, the IRS issues reminders to taxpayers regarding the importance of safeguarding your tax records. That���s especially true in cases of natural disasters that make traditional record-keeping go haywire. But think of it year-round wherever you are. The IRS suggests creating a backup set of records stored away from the originals. It is good advice for crypto investors. If you are sitting on some big gains, you might consider how your tax picture will look for the entire year. It isn���t too soon to start thinking this way. In fact, try to do it long before year-end so you can make adjustments. You might want to sell or hedge some, even if you think the market is still headed up. There is a lot more than taxes involved in such decisions. But it can be wise to at least think about it. For example, what if your tax year already has a big capital loss in it, or you have a big carryover loss from prior years? In general, unused capital losses can be used to absorb up to $3,000 per year in ordinary income. But unless you have capital gains to offset your capital losses that $3,000 would be the extent of your tax benefit. Some people sit for years and years with unused capital losses that carryover each year. So, if you also have unrealized capital gains, you might consider selling some gain assets, to be able to absorb your losses. Run some numbers and see how it looks. Another topic as tax time nears is to ask whether you really know what you are selling. That is, if you have 100 Bitcoins and you sell 10, which 10 did you sell? There is no perfect answer to this question. Most of the tax law considers shares of stock, not cryptocurrency.   However, many advisers think that the same kinds of rules should be applied in the case of multiple crypto assets that you hold. If so, specific identification of what you are selling, when you bought it, and for what purchase price, is likely to be the cleanest. But that may not be possible. Some people use an averaging convention, where you essentially average your cost across a number of purchases. Consistency and record-keeping are important. You don���t want the IRS to claim that you denied the government its fair share of each sale. And remember, if you are claiming long-term capital gain treatment, being able to prove that you held the cryptocurrency for more than a year before selling is key. Loaning money shouldn���t be a taxable event to either the borrower or the lender, except for interest payments. So, can you loan out your cryptocurrency to people? You can, but the question is whether that loan will be treated the same as a loan of money by the IRS. The jury is still out on that question. The IRS says cryptocurrency is property for tax purposes. You don���t want the loan and the repayment (of different cryptocurrency?) to be treated as taxable dispositions. Some of it may depend on your documents, and how much you make it look and feel like a real loan. Hedges of cryptocurrency are another hot topic to consider. Hedges can help to avoid some of the volatility that has characterized the various crypto markets. But be careful that you are doing your best to avoid a disposition, meaning a sale for tax purposes, that you don���t want. The holidays may be over, but probably everyone in your family would still like some Bitcoin or other crypto issues. The prices have been so ever-present in the news, that gifts and donations are still very much in the news. But is it smart tax-wise? A charitable contribution would be the best type of transfer. If you give to a qualified charity, you should get an income tax deduction for the full fair market value of the crypto. If you bought for $500, and donate to a 501(c)(3) charity when it is worth $15,000, you should get a $15,000 charitable contribution deduction. What���s more, you won���t have to pay the capital gain tax on the $14,500 spread. Giving to private parties is not as impressive. The same gift to your niece gets you no tax deduction. And it requires you to file a gift tax return since the gift is worth more than $15,000. For 2018, $15,000 is the amount of so-called ���annual exclusion��� gifts you can give to any number of people each year with no reporting required. Any gifts over that $15,000 amount require a gift tax return, even though you probably won���t pay any gift tax. You normally would use up a small portion of your lifetime exclusion from gift and estate tax. For 2018, that number just went up dramatically. The amount you can transfer tax-free during your life or on death just went up to $11.2 mln per person. That is $22.4 mln per married couple. Finally, don���t forget about the coming onslaught of IRS Forms 1099. Normally, these not-so-fun little tax forms arrive around the end of January, reporting income paid to you in the previous calendar tax year. The IRS says that wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable, must be reported on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes. Similarly, payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors are taxable to them, and payers who are engaged in business must issue Form 1099. A payment made using virtual currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting just like any other payment made in property. That means if a person in business pays virtual currency worth $600 or more to an independent contractor for services, Form 1099 is required. If you are a recipient of Form 1099, as most everyone is, keep track of them. Each one gets reported to the IRS and applicable state tax authorities. If you don���t report or otherwise address the reported income on your tax return, you can expect that the IRS will follow up. This may seem confusing, but you shouldn���t worry. The IRS is usually much more lenient to those who fill in taxes, even with mistakes, rather than to those who avoid doing it at all.	1
Betting has long been a favorite pastime for sports fanatics and that fervor has spilled over into the world of cryptocurrencies. Whether you like to bet on results or enjoy the thrill of spot betting on chance occurrences, there is plenty on offer for the avid gambler. The NFL playoffs are already underway, but it���s not too late to stand a chance to win some Bitcoin during the business-end of the American football season. There is no denying the hype surrounding NFL, especially when we near the Super Bowl which in recent years has garnered no less than 100 mln viewers. So it really is a no-brainer that marrying NFL with the likes of Bitcoin, which was the second most searched news term on Google in 2017, will grab headlines. Online fantasy sports gaming company FanDuel is running a league which offers winners various rewards in Bitcoin over the next few weeks. According to Business Wire, this is a first for the online sports gaming community. Fantasy sports have become massively popular around the world and FanDuel CFO Andy Giancamilli says the incentive to offer Bitcoin as a reward is a step towards the future, as cryptocurrencies move into mainstream acceptance. ���FanDuel has always sought to deliver the most unique and rewarding experiences or prizes to our users,��� said FanDuel CFO Andy Giancamilli. ���In awarding Bitcoin, we���re recognizing that most of our users are early adopters of technology and have a significant interest in cryptocurrency. Our fans love the prizing aspect of playing on our site and we think this will be a reward that they truly appreciate.��� Fantasy league players can enter a free-to-play contest which rewards one Bitcoin to the winner of the ���Bitcoin Bowl Free Play.��� The ���Bitcoin Bowl Tournament,��� a multi-entry competition costing $3 per entry, offers the winner two Bitcoin in reward. Finishing in second place offers 0.5 Bitcoin while third and fourth place will get 0.25 Bitcoin each. A player must select a full fantasy starting team comprising of one quarterback, one kicker, one tight end, one defense as well as three wide receivers and two running backs. The different players have different scoring opportunities that are recorded during a game, as per this guide from Rotogrinders. The wildcard round of the NFL playoffs got underway on Jan. 6. First up, the Tennessee Titans beat the Kansas City Chiefs 22-21 while the Atlanta Falcons beat the Los Angeles Rams 26-13. The Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Buffalo Bills 10-3 while the New Orleans Saints beat the Carolina Panthers 31-26 on Jan. 7.	2
Major crypto exchange Binance announced today, June 14, that it has updated its terms of use, which notably includes a restriction of services to United States-based individual and corporate traders. The restriction follows yesterday���s news that the company is launching a separate, fully regulated fiat-to-crypto platform for the U.S. market. Today���s announcement provides a timeline for the new terms to come into effect, specifying that: ���After 90 days, effective on 2019/09/12 [12th September 2019], users who are not in accordance with Binance���s Terms of Use will continue to have access to their wallets and funds, but will no longer be able to trade or deposit on Binance.com.��� While the use of a virtual private network could ostensibly allow U.S. users to circumvent the new restrictions, withdrawals for non-verified users remain capped at up to 2 bitcoin (BTC) per 24 hours��� worth $16,482 to press time. Sums above this threshold would require users to provide evidence that they are complying with the platform���s Terms of Use. In a tweet published yesterday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said of the new exchange���s evolving global structure: ���Some short term pains may be necessary for long term gains. And we always work hard to turn every short term pain into a long term gain.��� Earlier this month, it was reported that the decentralized exchange (DEX) developed by Binance will use geo-blocking to restrict website access to users in 29 countries, including the U.S. As Cointelegraph has previously reported, CZ revealed in September 2018 that the company intends to launch five to ten fiat-to-crypto exchanges ��� two per continent ��� within one year, without specifying the exact locations. The firm has to date launched fiat-crypto platforms in Uganda, Singapore and Jersey, with support for a limited range of cryptocurrencies. As reported yesterday, Binance is establishing its U.S. platform in partnership with BAM Trading Services, which is approved by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In June, Binance revealed that it would be issuing its own stablecoins pegged to different fiat currencies, but with the exception of the U.S. dollar. In the wider crypto sector, the Huobi Group ��� operator of the flagship Huobi Global crypto exchange ��� launched a U.S.-based strategic partner trading platform last year, initially dubbed HBUS, but later rebranded to Huobi.com.	0
The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Last year was a stellar one for Bitcoin, as it opened trading at $966 before embarking on a rally that took it to as high as $20,000. Even after the volatility of the past few days, Bitcoin has beaten all the other asset classes by a huge margin. The big question on everyone���s mind now is: what will happen in 2018 and how should one trade Bitcoin? The experts are divided in their opinion. The aggressive bulls have given targets of above $60,000 for 2018. That���s a 300% increase from the current levels. On the other hand, the skeptics continue to question the cryptocurrencies��� valuation, calling it a bubble. Some expect wild swings in 2018. Saxo Bank���s outrageous prediction lists a possible high of $60,000, followed by a drop to $1,000. Similarly, cryptocurrency entrepreneur Julian Hosp believes that Bitcoin will fall to $5,000, but he tends to think that it will also touch $60,000. He is not sure which level will be reached first. While the predictions offer us different opinions, it is difficult to trade off them. So we have tried to identify a few unique patterns on the charts that repeated in 2017. These can be used as guidelines by the traders to develop a suitable strategy for 2018. In 2017, 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) acted as critical support. As seen in the chart, this level was breached only four times.  In all other instances, the price touched the moving average or dipped below it during intraday, but quickly recovered. So, a purchase close to the 50-day SMA offers a low-risk buying opportunity. Buy close to the 50-day SMA and keep a stop loss below it. Bitcoin offered low-risk entry opportunities to the long-term traders en route to its 20-fold rise in 2017. It has not traded below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) since October 2015, which is critical support. In 2017, whenever the cryptocurrency broke below the 50-day SMA, it came within a striking distance of the 200-day EMA. This proved to be an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors. Even in the next fall, a move close to the 200-day EMA should be seen as a buying opportunity.  The price will not necessarily fall as low as the 200-day EMA, even during a large correction. On Jan. 12, for instance, it bottomed about 6.5 percent above the 200-day EMA. Similarly, on March 25, it was about 2.5 percent above the 200-day EMA. On July 16 the bottom formed 10.7 percent above the 200-day EMA. Though not perfect, traders can start their purchase about 15 percent above the 200-day EMA, with staggered buy orders below that. How do we calculate how far above is the price from the 200-day EMA? Though there doesn���t exist any specific indicator for it, we can use the ���Price Oscillator��� (PPO) by altering its values smartly. The PPO offers the percentage difference between two exponential moving averages. Therefore, if we need to plot how far away the price is from the 200 EMA, we can feed the values of 1,200, which will give us the desired result. If the price breaks down of the long-term moving average, it is a warning signal that things have changed. It indicates that Bitcoin is either entering into a long-term downtrend or into a range-bound action, which will require a different trading strategy. In trading, profit is made by buying and selling at the opportune time. While we have identified a low-risk buying strategy, we have yet to ascertain the best time to sell. Let's take a look at that, next. There was no indicator that would have given a consistent sell signal at the top. But it was noted that a simple trendline did the job perfectly.  As seen above, though a break and close below the trendline did not get you out of the position right at the top, it certainly helped to lock in most of the gains. Another indicator that could help is ADX.  Even as far back as 2014, a reading above 60 on the ADX has been a good selling point for Bitcoin. It is easy to identify and fit indicators and trendlines once the chart has formed. Doing the same with live markets is not an easy task. All in all, it is almost impossible to forecast cryptocurrenciy price movements for the whole next year ahead, because the marker is still young to have developed repetitive patterns of price behavior. Try avoiding long-term prognosis. Happy trading.	1
Further rumors are surfacing that Amazon will announce a Bitcoin-related innovation Thursday, as a German newspaper fuels speculation. In an article Tuesday, Die Welt reported that fintech sources in Silicon Valley were echoing previous hints from investor James Altucher that the global giant could soon integrate Bitcoin as a payment option. Altucher made the comments in a report last month, citing Thursday���s conference call as a D-Day moment for Amazon and Bitcoin. Ahead of the call, which anyone can listen to, momentum that the rumors actually hold substance are mounting. ���Even if the Oct. 26 date is not set in stone, Bitcoin introduction should probably be expected soon,��� Die Welt writes. Upon questioning Amazon, a spokesman replied to the publication in a predictably generic fashion. ���(Amazon) opts to include new products or services only when these are useful for our customers - until that point, we do not engage in rough speculation.��� The company has faced years of lobbying and rumors of various descriptions regarding its Bitcoin relationship since competitor Overstock became a pioneering virtual currency adherent in 2013. While multiple other midsize operators have since engaged with Bitcoin, Amazon���s participation would still be a first-of-its-kind move. Several dedicated services already exist to offer purchases with Bitcoin from their websites through the intermediary of gift cards.	1
On May 13, Elon Musk sent shockwaves across the crypto markets by revealing that Tesla will no longer accept any BTC payments for cars until Bitcoin mining becomes more environmentally sustainable.  Musk notes that while Tesla waits for Bitcoin to move to renewable energy, the firm will be looking at ���other cryptocurrencies��� that use less than 1% of Bitcoin���s energy per transaction. Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP The tweet sent much of the crypto community into a frenzy of speculation as to what other crypto assets Tesla may be exploring. Social influencer ���The Cryptic Poet,��� told his 45,000 Twitter followers that he predicts Tesla will ���either use ETH or XRP,��� however user ���Massimo��� pointed out that if Tesla uses ETH in its current state ��� which uses Proof-of-Work just like Bitcoin does ��� it might as well be ���staying with BTC.���  My prediction: Tesla will select either use ETH or XRP. According to an analysis by TRG data centers, Bitcoin is estimated to average around 700 kilowatt-hours, or KWh, per transaction. While it uses around as much power each year as the Netherlands, it's annual carbon footprint is closer to Singapore's according to Digiconomist, presumably due to the use of cheap renewable power for a considerable proportion of mining. (Note: estimates of power consumption per transaction are controversial, so they are simply used here as a very rough comparative tool).  Ethereum consumes an estimated 62.56 KWh, per transaction. The Ethereum network is currently secured using the same energy-inefficient consensus method as Bitcoin ��� Proof-of-Work, or PoW. Digiconomist estimates the Ethereum���s network���s annual carbon footprint is comparable to that of the country Sudan.  However, these issues are set to be  resolved with the network���s forthcoming transition to ETH 2.0, which will introduce Proof-of-Stake, or PoS. According to Nimbus, PoS consensus is estimated to be 99% more energy-efficient than PoW.  Earlier this month Rocket Pool contributor Joe Clapis proved the point by running 10 Eth2 validators for 10 hours on his front lawn using a power bank and a hard drive connected to a Raspberry Pi. But all Proof-of-Stake chains are arguably 99% more efficient than Bitcoin, so Tesla could pretty much choose any of them, from Solana to Cardano, and everything in between. Ripple (XRP) could be Tesla���s choice in the immediate term (depending on the SEC lawsuit), as all XRP tokens were pre-mined and XRP���s transactions incur a tiny amount of energy of just 0.0079 KWh according to TRG data centers. Ripple regularly puts out blog posts and releases touting how energy efficient it is in comparison to Proof-of-Work blockchains. Stellar Lumens (XLM) also follows the model of XRP as all of its tokens were minted at genesis. The network also uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, or SCP, to rely on for authentication of transactions which reportedly requires less energy than the PoW and PoS stake models.  Algorand could be a contender. Not only does it run on Pure Proof-of-Stake but the team announced its blockchain had become fully carbon-neutral on April 22. Algorand has also partnered with Spanish fin tech firm, ClimateTrade who are building a CO2 marketplace that enables companies to track their emissions in pursuit of broad sustainable goals. The firms will work together to implement a sustainability oracle to make the network carbon-negative.  Elon Musk���s long-standing favorite Dogecoin could be the dark horse (dark dog?) in this race. The meme coin actually piggybacks much of its mining on the Litecoin network, which uses Proof-of-Work. But while Bitcoin mining employs the ultra-complex SHA-256 algorithm, Dogecoin and Litecoin are mined using Scrypt, which is energy efficient and quicker (though considerably less secure). Interestingly enough, while TRG Data centers puts LTC���s power usage at 18.522 KWh per transaction, Dogecoin is estimated to use just 0.12 KWh per transaction.  Musk may have been looking at such estimates when he put up a poll on Twitter this week, asking if Tesla should start accepting Dogecoin payments.  Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?	2
After a volatile beginning of the new year, the crypto markets are again falling across the board. Almost all of the top twenty coins on CoinMarketCap are in the red on Monday, Jan. 22, with the biggest loss around 13 percent over a 24 hour period. Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching $10,000 again, a threshold that it had briefly dipped below on Jan. 17. BTC is trading for around $10,709 by press time, with a 8.95 percent drop over a 24 hour period.  Ethereum (ETH) is also below $1000, trading at around $981 at press time, with a 8.47 percent drop over a 24 hour period. The market���s early year dip appears to be a repeat of previous January lows, and 2017 had already seen three large drops of 38, 40, and 29 percent. This makes Jan. 17���s over 30 percent slide of both BTC and ETH seem to fit into a previously recorded pattern. This current dip could be related to a Wall Street strategist predicting a 70 to 90 percent price drop for Bitcoin on CNBC. The only two coins up are EOS, trading at around $13.29 by press time and up 2.10 percent over 24 hours, and VeChain, trading at about $8.29 and up 6.57 percent over 24 hours by press time. Total market cap is down to around $514 bln by press time, about $100 bln less than when the year began.	0
The crypto markets experienced an explosion of growth today, April 12, with Bitcoin (BTC) jumping more than $1,000 to break $8,000 over just a 30 minute period, and the rest of the market solidly in the green.  While no specific events have been confirmed as the reason for the sharp price jumps across the board, Twitter users have speculated that the recent news that Bitcoin has been declared compliant with Shariah law ��� according to a report published online today, April 12 ��� may have contributed to the spike: Positive Fud   Additional 1.8 billion people will now be able to buy #bitcoin #bitcoin is declared halal and holy for Islamic Community. Expect a bounce as soon as Saudi Arabia, Qatar & Abudhabi Sovereign Funds enters Crypto Markets ?https://t.co/ZKcdBCkkZ7 BTC is currently trading at around $7,817, up around 14 percent over a 24 hour period.  Cointelegraph contributor Joseph Young tweeted about the abrupt price rise, commenting on the spike as an example of typical Bitcoin behavior: Welcome to bitcoin pic.twitter.com/v5nuNQb5e2 Crypto trader and Twitter persona WhalePanda referred to the jump as a ���bear trap���: Nice move by #Bitcoin. Got to love that bear trap. pic.twitter.com/9SrHfJuFvO Ethereum (ETH) also experienced a notable price spike, jumping to around $465 by press time ��� after a month of hovering around the $400 mark ��� and is up by more than 12 percent over a 24 hour period.  Total market cap also hit above $300 bln for the first time this month, dropping slightly down again to $297 bln by press time.  Of the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap, EOS is still up the most, more than 30 percent over a 24 hour period, and trading at around $8.90 by press time. EOS���s price spike could be attributed to EOSIS���s April 9 pre-release of the Dawn 3.0 Blockchain platform. Some of the other top ten altcoins have seen high percent growth as well, with 9 of the 10 (including BTC) showing more than 10 percent growth over a 24 hour period. Cardano is up around 22 percent over a 24 hour period, trading for around $0.18; IOTA is up 14 percent, trading for around $1.18; and NEO is up almost 13 percent, trading for around $60.	2
Graphics processing unit (GPU) producer Nvidia is facing a class action lawsuit over the losses reported by the company when lower crypto prices diminished demand for GPUs by miners. Schall law firm announced the lawsuit on Dec. 24. The complaint states that ���the Company made false and misleading statements to the market.��� Namely, according to the announcement, Nvidia ���touted its ability to monitor the cryptocurrency market and make rapid changes to its business as necessary.��� Schall states that the GPU producer also declared: ���Any drop off in demand for its GPUs amongst cryptocurrency miners would not negatively impact the Company���s business because of strong demand for GPUs from the gaming market.��� As Cointelegraph recently reported, after the cryptocurrency mining crash, Nvidia was the worst reported performer in S&P 500. After a massive sell-off of its shares, the stock price of the company fell by 54 percent. In mid-November, an analysis by Susquehanna ��� a United States -based global trading and technology firm ��� observed that mining Ethereum (ETH) using graphics processing units was no longer profitable. In the Susquehanna analysis, the profit per month for GPU Ethereum miners hit $0 by Nov. 1, down from nearly $150 in July 2017. Earlier this week, Japanese firm GMO Internet announced that they would be leaving the mining sector, citing extraordinary losses over the year. Nvidia has not responded to Cointelegraph���s request for comment at press time.	0
For the umpteenth time, Bitcoin was declared dead this week as the cryptocurrency market took a major dive in value. Bitcoin dipped below $10,000 as others followed suit with even bigger drops as the panic spread about a burst bubble. However, the negative charts across the board took a positive turn as most of the numbers turned green across the major coins. The crypto market has generally been in a downturn since Bitcoin hit the $20,000 mark, but this recent collapse ignited genuine fear and panic. As the adage goes, a rising tide floats all boats, and conversely, the same happens when the tide drains. In other words, when Bitcoin is up, many coins follow, but as it has been in the last week, the entire cryptomarket took a hit as Bitcoin led the way in loss of value. In fact, most of the top 10 cryptos, and the more established and well-known ones fell harder than Bitcoin, leaving nowhere for digital currency investors to flee - other than out. There was a large outflow of money from the cryptocurrency market in these recent days, with the global cryptocurrency market cap dropping from over $700 bln to $400 bln. It was rounded out that Bitcoin���s fall - from about $14,000 to just under $10,000 equated to a 30 percent swing, which, looking back in history is relatively normal and expected. Bitcoin faced three similar, if not bigger drops in 2017:  While not out of the woods yet, the crypto market definitely looked a lot more optimistic as the floor seemed to be reached and green numbers were showing a turn in fortunes. The reasoning behind the most recent crash can, to a large part, be put down to the confusion that has been coming from Korea on alleged plans to ban cryptocurrencies in the booming Asian market. The country���s citizens spoke out recently about these rumors, making their position known with a petition containing 200,000 signatures, demanding the government respond.	0
More than 200 smart contracts have been listed on the Cardano blockchain explorer following the Alonzo upgrade on Monday ��� but there���s a catch.  As of now, the 200 smart contracts listed are in timelock and cannot be used by developers until they���re released. The Vercel App currently puts the number of smart contracts readying to be launched at more than 2,200. Smart contracts have been a long-anticipated feature on Cardano since its launch in 2017, and the functionality was finally enabled with the recent Alonzo hard fork. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and IOHK, said on Friday that the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is ���up for grabs��� now that Cardano supports smart contracts. Hoskinson said that the winners of what he called the ���second wave��� of DeFi were going to have liquidity and interoperability, the ability to move multi-chain and cost predictability. ���We need governance, we need certification, we need insurance, we need regulation on these things, metadata identity��� at the same time, you need to decentralize,��� he said, adding: There are several notable projects that have smart contracts in timelock or are planning on launching soon, such as GREED, a rewards token redistributing Cardano���s ADA back to holders; Liqwid, an open-source and non-custodial liquidity protocol for interest rate curves; SingularityNET, a platform that lets anyone create, share and monetize artificial intelligence services at scale; and Cardax, the first decentralized exchange on Cardano. Cardano will be Ethereum Virtual Machine-backwards-compatible and is hoping to attract DeFi developers who wish to save money on transaction fees. ADA���s price saw a huge 170% price run-up since mid-July, but it���s currently about 20% down from its all-time high of $3.09 at the start of the month. ADA is currently trading around $2.42.	2
Tuesday morning, Jan. 16, a South Korean petition against the regulation of virtual currency reached the amount of signatures required to compel a response from the government. The online petition calling the government to reconsider its stance on cryptocurrency regulation was started on the website of the South Korean presidential office on Dec. 28. On January 16, the petition obtained more than 212,700 signatures. According to the website of the presidential office, the minimum required for a government response is 200,000, thus officials are expected to react to the requests listed in the petition in the next 30 days. The petition asks the government to renounce proposed trading regulations that would ruin ���a happy dream��� that has been enabled by digital currencies. However, the petition still supports some of South Korea���s cryptocurrency regulations, such as banning anonymous trading accounts. Notably, South Korea���s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb also supports ���the right set of regulations���. Worried about a ���cryptocurrency obsession��� in the country, the South Korean government started considering a range of regulatory measures for crypto. Some of the proposed regulations include banning anonymous virtual trading accounts, forbidding underaged investors and foreigners from investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the Korean market, and even banning cryptocurrency trading outright. Cryptocurrency investing has become especially popular among South Korean youth since the country���s economic situation is notably hard for the young population. According to Quartz, the youth unemployment hit an all-time high rate of 12.5% in February 2017, compared to the average overall unemployment rate of 4.2%. Overall, the stance of the South Korean government towards cryptocurrency regulation has been contradictory during the last month, made particularly confusing by the Justice Minister���s informal proposal of a cryptocurrency trading ban, which was then widely misreported by mainstream media.	0
China will lead an international research group on the standardization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology, local news outlet Science and Technology Daily reports July 18. The joint technical committee of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have adopted the proposal for the creation of this international research group after a month of a discussion by committee members. Science and Technology Daily, the official newspaper of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, writes that the creation of this group means China has won ���discourse power��� in technology integration: ���It is of great significance for China's related industries to lead global development and promote the integration of fiat and [the] digital economy.��� The international research group, chaired by Dr. Shen Jie, will promote fiat-digital integration by providing a large number of industrial application scenarios as well as establishing a working mechanism to promote international standardization for IoT and blockchain technologies. The new research group will include experts from more than ten countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. China has recently taken steps forward in its adoption of blockchain technology.  Last month, the Digital Currency Research Lab at the People���s Bank of China (PBoC) filed a patent for a digital currency wallet that would allow users to track their transaction histories. Also in June, the PBoC had revealed a blockchain-powered system to digitize paper checks. Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that the deputy director of China���s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) had encouraged the country to ���unite��� forces to foster blockchain as a ���core��� technology for the new digital economy.	2
All of the top 50 cryptocurrencies fell by as much as 18.05 percent in the 24 hours to press time, Thursday, Feb.1, as fresh volatility in Bitcoin undermines previous sideways growth. Cross-exchange data from CoinMarketCap shows the broad copycat effect of Bitcoin���s drop on altcoin markets. Only six altcoins in the top 50 had made 24-hour gains at press time, with these nonetheless trending downwards. Bitcoin faces renewed pressure after India���s finance minister Arun Jaitley announced a crackdown on ���illegitimate activities��� involving cryptocurrency in his 2018 budget speech this morning. Jaitley also stated that the government does not recognize crypto as legal tender and would seek to freeze out crypto from the ���payments network���.  However, industry participants claim his words do not mark any real change in India���s regulatory perspective. Others, such as BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, decried negative press attention on India as ���FUD���, short for fear, uncertainty and doubt. Fud https://t.co/WjzwYj4KF5 Nonetheless, alternative viewpoints were enough to send Bitcoin below $10,000 again Thursday, with new lows centring just below $9600 on averaged readings. Bitcoin is trading at an average of $9,609 at press time, down almost 7 percent today. Running parallel to the news from India is an ongoing narrative surrounding the impact of Tether���s token supply on Bitcoin prices. After a curious second market reaction to news that Tether and associate exchange Bitfinex had received subpoenas from regulators in December, analysts are casting doubt on previous assumptions that Tether���s issuance was artificially raising BTC/USD rates. ���Given $USDT stores $2.2B in value ��� currently 0.4% of aggregate crypto value & 1.3% of total bitcoin value ��� have a hard time believing it could be systematically propping up these markets,���  Placeholder VC partner Chris Burniske wrote earlier Thursday in a series of tweets on the subject. 1/ I agree things don't smell right w/ Tether's $USDT, and @nathanielpopper's article covers it well: https://t.co/MvEQNBtul5 That said...	0
Another case of ���cryptojacking��� was detected on YouTube and resolved by Google over the course of this week, Ars Technica reported Friday, Jan. 26. According to the report, anonymous hackers have managed to run ads on YouTube that consumed the visitors��� CPU power and electricity in order to mine cryptocurrencies for the attackers. The users started posting complaints on social media this week telling that their antivirus programs detected cryptocurrency mining code in the ads that have been displayed to them by Youtube. According to the report of the cyber security company Trend Micro, the attackers have managed to place mining malware on YouTube via the Google DoubleClick advertising platform. The ads disproportionately  targeted users from Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain. The vast majority - ninety percent - of ads were using JavaScript code provided by Coinhive, a controversial cryptocurrency mining platform that allows its subscribers to earn income by using other people���s computing power in an unauthorized manner. As has been discovered by Trend Micro on Friday, the YouTube ads have been responsible for a threefold increase in Web miner detections worldwide. In reaction to complaints from the users, Google - who owns YouTube - has announced that the situation has been resolved in a couple of hours. According to an email from the company, "the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms." However, there is still no precise information about the timeframe of the events as Google didn���t provide any additional data, while Trend Micro claims that the warnings about the abusive ads started emerging as early as Jan.18. Earlier this month, the software security firm Check Point issued a report about a sharp increase in the prevalence of crypto-mining malware, stating that 55% of businesses worldwide are affected by the attacks. The report declared Coinhive to be the number 1 ���Most Wanted Malware.���	0
A clumsy trader claims to have ���destroyed��� his life after inadvertently paying $9,500 in fees for a $120 transaction on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. On Nov. 5, Reddit user u/ProudBitcoiner posted that he had accidentally paid 23.5172 Ether (ETH) for a single trade after getting the ���Gas Limit��� and ���Gas Price��� input boxes confused in the MetaMask wallet. Uniswap is a non-custodial exchange for ERC-20 tokens, meaning that trades are executed directly from a user���s wallet ��� allowing them to manually set the gas prices they are willing to pay for a transaction. The user noted they had recently downloaded MetaMask version 8.1.2, and had not previously encountered problems with the population of the Gas Limit field before. Redditor u/Mcgillby suggested that MetaMask introduce safeguards forcing users to confirm a transaction when the inputted gas price significantly exceeds the estimated price calculated by the wallet: In June, Cointelegraph reported on two mysterious transactions that each spent $2.6 million in fees to transfer roughly $130 worth of Ether. Analysts offered various explanations for the transactions, including a potential bug in a money laundering bot, revenge against a former employee, or simple human error.	1
Pineapple Fund, a Bitcoin-only charity, has promised to match up to $4 mln in donations to a non-profit for MDMA-based PTSD research. The non-profit leading the research, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), is seeking $25 mln in donations for Phase 3 of their drug trials. MAPS hopes to use MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as an effective treatment for PTSD sufferers. The Pineapple Fund was created in early December 2017 by an anonymous donor who goes by the Reddit handle /u/PineappleFund. The donor presents themselves as an early Bitcoin adopter whose goal is to give $86 mln, or 5057 bitcoins, of earnings to charity. A Jan. 10 Reddit post by /u/PineappleFund calls for donations to MAPS and announces the $4 mln pledge. The post also explains the usefulness of the MAPS trials due to what the anonymous donor sees as a lack of effective FDA-approved treatments for those suffering from PTSD. /u/PineappleFund appeals to the cryptocurrency community to send Bitcoin or fiat payments as donations to MAPS: ���If you believe that psychedelic drugs can have incredible therapeutic potential, then I believe this is one of the highest impact projects today.��� The anonymous donor then concludes: ���I believe we, the cryptocurrency community, can fully fund Phase 3 trials. Prescription MDMA could be a gift to this world from the bitcoin community.��� FDA approval for these experimental therapies is expected by 2021, pending positive results of the Phase 3 trials. Pineapple Fund already gave 59.89 bitcoin, with a value of $1 mln at the time of donation, to MAPS on December 14, 2017. According to the Fund���s website, so far approximately $20 mln has been donated to 23 organizations, including the Internet Archive, a NGO financing universal health care, and a philanthropic blockchain technology company. Pineapple Fund is not the only Bitcoin-only charity: BitHope, a Bulgarian-based NGO, exclusively accepts cryptocurrency to fund crowdsourced campaigns on its site. Other Bitcoin-based charities include BitGive and CommonCollection.	2
A new study by Recorded Future has found that Bitcoin is losing its position as the number one currency on the Darknet markets. The Internet tech company analyzed 150 of the most active message boards, marketplaces, and illicit service providers and noticed that the Darknet communities sentiments toward Bitcoin have taken a turn. The Darknet is an Internet that uses non-standard communication protocols and ports to make it a bit more difficult for the digital identities of users to be revealed. The Darknet requires users to run a special software,  the most popular being TOR. to connect to the Internet. One of the main purposes of using the Darknet is to make the information provider and the person accessing the information difficult to trace. Because of this privacy feature, the Darknet has become famous for its Darknet markets like Silk Road that allowed users to effectively exchange anything,  legal or illegal over an Amazon-like marketplace. The anonymous Internet is said to attract criminals and those interested in black market activities as well. In mid-2016, Recorded Future noticed that the 150 entities they were analyzing were all expressing concerns regarding the functionality, usability and security of Bitcoin in the Darknet economy. Although it was a relatively mild increase compared to the increase in interest in Bitcoin in the latter half of 2017, the Bitcoin network was beginning to become overloaded with traffic which resulted in higher transaction fees for those using the Darknet markets. On Dec. 23, 2017 transaction fees were $52.18. Recorded Future found that the average transaction size on the Darknet is $50-$300. If an individual tried to transact on Dec. 23, 2017 ��� it could have been the case that the transaction fee was more costly than the amount being transacted. One member of a Darknet message board posted this on the forum he uses: ���What's happening at the moment is incomprehensible. Despite that I've used the recommended commission fees, my transactions have remained pending for the past three days, and my work has been paralyzed. Dear vendors, please implement alternative payment options; otherwise, I will miss out on this Christmas season.��� The backlogged queue on the Bitcoin network was making it difficult for some individuals in the underworld to conduct their business. This users transaction was logged so far back in the queue that it took several days for it to become verified. To combat double-spending attacks, most vendors on the Darknet adopted a rule requiring three confirmations before treating transactions as complete. Because a transaction cannot be complete until the payment has been confirmed, this user was effectively frozen out of conducting his ���business.��� Although he was worried he would ���miss out on this Christmas season,��� his Christmas miracle was about to occur. To combat, the exuberant transaction fees that were increasing daily, vendors began accepting alternative payment options. The study found that Litecoin was the second most popular currency with 30 percent of all vendors accepting LTC, and Dash the third most popular currency, with 20 percent of all vendors accepting DASH. Back in 2016, economist Tuur Demeester was in the process of researching the Darknet markets. Demeester turned to r/DarkNetMarkets to see if the community could provide him with the statistics he was looking for: what percentage of trades on the Darknet was conducted with BTC?  Was DarkCoin used and how often? How many Bitcoins were spent on the Darknet on a daily/monthly/yearly basis? But Demeester was not met with any useful answers from the community. Prior to Demeester's endeavor, The Digital Citizens Alliance released a table with statistics about the number of drug listings on the Darknet markets in August 2014, but this table provided no information regarded prices, trade volumes and preferred payment methods.  Image source: Digital Citizens Alliance Furthermore, Nicolas Cristin, an associate research professor in the School of Computer Science and in Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) together with Kyle Soska, a Ph.D. candidate in CMU���s school of electrical and computer engineering back in 2013, conducted a study from 2013-2015 to get a handle on the Darknet market economy. When the Silk Road was shut down in October 2013, Cristin and Soska noticed that the take-down spawned the development of anonymous online marketplaces, which continue to evolve to this day. Cristin and Soska used long-term measurement analysis on 16 different marketplaces for over two years (2013��� 2015) to calculate the growth of the online anonymous marketplace ecosystem. Their research documented the types of goods being sold, the effect ��� or lack ��� of adversarial events, such as law enforcement operations and large-scale frauds, on the overall size of the economy. The two also gained insights into how vendors are diversifying and replicating across marketplaces, and how vendor security practices (e.g., PGP adoption) are evolving. Recorded Futures study concluded by stating that the efforts that vendors are taking to diversify acceptable payment methods on the Darknet markets will continue. Although payment methods like Litecoin and Dash are becoming more popular, Recorded Future still expects Bitcoin to have a place in the Darknet economy- just a much smaller market share than it currently has. Recorded future also warns that with increased popularity in digital currencies will come an increase in malicious tools like ransomware that will try to take advantage of the mainstream trends in cryptocurrency.	0
Animoca Brands��� virtual property and gaming firm The Sandbox is opening up part of its metaverse to players for the first time via a multi-week play-to-earn (P2E) Alpha event. But only a handful of lucky players will get to enjoy the full experience. The Sandbox���s virtual gaming world enables users to monetize their time spent in the metaverse via a play-to-earn model. Players can purchase land and create nonfungible tokens (NFT) within the game and earn the Sandbox token (SAND) by completing various quests. They can also stake the token.  According to a Wednesday announcement from the firm, the event will start on Nov. 29 at 1 pm UTC and will run until Dec. 20. A select group of just 5,000 users will have the chance to earn up to 1,000 SAND (worth around $3,500 at current prices) and three exclusive NFTs via time spent across 18 experiences developed by The Sandbox teams.  Get ready for The Sandbox Alpha! Launching November 29th Anyone can experience the Alpha hub and three experiences 5,000 Alpha passes giving access to content, NFT, and 1,000 SAND!Get all details below https://t.co/63iAl5MMmS pic.twitter.com/OiXmbAWYN2 The three exclusive NFTs will only be available during the event. They will depict a medieval-style gate, a blue-and-black dragon and a longsword, all of which are usable in The Sandbox metaverse. The Alpha Pass is an NFT ticket that grants full access to the event to 5,000 individuals. One thousand are up for grabs in a raffle for Sandbox Landowners, and 2,250 more will be given out to Sandbox account holders via daily social contests over a three-week period. These golden tickets will also be on sale on OpenSea���s secondary market between Nov. 29 and Dec. 19.  Players without the pass will be able to access three experiences and the Alpha Hub, a multiplayer gaming mode that features a range of locations and quests, but they will not be eligible for P2E rewards. According to data from OpenSea, the floor price for Sandbox NFTs sits at around 1.019 Ether (ETH) worth $4,284 at the time of writing. Total trade volume stands at 39,700 ETH ($165.3 million) since late 2019. For new users who are champing at the bit to enter the virtual game, Animoca Brands co-founder and chairman Yat Siu told Cointelegraph that people should take the time to carefully experience The Sandbox before snapping up tokenized land: ���I mean, you���re not going to just fly over to New York and say, ���I���ll take that,������ he added. At the start of this month, The Sandbox closed a $93-million Series B funding round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The firm stated that the project has been in development for four years and will launch its metaverse in ���phased stages��� moving forward. The funding will reportedly go toward scaling The Sandbox via developing new games and live experiences and seeking out additional partnerships with popular brands and intellectual properties. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of SAND hit a new all-time high of $3.42 earlier on Tuesday. SAND has been on a meteoric surge in 2021, gaining 8,663.5% over the past 12 months.	2
At a Blockchain conference hosted in Taipei, Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined the long-term roadmap of Ethereum development. According to Buterin, most of the underlying issues of the Ethereum Blockchain network fall under the following categories: scalability, smart contract safety, consensus protocol and privacy. Several network updates including the most recent Byzantium hard fork provided solutions in the four major areas. But, as Buterin noted during an interview with South Korean mainstream media outlet Joong Ang, it may take at least two to five years to truly solve scalability within the Ethereum network. Buterin said: ���I would say two to five, with early prototypes in one year. The various scaling solutions, including sharding, plasma and various state channel systems such as Raiden and Perun, are already quite well thought out, and development has already started. Raiden is the earliest, and its developer preview release is out already.��� In regards to scalability, the Ethereum Foundation and the open-source development community of Ethereum made significant progress with the upcoming launch of the Casper testnet and the introduction of Plasma, a second-layer scaling solution developed by Buterin and Bitcoin���s Lightning Co-author Joseph Poon. Casper is a long-term scaling solution that employs a hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol onto the Ethereum network. Currently, similar to Bitcoin, the Ethereum network solely relies on the PoW consensus protocol to maintain the network and to verify transactions. As Christian Reitwiessner, the team lead for Ethereum���s Solidity and Ethereum C++ implementation, explained in a recent paper, solutions like PoS is necessary to eliminate the workload of users, nodes, and dependence on miners. Reitwiessner wrote: ���Scalability does not come from the fact that Blockchains are relieved from their load by creating a big number of smaller chains and moving the transactions there. Scalability is only achieved once a user does not have to verify every single transaction that is sent to the system.��� Structurally, Ethereum is different from Bitcoin because it operates as a platform for decentralized applications (dapps). Hence, Ethereum urgently needs a scalable network which can handle dapps with millions of users through PoS solutions like Plasma. To improve privacy measures of the Ethereum network, developers of Ethereum integrated Zcash���s implementation of zk-SNARKs, to potentially settle anonymous and private transactions. The image below demonstrates a zk-SNARKs transaction processed on the Ethereum testnet. The transaction does not show the amount of the payment, recipient, and the sender.  JP Vergne, a professor at Ivey Business School, noted in a study that developer activity is the most accurate predictor of the price of a cryptocurrency. Vergne said: "We found that the best predictor of a cryptocurrency's exchange rate is the amount of developer activity around it.��� Ethereum is the only public Blockchain network and cryptocurrency in the market which comes close to Bitcoin in terms of developer activity and hence, given the introduction of innovative solutions such as Casper, Plasma, sharding, and zk-SNARKs on Ethereum, Ether price will likely surge throughout 2018. Mike Novogratz, the billionaire hedge fund legend, stated that he sees the price of Ether growing by three-fold by the end of 2018.	1
On a day where confusing news continues to emanate from South Korea and China on new proposed bans and restrictions on Bitcoin, a member of the board of Germany���s Bundesbank has called for a united global regulatory front. Joachim Wuermeling of Bundesbank believes there is very little chance of containing this digital global phenomenon with differing national rules across the globe. With international co-operation in regulating Bitcoin comes a chance for regulators to take control, says Wuermeling. There has been increased regulatory pressure on Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market recently, which has been felt across the board. The confusion that began in Korea caused a major dip, and even the retraction of those statements helped the market grow. Within these regulatory moves, from individual national countries, there are often powerful moves seen across the entire global cryptocurrency market. However, they are never really big enough to bring it under full control. These are case-by-case regulations, and these instances are not strong enough on their own for the free running cryptomarket to be constrained by. ���Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited,��� Wuermeling said. The issue is that there are two very different views to regulating Bitcoin, and these views can differ from country to country. Japan is one of the strongest supporters of the digital currency market, giving Bitcoin currency status last year. However, just across the Sea of Japan, on the mainland, China has been the lead actor in the war against Bitcoin. First there was the ICO ban, then the ban on exchanges, and now there is more bad news for those who even deal in exchange-like services. It is hard to find an agreeable position on digital currencies for nations with so many torn between different ends of the scale. This is one of the reasons why regulation is so difficult. There is also the discussion of the need for regulation as it seemingly flies in the face of what Bitcoin is trying to accomplish with its decentralized nature. Cal Evans, an International Technology Lawyer from London, says: ���As the cryptocurrency ���grows up��� it has had to overcome some serious compliance and regulatory problems internationally. These regulatory issues are numerous in nature depending on which country you read this in. Yet one problem seems to slip under the radar time and time again. Money Laundering.��� Adding to the devious nature, an unregulated currency brings London���s Kingston University economics professor Steve Keen echoes similar sentiments. ���You can���t be deregulated in a system where there will be criminal attacks. The code itself is clearly not foolproof. People will find their way in, forks will be forced upon them, whether they want them or not. In that situation, regulation may be the only future.��� It is clear that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to exist in ways that many regulators disapprove of unless there is a united front on wresting the digital currency economy under global control. Even banning the stuff in countries in China has only proved to be a speed bump in the road, Bitcoiners, and the likes can always find a way.	0
The mainstream media debate over Bitcoin as a success or failure approached live comedy this week after a ���brawl��� broke out between guests on a CNBC panel. In an exchange which ended an edition of the network���s increasingly notorious Fast Money segment, regular contributor and RiskReversal.com editor Dan Nathan told Evercore ISI technician Rich Ross to ���go piss off��� after he criticized Bitcoin���s performance. Ross had previously maintained that Bitcoin was a poor investment choice in the past few months due to its near-50% fall this week. Traditional stock investments, on the other hand, had allegedly fared better, with Ross giving the example of Boeing���s 200% gains since 2016. As Zerohedge notes, reproducing the unedited version of the exchange, Ross had failed to note Bitcoin���s annual gains of over 1000% in 2017 alone. Nathan labeled him ���glib��� to deride it. ���You���ve been wrong, so don���t say that I���m glib,��� Ross retorted before Nathan weighed in with the fateful remark: ���You don't know what I've done, you don't know what my call is, so go piss off, seriously.��� The episode continues Fast Money���s somewhat bizarre approach to Bitcoin reporting. In December, the segment made headlines for suddenly switching allegiances to become extremely bullish on altcoin Bitcoin Cash. At the time, its dedicated Twitter account began publishing material which strongly criticized Bitcoin, telling respondents to ���deal with��� the rise of Bitcoin Cash instead. That style of content has since not made a return.	0
Wall Street strategist and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors Thomas Lee has developed a ���contrarian index��� that lets investors know how ���miserable��� Bitcoin (BTC) holders are based on current prices, CNBC reports. The index is called the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) and was designed as a trading tool for investors to take advantage of volatility in BTC exchanges. BMI is calculated on a scale of zero to 100, taking into account factors such as volatility and the number of winning trades out of the total. When the indicator is low, the buying opportunity is at its best, and vice versa. ���When the bitcoin misery index is at ���misery��� (below 27), bitcoin sees the best 12-month performance. A signal is generated about every year,��� Lee explained to CNBC in a Friday report. "When the BMI is at a 'misery' level, future returns are very good." At the moment, the Bitcoin index is at 18.8, which is an absolute minimum since Sept. 6, 2011, the report said.  Lee���s comments follow a significant cryptocurrency market fall in which BTC lost almost 27 percent just after hitting a weekly high of $11,675 on Monday, March 5. A series of negative news resulted in heightened concerns about more regulations on crypto markets. On March 7, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a statement saying that all platforms trading securities are required to register with the agency as an exchange. Additionally, Japanese authorities temporarily halted the activities of two cryptocurrency exchanges and issued ���punishment notices��� to seven more, as reported on March 8. Despite Bitcoin currently trading at more than 50 percent of its December 2017 high of over $20,000, Lee has not abandoned his optimistic forecast of $25,000 by the end of 2018. Tom Lee is known for his bullish outlooks for BTC and as the ���only major Wall Street strategist to issue regular reports and formal price targets on bitcoin���, according to CNBC.	1
Bitcoin's future is undoubtedly tough to predict. The pundits either believe it will go to the moon or collapse. The latest to join the league of those predicting the demise of Bitcoin is Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University. Ken Rogoff is a professor of public policy and economics at Harvard University. He has a distinguished academic background, with degrees from Yale University and MIT. He served as the chief economist of the IMF from 2001 to 2003 and is a chess grandmaster. With such a background, it is inevitable that his views on Bitcoin attract a lot of attention. In a blog post in the Guardian, Ken Rogoff writes: "Is the cryptocurrency Bitcoin the biggest bubble in the world today, or a great investment bet on the cutting edge of new-age financial technology? My best guess is that in the long run, the technology will thrive, but that the price of Bitcoin will collapse." While he acknowledges that certain governments like Japan have taken the lead in regulating and accepting virtual currencies, he attributes it to a desire to become the global leader of fintech. He expects most governments to ignore Bitcoin when used for small, anonymous transactions; but act against it once Bitcoin becomes more widely used. "The long history of currency tells us that what the private sector innovates, the state eventually regulates and appropriates. I have no idea where Bitcoin���s price will go over the next couple years, but there is no reason to expect virtual currency to avoid a similar fate." Ken Rogoff's arguments for Bitcoin's eventual collapse seem to echo Jamie Dimon's views - that governments will not allow Bitcoin to become successful and will coerce Bitcoin users into abandoning it. When asked about the government's ability to shut down a currency which is virtual and knows no boundaries, Jamie had even added that governments could threaten Bitcoin users with jail. It is interesting to note that all the prophesies about Bitcoin's demise come from people within the establishment, whose very future Bitcoin threatens. The professor has predicted that Bitcoin will eventually collapse, but has given no time frame for this to occur. Hence it is impossible for him to be proven wrong, even if each Bitcoin becomes worth a million dollars, as it might still eventually collapse. Analysts who work in the real world (as opposed to theoreticians) have to make time-bound predictions. There is a lot of difference between an asset's price doubling in two years and doubling in twenty years. Comparisons with predictions made by another professor, Mark Williams, will be inevitable. Mark William was dubbed "Professor Bitcorn" after he bravely predicted in December 2013 that Bitcoins would be worth less than $10 by mid-2014. When Bitcoin remained at over $600 in June 2014, he remained defiant and stated that time would vindicate his prediction. By refusing to specify a time frame for his projection, Ken Rogoff has at least avoided Mark Williams' fate.	0
The amount of Ether held on exchanges has plunged over the past two days, with CryptoQuant data indicating that just 8.1 million ETH is currently sitting in the reserves of centralized exchanges. The acceleration of ETH being taken off exchanges was highlighted by Nuggets News��� Alex Saunders, who noted a 10% drop in Ether reserves on centralized platforms on Jan.14 ��� from 11 million to 10 million over 24 hours. ���Exchanges will run out of ETH in 10 days at current rate,��� he predicted.  Earlier today, Saunders noted the decline in Ether reserves had escalated by a further 20% leading him to suggest that centralized platforms may run out of ETH in the next 48 hours. Exchanges could be out of $ETH within 48 hours. Demand has sky rocketed. Exchange reserves fell 20% from 10M to 8M in the last few hours. With targets of $5k, $10k & $20k long term, I doubt many HODLers will sell their ETH in the $1-2k range. ��� #ETH2 #DeFi #NFTs #Gaming #DAO pic.twitter.com/rYPOch2u7p Other data providers also show that exchange balances have fallen by 42.5% since tagging an all-time high of 14.1 million in mid-May 2020.  Data from Glassnode indicates that Ether reserves on centralized exchanges have not been this low since July 2018. As of this writing, only 7% of Ether���s circulating supply is held on exchanges. Saunders interprets the data as suggesting an explosive bull-run into new all-time highs is imminent for Ether, stating:  CryptoQuant data shows that exchanges��� BTC reserves have fallen by 21% since posting an all-time high of nearly three million during March 2020. However, the recent acceleration in Ether being taken off exchanges far outpaces that of BTC. Exchanges' BTC reserves only fell by 4.5% since Oct. 21 while Bitcoin���s price increased 230%, from roughly $12,000 to $40,000. However, 600,000 of the recently moved Ether has been attributed to an internal transfer between Bitfinex cold wallets ��� one of which is believed not to be recognized by Cryptoquant. A further 2 million Ether that has left exchanges was identified as being moved to decentralized finance platform Gnosis.  According to crypto market data aggregator Into The Block, Ether is currently exhibiting numerous bullish signals, including a bid-to-ask volume imbalance of almost 9%.	2
Chinese citizens are still investing in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market despite the government���s heavy crackdown. In September 2017, Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin were ordered by the government to shut down their businesses. At one point, executives of the three cryptocurrency exchanges were prevented from leaving the country, due to a government investigation into local cryptocurrency exchanges. Three months later, in December of 2017, China���s three largest cryptocurrency exchanges relocated their businesses to Hong Kong. BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin rebranded to BTCC, Huobi Pro and OKEx, respectively. They intended to address the rapidly growing demand from Hong Kong-based investors. Shortly after their move, the three trading platforms started to see daily volumes from Chinese investors grow exponentially. Somehow, Chinese investors were managing to circumvent Chinese trading restrictions by using Hong Kong-based exchanges. How is this possible? In Hong Kong, it is relatively easy for investors to set up businesses. With less than $1,000, businesses can be legally created, which allows the opening of business bank accounts at Hong Kong-based financial institutions. Beginning in December 2017, many Chinese investors moved their funds from their Chinese bank accounts to Hong Kong bank accounts and started to trade cryptocurrencies more actively, effectively bypassing China���s restrictions. But, unlike China, Hong Kong has a substantially lower supply to meet the growing demand. While China is home to major miners like Bitmain, Hong Kong does not produce much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As such, premiums in the Hong Kong cryptocurrency market increased, surpassing even that of the South Korean market. On January 18, when the global average price of Bitcoin was around $11,500, Bitcoin was being traded at above $13,000 on Huobi Pro. Krystal Hu, a Hong Kong-based finance journalist, noted that traders outside of China have also started to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity presented by the Hong Kong market. For instance, on January 18, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase was $11,800. Purchasing Bitcoin from Coinbase and selling it on any Hong Kong-based market would have generated $1,200 in profit. Hong Kong���s exchanges have also integrated widely-used fintech applications in China such as Alipay and Tencent���s WeChat Pay. Alipay is a $60 billion fintech app that is used by more than 50 percent of mobile users. WeChat Pay, which was only used by seven percent of mobile users in 2014, is now being used by more than 40 percent of mobile users in China. The integration of the two fintech payment networks has increased the accessibility of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency OTC exchanges for Chinese investors, easing the process of investing in the cryptocurrency market. To prevent Chinese investors from buying digital currencies, the Chinese government and the People���s Bank of China (PBoC), have asked local banks to disclose any suspicious transactions linked to Hong Kong-based markets. However, even this action will not be able to prevent Chinese investors from accessing Hong Kong-based markets, due to apps such as Alipay and WeChat Pay.	2
Highly popular cryptocurrency price tracker CoinMarketCap removed several South Korean exchanges from its listings on Jan. 8, causing a dip in the overall market that particularly affected altcoin Ripple (XRP). The exchanges removed include Bithumb, the world���s second largest exchange in terms of trading volume, along with Coinone and Korbit. CoinMarketCap, which uses data from multiple major global exchanges to produce averaged prices for cryptocurrencies, tweeted Monday about their decision to remove the exchanges, saying that it was due to ���the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity.��� This morning we excluded some Korean exchanges in price calculations due to the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity. We are working on better tools to provide users with the averages that are most relevant to them. CoinMarketCap���s decision was followed by a dramatic reverse in Ripple���s record-breaking uptrend. The day CoinMarketCap removed the South Korean exchanges, Ripple saw an immediate loss of over $20 bln in market capitalization, and an almost 30 percent price drop Jan. 8. The altcoin was overtaken by Ethereum (ETH) as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ripple in particular is traded on South Korean exchanges at very high volumes, a fact which reportedly helped bring Ripple to second place on the crypto market just last week. Prices on South Korean exchanges are also over a dollar higher than on most other exchanges globally, which is part of what prompted CoinMarketCap to exclude them.  Rumors that Coinbase would add the altcoin, followed by confirmation on Jan. 4 that it would not, caused a peak and drop in Ripple���s price in the first few days of January. However the price drop after CoinMarketCap���s Jan. 8 decision had a more immediate and drastic effect, with an over 16 percent drop in the space of 6 minutes.  As a result of the move, XRP is currently trailing by some $0.60 on CoinMarketCap versus similar services such as Live Coin Watch, which still includes the major Korean exchanges. Users on Twitter complained that CoinMarketCap���s failure to promptly alert users about their decision caused panic selling that in turn aggravated the market drop. Coinmarketcap's decision to exclude Korean prices from the displayed XRP price made the price appear to drop, likely triggering some panic selling. Look closely at the data and don't be mislead. On Jan. 7 local media in South Korea reported that authorities will inspect six of the country���s major banks to probe for money laundering via cryptocurrency.	0
After four days of straight losses from Monday to Thursday, Bitcoin seems to have leveled off somewhat. However, 2018 has not started well as this marks the second week in a row of poor performances. While Bitcoiners have become accustomed to spikes and rallies, this flattening out of the price graph should still be seen as a positive. It comes over news of the South Korean justice minister���s backtracking of a proposal to ban local cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Regulators have long been behind the eightball when has come to controlling digital currencies as they work on a case-by-case basis. Time has now moved along swiftly as governments and officials have had their chance to put plans together which have affected the market. The past four days have seen Bitcoin down as much as 23 percent at a point in his second week of 2018, but far from being a dip, it has been a steady decline - far more nerve-wracking. Cryptocurrencies across the board have had some tough times in general, as Bitcoin price is inexplicably linked to most of the top altcoins. Talks of a bear market brewing due to patterns derived in the graphs have many searching for answers as to why the cryptocurrency has taken such a plunge since the highs of mid-December last year. One factor that has historically laid big blows on Bitcoin has been regulatory stirrings. The announcement by China that it would be banning ICOs and then following that exchanges, sent the market spiraling. This week, there were similar fears realized - albeit falsely - when the South Korean Ministry of Justice announced independently that they would be banning trading in cryptocurrency. This was done without the consent of the Ministry of Strategy and Justice and other government agencies involved in the South Korean cryptocurrency regulation task force. The market however reacted to the news which has since been clarified by the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of the South Korean President. According to a spokesperson from the South Korean cryptocurrency task force, there are no plans to ban cryptocurrencies. ���The South Korean government has no other choice but to follow the regulatory frameworks and trends established by other leading governments. While there certainly exists a negative reputation attached to the cryptocurrencies, the government���s stance is to allow what has to be allowed, for the benefit of the South Korean market.��� After banning ICOs, and then exchanges, Chinese regulators are now looking to go after miners in the Socialist Republic, a country that holds the majority of Bitcoin mining power. The reason for China being a powerhouse of mining has to do with the cheap and often subsidized power, which miners tap into. The plans are now to make this essential power more expensive, cutting into the profit margins. In the US, the SEC, which has had a bit of a history in the cryptocurrency space already, is starting to make a lot more noise in its attempt to regulate. Fears of money laundering and the use of cryptocurrencies for other fraudulent uses, has seen Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo take up the mantle of federal overseer of digital currencies. Regulators, even in China, have never been able to kill off Bitcoin. However, it is clear that they have a lot of clout when it comes to affecting the market price. This latest bout of regulatory muscle-flexing shows that there is a need for some parity between the regulators and the digital currency economy before things can continue on their merry way.	1
A new token, Squid Game (SQUID) ��� inspired by the eponymous Netflix show ��� has posted 45,000% growth in a few days after launching earlier this week, but multiple investors are reportedly unable to sell the token. ���We have received multiple reports that the users are not able to sell this token in PancakeSwap. Please exercise caution while trading,��� major crypto tracking website CoinMarketCap noted in a warning about the SQUID token on its website. According to CMC, PancakeSwap is the only market available for trading SQUID at the time of writing. The token is trading at ������$5.71 and is among the top gainers on CMC, with a daily trading volume of $7 million. Amid SQUID���s mind-blowing growth coupled with reports on the inability to sell the token, some enthusiasts in the crypto community have alleged that the new coin is likely to be a scam scheme. Twitter user Crypto Tyrion observed that the Squid Game token founders, who are mentioned on its website, are not on major professional network LinkedIn. They also stressed that the Squid Game token was blocking Twitter comments. ���100% rug pull,��� Crypto Tyrion said. Closed Telegram group: ������������Closed discord: ������������Blocked Tweets comments: ������������No founder Linkedin: ������������CNBC article to pump: ������������CONFIRMED SCAM@IncomeSharks @jaynemesis Some observers also pointed out apparent issues in the Squid Game token���s white paper, including poor grammar, spelling errors and claims that are ���impossible to verify.��� According to popular scam-check source Scamadviser, the Squid Game token���s website is suspicious, with a trust score of 45 out of 100. The idea of the Squid Game token is inspired by Netflix���s eponymous show where players risk their lives to play deadly games in hope of a big payout. The token is said to allow players to participate in six online games, with the goal of winning prize money. On Friday, CMC issued a post noting that SQUID���s rally may mean that playing the Squid Game described in the project���s white paper may be unaffordable for most participants due to SQUID holdings requirements. As such, the sixth, final game would require players to hold 15,000 SQUID, which is over $80,000 at the time of writing. CMC���s major rival, CoinGecko, has preferred to stay away from SQUID. ���This token did not meet our listing criteria hence it will not be listed on CoinGecko. It���s most likely a scam,��� CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong told Cointelegraph. He also stressed that CoinGecko is not the Squid Game token���s partner, as mentioned on its website: ���This is most certainly not true and we are not a partner nor are we affiliated with Squid Game.��� In its white paper, the Squid Game token is said to implement an ���anti-dump mechanism��� that prevents investors from selling their coins in a similar manner to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Specifically, users must hold so-called ���Marbles��� tokens in order to sell a certain amount of SQUID, the white paper notes: The white paper doesn���t provide much information about Marbles other than that ���Obtaining Marbles without using violence is the key to Squid Game.��� ���Liquidity of SQUID will be locked for three years on DxSale which prevents any unseen and immediate changes to SQUID liquidity pool. Unlock date is Oct 20th, 2024,��� the white paper also reads. Cointelegraph reached out through contact information listed on the Squid Game website with additional queries but didn���t hear back immediately.	0
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)���s first Bitcoin futures contract closed Wednesday, Jan. 17, at $10,900 after a relatively turbulent week in the crypto market had briefly brought Bitcoin���s (BTC) price below $10,000. By Jan. 9, there were 1,907 short position contracts for Bitcoin futures on CBOE. When the futures closed on Jan. 16, BTC had gone down about 36 percent. Reuters reported on the futures contract closing as a ���win for bitcoin bears over the bulls.��� CBOE chief executive Ed Tilly told the Financial Times: ���[The] market experienced a smooth operational close and the settlement process worked as designed.��� CBOE launched the BTC futures trading on Dec. 11, attracting so much trading volume to their site that it temporarily went down. The day of the launch, BTC prices remained between around $16,500 and $17,500. Looking back to before their launch, a Nov. 2017 CBOE blog post by CFA Russell Rhoads speculating on the unknown potential of Bitcoin futures reads: ���The question I am constantly hearing is, ���How will the futures prices relate to spot bitcoin pricing���, and the best (and most honest) answer I can give is, ���I don���t know��� [...] I���ve heard arguments for the futures trading at both a premium and a discount to the spot price, personally I think the best strategy is to see what the market tells us when bitcoin futures are available for trading.��� CME Group launched the world���s second Bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 18, with each contract representing five bitcoins, whereas CBOE���s contracts each represent one bitcoin. CME���s first Bitcoin contracts will expire January 26. Cointelegraph wrote in early January that the release of Bitcoin futures is an indication that more institutions, like those on Wall Street, are becoming willing to recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. #CT_questions  With #CBOE's first futures contracts having expired Wendesday, CME's are next in line. Their first contracts are to expire Jan 26. How will #Bitcoin's price react?	1
From the white paperback in 2008, Bitcoin was heralded as the revolution and cryptocurrencies, as well as Blockchain technology, the basis on which this financial freedom would be borne upon. Now, some 10 years later, and the market is full to bursting, along with a lot of people���s pockets, but has cryptocurrency changed the world? There is a lot of promise and potential in the cryptocurrency realm, but has even half of it been reached? Blockchain has loved the world over, but is it making an impact? Is Bitcoin the borderless, lightning fast and cheap currency it set out to be? What about adoption, are reatailers banging down the door to get paid in crypto? There has been huge gains made in this burgeoning market of cryptocurrency; however, there are also a lot of overjustified expectations that were not reached in a year full of hype. ���A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.��� The first line in Bitcoin���s Whitepaper, penned by Satoshi Nakamoto, is heavily weighted towards the founding digital currency to be exactly that - a digital currency. However, it is hard, for even the most ardent of Bitcoin fans, to call Bitcoin the ultimate and useful digital currency as it stands. The Cryptocurrency has gone through its changes this year, first with UASF coming after the Aug. 1 chain split, then with the recent failure to initiate SegWit2x. Of course, Bitcoin���s designation is determined by its users in a democratic way, but the way in which the original currency has headed has made it hard to be the pioneer of digital currencies that could revolutionize the world. That is not to say that things won't change. Lightning network is in the background, and there are always opportunities for changes, but 2017 saw Bitcoin drift away from its expectation to become a new era in money. When Bitcoin and others forced their way into the scope of the mainstream, those in the financial institution hissed and jeered at Bitcoin���s potential to usurp them, but they also found it hard to berate Blockchain technology. The scope and possibilities for Blockchain technology are nearly endless - and the amount of ICOs trying to use Blockchain to solve even the most benign of problems proves that. However, despite the likes of Microsoft incorporating Blockchain technology, and even banks in the use of Ripple, there has not been any real revolution with the use of Blockchain technology. The Blockchain has not yet found its ���Killer app,��� there are little shows of its power with things like Crypto Kitties on the Ethereum chain, but these are hardly forging a new world order on the Blockchain. The power of a trustless, unhackable, immutable ledger offers so much, yet that has not been grabbed yet. In this ecosystem of hype and grandeur there have been countless promises made along the way; too many to mention. But one thing that needs to be noted is that 2017 saw plenty of people baited onto enticing hooks through shilling or FUD along the way. Need we forget the parting shot from Bitcoin Classic which predicted that Bitcoin Cash would soon be ruling the roost. That could indeed still come to fruition, but in the now, it is important to note the spike in Bitcoin Cash���s price after that statement.	0
Bitcoin is beginning to seem like a viable currency, especially since reaching the $2,000 mark. Major setbacks, such as the loss of $480 mln due to Mt. Gox���s neglectful management of Bitcoins, have caused the cryptocurrency to plummet in the past. Slowly but surely, the first-ever Blockchain currency has climbed back. Presently, Bitcoin is performing better than it ever has. Early in 2017, Bitcoin price hit historic highs, surpassing the value of gold. Nearly a decade after Bitcoin���s quiet release, dozens of copycat currencies have arisen. Utilizing Blockchain, a public database or ledger that records transactions involving encrypted keys, developers are vying to improve the original digital currency. A few, namely Ripple and Ethereum, have proved to be exceptional competitors. Indeed, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance was formed by ���Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics, and technology vendors��� to establish standard practices for the use of the platform/currency hybrid ���at the speed of business.��� You may shy away from joining speculators on the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency markets. However, there are a few strong cases for investment. Here are three reasons to consider investing in cryptocurrency: 1. Bitcoin is experiencing massive growth By far the most popular digital currency is the progenitor of Blockchain technology. Bitcoin owns the lion���s share of the emerging market. Its trading volume is much larger than any other competing currency and its valuation is many times more than the second cryptocurrency of choice, Ethereum. Wider adoption and regular mainstream coverage have elevated Bitcoin from an intriguing security experiment to a possible real-world asset. Additionally, Bitcoin���s exponential growth may portend good things for Blockchain currency in general. After a few major cases of theft for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, trust in the currency seems to be rebounding. Some believe the cryptocurrency is a bubble about to burst, but contentious political and economic conditions could push the price up even further. 2. Ethereum is gaining traction Ethereum is the silver to Bitcoin���s gold. Although it currently sits at under $100 a unit, it���s the most viable alternative to the dominant cryptocurrency. In fact, the competing form of cash was crafted by one of Bitcoin���s co-founders. Ethereum is both a platform that allows for the creation of decentralized applications and a currency. The currency, Ether, fuels the platform. Its incorporation of smart contracts, which allow for anonymous agreements on the Blockchain, spawned the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). The currency is more flexible for developers and has attracted major tech players, such as Intel and Microsoft. 3. It may see friendly regulation The anonymity and lack of oversight concomitant with decentralized currency create opportunities for abuse. Certain alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), ones that enforce private transactions and anonymous transfers, such as Zcash and Monero, have been used extensively by criminal organizations. Although altcoins like Monero have increased in value due to acceptance from darknet users, this illicit usage of cryptocurrency has dealt damage to overall adoption rates. Thankfully, we may see tighter regulations. Ethereum famously experienced a massive theft of $53 mln in Ether due to an exploit in a smart contract. Theoretically, the Ethereum Blockchain is immutable. The community voted to override this ���immutability��� in order to return stolen funds. Further, in 2013, a representative for the Bitcoin Foundation told US regulators that they would be open to transparent rulemaking. According to MarketWatch, digital currency advocates are pushing for more regulation. With recent interests from Japan and Russia to legitimize Bitcoin, these rules and regulations could help further cryptocurrency as a legitimate finance asset. Blockchain technology has the capability to change everything. The currencies running on the distributed ledger model could revolutionize how we interact with all forms of liquidity. While it is unlikely that fiat currency will be subsumed or overtaken by the digital mint, it���s quite possible that these currencies will see greater integration with our current systems. At the very least, cryptocurrency is seeing a meteoric rise in the short-term. What the future holds for digital currency is uncertain. Currently, there is a cautious sort of endorsement for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some speculators are pouring their cash into speedier alternatives, such as Litecoin and Dash. Still, most remain hesitant about moving their assets into an unbacked, unregulated currency. Although the Bitcoin ETF was recently shot down by the SEC, there is still plenty of reason to diversify your portfolio with a small investment in decentralized digital currency. As time has worn on, cryptocurrency has steadily risen in price and has experienced wider adoption. To be sure, there has also been a great deal of volatility concomitant with Bitcoin���s rise. Valuation specialists continue to have trouble pinpointing the exact value of the currency itself and sentiment can vary wildly. Still, market capitalizations continue to grow. If you are able to steel yourself against booms and busts, you may profit from cautious investment. Continue to do your due diligence. If you remain uncertain, consider consulting a financial analyst. Remember to monitor updates, vigilantly investigating changes in sentiment. As always, be prepared to lose any amount you put into a speculative investment. Dedicating yourself to mindful investing will undoubtedly lead to the best result - especially in a market as volatile as the cryptocurrency market.	1
UPD: The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the federal government agency for scientific research in Australia, stated that Blockchain technology will have a profound impact on the Australian economy.  Bitcoin will be treated as money in Australia by July 1, 2017, and will be exempt from goods and services tax (GST). Bitcoin traders and investors will not be taxed for purchasing and selling Bitcoin through regulated exchanges and trading platforms.   Over the past two years, the Australian Bitcoin exchange market significantly fell behind growing markets such as South Korea, Japan and South Korea, that control more than half of the global Bitcoin exchange market share.   Two majors factors which drove startups, exchanges and businesses dealing with Bitcoin and other digital currencies in Australia away from the country where the termination of banking services by leading Australian banks due to their anti-competitive nature and the double taxation of Bitcoin trading by the Australian government.   Starting July 1 however, double taxation and trading and goods and services taxation on Bitcoin will be exempted. In its 2017 to 2018 budget for ���Backing innovation and FinTech,��� the Australian government wrote:   ���The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia. From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes. Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.���    More importantly, the Australian government���s new vision to spur the growth of fintech and the digital currency market would most likely prevent local banks and financial institutions for unfairly denying banking services to Bitcoin businesses and exchanges.   If the above mentioned issues can be resolved by July 1, the Australian Bitcoin market could potentially experience a rapid growth in terms of user base and trading volumes. The document further read:   ���Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia. That is why the Government���s $1.1 bln National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) is designed to enable Australia to take full advantage of new economic opportunities. The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (fintech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.���    At the Blockchain NZ conference held in Auckland, New Zealand earlier this week, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos emphasized the Australian government���s uninvolvement in its local Bitcoin market and the impact of such actions on Bitcoin businesses and exchanges.   More to that, Antonopoulos criticized the local government���s taxation policy on Bitcoin, which essentially drove away businesses and users from Australia to other countries.   ���Governments can choose to either do nothing ��� which is okay, make things worse for cryptocurrency trading ��� like what Australia did by imposing sales taxes on all cryptocurrency transactions, or they can make things easier for companies by reining in the banks and encouraging companies by creating a level playing field,��� Antonopoulos said.   With Australia���s new policy, the Bitcoin ecosystem in the country could change drastically. Banks will start offering services to Bitcoin exchanges and traders will not be taxed with GST upon the purchase of Bitcoin.	2
PayPal���s entry into the cryptocurrency market could be having a dramatic impact on the Bitcoin (BTC) price.  In a newly published report, crypto investment firm Pantera Capital says a Bitcoin shortage is at the heart of the recent price surge and that the majority of newly minted BTC is being scooped up by PayPal.  PayPal���s new crypto service is ���already having a huge impact,��� Pantera claims, adding that the payment merchant is snatching up roughly 70% of all the new BTC in circulation. Citing itBit data, Pantera claims: According to Pantera, the data suggest that PayPal and Cash App combined are buying up all of the newly-issued Bitcoin. Bitcoin���s monetary policy is programmed to be deflationary over time. With widescale adoption, that leads to higher purchasing power and supply scarcity. Pantera claims it is the latter that is contributing to BTC���s parabolic surge.  PayPal launched its crypto trading services in the U.S. earlier this month, allowing customers to trade up to $20,000 a week. The platform will be rolled out globally in early 2021.  The online payment merchant has 300 million active users, which makes its foray into digital currency a major stepping stone for adoption.  Pantera says it���s a lot easier to purchase Bitcoin now than it was during the last bull market in 2017. In addition to PayPal, retail onramps into Bitcoin and other digital currencies now include Cash App and Robinhood.  Wider adoption means the digital currency is more likely to sustain higher price levels. Although Bitcoin remains highly volatile, it carved out an unusually long period of stability before catapulting higher over the past two months.	2
A Bitcoin (BTC) whale ��� an individual investor who holds a large amount of BTC ��� took profit after two years. Data from Whalemap suggests the whale purchased nearly 9,000 BTC in the third quarter of 2018. A pseudonymous trader known as ���Byzantine General,��� who shared the data, said: ���This whale is a legend. See that big bubble around 6k in 2018? That's almost 9k BTC that was accumulated there. He finally took profit, after 2 years and 2 major capitulation events.��� The whale held on to the BTC for nearly 22 months, through two major capitulation phases. Bitcoin dropped to sub-$4,000 level twice, first in January 2019 and second in March 2020. The investor waited through both periods, ultimately selling at around $12,000.  Number of Bitcoin held by a whale. Source: Byzantine General, Whalemap On Aug. 16, Cointelegraph reported that large whale clusters are present in the $12,000 to $14,000 range. At the $12,000 level, many whales are either in profit or at breakeven, which arguably could give whales an incentive to sell. Whether it shows whales are cautious that Bitcoin has hit a local peak remains unclear. Whales, due to the sheer size of their holdings, follow liquidity. If they feel that there is sufficient liquidity to sell, possibly as a result of rising retail activity, then they are likely to sell. Hence, a whale���s sell-off does not necessarily show that Bitcoin has peaked. One could argue that it raises the chances of consolidation in the short term. But until BTC drops below key support levels, it is premature to suggest a local top has formed. Also, it is difficult to estimate how much of the 9,000 BTC the whale sold. A reason some whales appear to be taking profit at current levels might be Bitcoin���s relatively high spot volume. According to another pseudonymous trader known as Bitcoin Jack, the market remains ���awkwardly��� driven by the spot market. He said: ���Market remains awkwardly spot driven for now. Market remains relatively high on-chain dominance Price expansion is therefore imminent again���direction unclear but low derivatives vs spot and spot exchange vs onchain dominance indicates we have not seen an irrational top.��� When the market is heavily driven by the derivatives market, whales have less liquidity to seek, and minor pullbacks could cause large price movements. In the short term, traders remain mixed on the sentiment around Bitcoin. Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Cointelegraph Markets analyst, says BTC could drop to as low as $10,000 if it loses $11,450. He said: ���Pretty easy going here as there's a rejection at $11,600. If we hold the $11,450-11,500 area I think we'll have a breakout towards $12,000 in the coming week. Losing the green zone and I'm targeting $10,700 or even $10,000.��� Following a nearly three-fold increase in price, a consolidation phase in the near term could strengthen the momentum Bitcoin in the longer term.	1
Co-founder and Fundstat strategist Tom Lee predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $25,000 by the end of this year in an interview with CNBC today, Jan. 18. Lee had previously forecasted that BTC would only reach this mark by 2022. The Wall Street strategist told CNBC today that now by 2022 he sees BTC hitting the $125,000 mark. Lee���s prediction comes after a very volatile week in the crypto market, with BTC hitting below $10,000, dipping even lower than it did during the market crash Dec. 22. Just days before the December crash, Bitcoin had hit an all-time high over $20,000. Lee predicts that $9,000, or just below the lows seen this week, will be the price floor for BTC this year. He sees another market dip as an opportunity for investors: "We expect bitcoin's major low to be $9,000, and we would be aggressive buyers around that level [...] We view this $9,000 as the biggest buying opportunity in 2018." Lee also offered predictions for several altcoins, forecasting that Ethereum and Ethereum Classic would see about 90 percent growth by the end of the year, and NEO 50 percent. Today, the crypto market began its bounce back, with BTC up almost 15 percent and the top 20 altcoins up as much as 70 percent in the 24 hours to press time.	1
Ripple (XRP) has hit huge new all-time highs as the altcoin joins Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) in debuting on Bloomberg Terminals. News that Bloomberg had added the three cryptocurrency assets to its benchmark price tracker sent XRP soaring to almost $0.90 per coin - an increase of almost 300 percent in just three days. The publication���s journalist Lily Katz confirmed the additions Thursday. Come one, come all -- @TheTerminal has officially added ether, litecoin and ripple pricing pic.twitter.com/RDGchH5QEP This week has seen altcoins broadly return to form after several weeks of intense investor attention on Bitcoin, which also hit new all-time highs Friday of almost $17,900. ETH and LTC have surpassed short-term expectations in recent days, rising to above $750 and $300 respectively. In addition, Dash almost claimed the $1,000 price tag before correcting down towards $900, all assets following in the steps of Monero, which suddenly rallied to three times its price over the past two weeks. Markets are likely set to see further flux into and out of Bitcoin over the coming weeks as a host of hard forks make their debut, investors keen to access duplicate balances tradeable on exchanges. Super Bitcoin held its network snapshot this week, while Bitcoin Platinum, Bitcoin God and Bitcoin Cash Plus are also due to do so before the end of the year. Bitcoin Silver and Bitcoin Uranium are also planned, while Bitcoin Diamond futures are already being tracked on Coinmarketcap.	2
The price for MIOTA, the cryptocurrency for the IOTA platform, has exploded over the past week, gaining massive value and surpassing Ripple to take the #4 spot among cryptocurrency market caps. The price explosion has come on the news of a major agreement being signed with Microsoft, Fujitsu, and others for business-to-business data sharing. The price rally began around Dec. 2, with the price moving toward $1.50. However, the real explosion has come in the past 48 hours, as the price has steadily increased at exponential rates. At press time, MIOTA was trading at $4.64. IOTA is famous for its ���Tangle��� system - a platform of interconnected nodes that both validate and create transactions. The system is designed to allow users to create transactions simply by validating, meaning that all transactions are secure, immutable and, most notably, free. Because the system allows for zero transaction fees, it is ideal for the data industry, as micropayments for data among businesses cannot be suitably handled by legacy Blockchain technology systems. The interest in the technology will likely continue to grow as the need for scalable free transactions grows as well.	2
The cryptocurrency market is getting back on its feet after a brutal day yesterday. The majority of coins have risen by 10-20% over the last 24 hours after more than a 30% fall on Friday, Dec.22. The total digital currency market capitalization went from $650 bln to $430 bln yesterday and has now rebounded to $585 bln.  Bitcoin went from the all time high of over $20,000 to as low as $11, 970 in just a matter of days. By press time it has partially retraced its losses and is now traded at around $15,500.  Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, lost almost $30 bln in market cap yesterday, but has largely recovered. Its market capitalization is now $72 bln. It now trades for around $720 on European exchanges and as high as $906 on South Korean markets.  Bitcoin Cash experienced the greatest price volatility of all major digital currencies over the last 48 hours. The price fell from $3,909 to $1,970 but at press time is back to $3,400.  The extreme market turbulence came days after the alleged insider trading at Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. It���s been an extremely volatile week for the entire digital currency industry. Following CBOE���s Bitcoin futures trading start on Dec. 10, the CME group launched a futures product of its own. Trading at CME opened Dec.17, roughly when Bitcoin���s volatility began to increase. On Dec. 20 Litecoin creator Charlie Lee sold or donated all his Litecoins, ostensibly to avoid ���conflict of interest.��� However, some have questioned his motives, since just a week earlier he predicted a multi-year bear market which would see the price of Litecoin drop as low as $20. Ok, sorry to spoil the party, but I need to reign in the excitement a bit...   Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy! ?  Joining major institutions like CBOE and CME in their Bitcoin agenda, Goldman Sachs announced its plans to set up a cryptocurrency trading desk on December 21. It will be opened by the end of June 2018. What prompted the latest dip in the entire market is yet unknown. Charlie Shrem, a founding member of Bitcoin Foundation, believes that the market has already seen similar price movements and there is no reason to panic. ���There is nothing new under the sun��� - Same thing happens every year (https://t.co/qaNwMLJH3k) pic.twitter.com/sJQqGLb2wp	2
���All��� Chinese virtual currency exchanges must stop trading to remain compliant, regulators have announced. Information slowly appearing from China appears to confirm that trading will no longer be legal for Bitcoin-to-fiat platforms. Beijing market regulator requires all virtual currency exchanges (ie. OKcoin and Huobi) to stop trading by end of today.  Bitcoin prices are already reacting, with 24-hour losses approaching 21% at $3000. Cryptocurrency CEOs have reacted to BTCChina and now other exchanges shutting down with firm plans for the future. Speaking in emailed comments, several industry players said that while markets were reacting harshly to Chinese regulatory moves, the long-term benefits for Bitcoin���s ethos and therefore stability were clear. ���The price is always a solid metric of the markets��� greed and fear, and reflects regulatory uncertainty at the moment,��� Leverj CEO Bharath Rao commented. ���This also signals that development of non-custodial and decentralized models will accelerate.��� ���Regulation is neither necessary nor possible for decentralized models, and the future may have gotten just a bit brighter by nudging the crypto community to develop high speed, non-custodial exchanges.��� Chinese investors became notorious for their short-term trading activities, which often influenced Bitcoin volatility in the past. The latest regulatory warnings produced a second mass exodus to p2p trading platforms such as Localbitcoins this year. With sanctioned Bitcoin-to-fiat trading looking to stop in China altogether, an major market influence will disappear, but this may not be the case forever. ���China is practically building a cottage industry for mining and exchanging bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so it is hard to believe that they intend to exit a market with so much potential upside,��� Jason English of Blockchain alliance Sweetbridge continued. ���Even the apparent ban on ICOs seemed to be more of a stopgap in order to get some policies in place. If anything, this example shows the volatility of the space and that some market-makers can likely take advantage of an unclear news cycle to create a sell-off and buy back opportunity.���	0
Bitcoin's stupendous rally in 2017 has clearly enthused the supporters of Bitcoin. Standpoint Research���s Ronnie Moas, who is one of the most bullish analysts on Bitcoin, has revised his prediction upwards. Ronnie Moas had surprised observers by his bold prediction in July 2007 that Bitcoin could reach $5,000 within months. The price was less than $3,000 when he made the prediction, but it jumped up to over $5,000 in Sep. 2017 before retracing briefly. In August 2017, the rapid increase in Bitcoin price led to Ronnie Moas revising his projection to $7,500 by the end of 2017. Bitcoin's rapid increase in price has dwarfed that projection as well, with Bitcoin price crossing $7,400 today. Ronnie Moas has now revised his projection, raising it to $11,000 in 2018. In an email to his clients, Ronnie wrote: Every day more headlines are hitting the newswires on crypto. More countries are embracing it, and the few obstacles that were standing in the way are falling down like dominoes. Ronnie Moas is ultra-bullish about Bitcoin's potential in the long-term and believes that it will rival gold one day. He has predicted that its price will cross $20,000 in three years time and $50,000 in 10 years time. Given the current bull run of Bitcoin, he might even shorten the time frame projected for Bitcoin to reach those levels. While Apple might be the company with the highest market capitalization and whose value is reaching record levels each day, Ronnie believes that Bitcoin will overtake Apple in just five years. Ronnie believes that the price increase will be driven by increased awareness of Bitcoin and a larger proportion of the world's population investing in it. It is estimated that less than 0.5 percent of people currently have invested in Bitcoin and Ronnie believes that this could increase to five percent. Since the supply of Bitcoins is fixed, the demand-supply imbalance will cause the price to soar. Bitcoin's current rally has clearly divided people into two opposing camps, with the bulls becoming more bullish and the bears crying bubble.	2
After a veiled suggestion from president Asiff Hirji that Coinbase would potentially add other assets, the exchange has officially launched support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), according to the company���s blog post. The addition is a welcome Christmas gift for those who held Bitcoin (BTC) in Coinbase wallets on August 1 when the BCH fork occurred. Users who had BTC at the time of the fork have received an equal amount of BCH in the newly created wallets. After previously refusing to support the coin, the company promised that BCH support would come before the end of the year. The blog post also made clear that Coinbase employees have been restricted from trading BCH on the site for a number of weeks prior to the announcement. Nevertheless, accusations of insider trading have hit Twitter. hey @coinbase , @GDAX and @brian_armstrong by being part of a product index for @CMEGroup you agreed to certain rules. Since bch news was clearly leaked around 2:30pm CST to certain parties. this qualifies as insider trading. Hope you enjoy the incoming complaints. After the announcement, Bitcoin Cash���s price almost immediate jumped to over $3,000 on huge volume.  Interestingly, GDAX, the Coinbase affiliated site for trading, showed a startling price of $9,500 per BCH, though trading on the site was halted.  The Coinbase site showed the more widely published pricing. At press time, BCH was trading at $3,185, per the Coinbase site. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $17,000, having dropped from $19,000 to a low of $15,700 before partially recovering.	2
The co-founder of cryptocurrency analysis company Blockfyre believes that a bull run will return, propelling Bitcoin (BTC) to a price of $150,000. In a tweet on Thursday, Simon Dedic suggested that these gains will not be reflected across the entire cryptocurrency market, although the more solid altcoins should also see impressive price action. Bitcoin���s dizzying ascent to its current all-time high of almost $20,000 in December 2017 came complete with a media frenzy around all things crypto. Coupled with a boom in initial coin offerings and fuelled by investor FOMO ��� the fear of missing out ��� money was thrown at literally any project in the hope that it would mirror the gains of Bitcoin. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy and pretty much every altcoin posted a significant price increase during 2017.  While Dedic warned that he believes this won���t happen again, he does envision a Bitcoin bull run returning and ���pumping the few solid alts out there.��� He even went as far as to make a number of price predictions, such as Bitcoin gaining over 1,400% from its current price of around $9,750 to reach his target of $150,000. Ether (ETH) is set to fare even better according to Dedic, increasing more than 3,570% from current levels around $245 to a price of $9,000. And Binance Coin (BNB) is predicted to see a 2,750% rise to $500. Bigger increases still are forecast for Chainlink (LINK) and Tezos (XTZ), both with a target price of $200, representing 4,450% and 6,800% gains, respectively. But this all fades into insignificance compared with Dedic���s prediction for VeChain (VET), with a seemingly modest target price of $1. However, this marks a massive 14,100% increase on its current price of $0.007. VeChain has recently partnered with fresh meat suppliers in China to improve traceability and Walmart���s Chinese subsidiary to track food products.	2
Cryptocurrency mining is putting an undue amount of pressure on the electrical infrastructure of Douglas County, a small territory in Washington state, CNBC reports. Crypto miners are flocking to Washington to take advantage of the state���s cheaper electrical costs, creating a need for more data infrastructure to keep up with the higher energy demand. The price per kilowatt of electricity is around four cents in Washington state, as opposed to the average of seven cents in the rest of the US. Port of Douglas County Economic Development Manager Ron Cridlebaugh responded to the problem by stating plans to add 100 megawatts of data center infrastructure to the county. Cridlebaugh said in his CNBC interview: "Our infrastructure is actually being put to the test. We're full...It's going to take some time to catch up because growth has been so quick.��� A December 2017 study by the electrical supply company Crescent Electric (CESCO), named Louisiana as the cheapest US state for cryptocurrency mining -- a low 9.87 cents per watt makes the cost of mining one Bitcoin about $3,224. According to the same study, Washington is the third cheapest state for mining, with the cost of mining one Bitcoin averaging $3,309. The mining of Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies has sparked debate over its environmental impact, with critics complaining about the costs and possible effects of such a high-energy endeavor. Opponents maintain that crypto mining is actually the lesser of two evils, arguing that fiat money production consumes more energy in comparison.	1
According to a new investment thesis released by Grayscale Investments, the value of Zcash (ZEC) could reach over $62,000 by 2025, assuming that the coin will represent 10 percent of all offshore wealth by that point.  The report, written by financial analyst Matthew Beck, contains an all-caps disclaimer in a footnote below the chart that states the prices are ���PURELY HYPOTHETICAL���,  as well as that: ���NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY RESULTS WILL OR ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PRICES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN.��� Zcash is an anonymity-focused digital currency that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify the validity of a transaction without revealing its contents, giving it appeal as a ���Swiss bank account in [your] pocket.���, as Grayscale phrases it. Grayscale Investment specifically manages investments in digital assets, overseeing both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) funds, the latter added to their portfolio in April 2017. The company���s high assessment of ZEC���s potential for growth is due to its similarity to BTC and ETC in combination with its privacy and store-of-value properties. Grayscale���s investment thesis concludes that while it is hard to pick out which digital assets are ���truly revolutionary���, ���We have come to believe that ZEC marks the next generation in a class of investable digital assets, complementing BTC and ETC, and broadening a new dynamic asset class.��� In the spring of 2017, Zcash was added to a the crypto multi-currency wallet Jaxx and in the fall, Zcash was added to South Korean-based Bithumb, in spite of tightening regulations on crypto in the country. Edward Snowden, privacy advocate and NSA whistleblower, tweeted in September 2017 that Zcash was ���the most interesting Bitcoin alternative.���	2
Morgan Stanley is now clearing Bitcoin futures for their clients, meaning that Goldman Sachs is no longer the sole Wall Street firm doing so. Morgan Stanley joins Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, E*Trade and others in clearing CME and Cboe Bitcoin futures. The reaction of the Bitcoin community has been divided over the creation of regulated Bitcoin futures, with some suggesting manipulation of the underlying Bitcoin market. However, it���s clear that the more Wall Street firms that get involved in anything related to Bitcoin, the more legitimacy it gives to digital currency. Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said the brokerage was mostly concerned with servicing its institutional clients:: ���I wouldn���t say it���s been a lot of activity, but it���s for core institutional clients who want to participate in a derivatives transaction.��� Given indications that institutional investors may be starting to play a much greater role in the Bitcoin markets, this is significant. If such institutions become interested in acquiring Bitcoin, the price will certainly soar. Indeed, Coinbase is targeting just such clients with their Coinbase Custody product. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes institutional investors may be ready to invest as much as $10 bln.	2
Sparkpool, the second-largest Ethereum mining pool in the world, is suspending operations due to the ongoing Chinese crackdown on crypto. The mining pool officially announced that it has suspended access to new users in mainland China on Monday in response to Chinese authorities initiating new measures to combat crypto adoption in the country. Following the initial restrictions made last Friday, Sparkpool will continue shutting down services, and plans to suspend existing mining pool users both in China and abroad on Thursday. According to the announcement, the measures intend to ensure safety of users��� assets in response to ���regulatory policy requirements.��� ���Further details about the shutdown will be sent out through announcements, emails, and in-site messages,��� Sparkpool noted. Launched in China in early 2018, SparkPool has emerged as one of the world���s largest mining pools for mining Ether (ETH), alongside the world���s largest Ethereum mining pool Ethermine. At the time of writing, SparkPool���s mining power makes up 22% of Ethereum���s global hash rate, slightly lower than Ethermine���s share of 24%, according to Poolwatch.io. The news comes amid the Chinese government reinforcing its negative stance on crypto by declaring all crypto-related transactions illegal in the country last Friday. Some of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Huobi have subsequently suspended new account registrations from mainland China, albeit reportedly still servicing users in Hong Kong. SparkPool did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph���s request for comment. SparkPool���s shutdown comes as Ethereum continues its switch from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake model in 2022 ��� part of the long-planned upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ether miners will not have many choices after Ethereum 2.0 finally arrives, as their mining equipment is set to become obsolete.	1
Bitcoin (BTC) prices could match their all-time high of $20,000 within the next two weeks ��� and could hit $50,000 or $100,000 by the end of the year, eToro analyst Simon Peters claimed on June 26. According to Peters, it took 7 to 14 days for BTC to reach the record figure of $20,000 when it was last at $11,800. He cautioned that his short-term prediction is based on the assumption that bitcoin maintains its current parabolic trajectory. Peters believes this rally is different from past surges because it hasn���t been accompanied by a spike in Google searches for ���buy bitcoin��� ��� indicating that the capital entering the market is coming from institutions and investors who had previously parked their funds in stablecoins. On whether the surge is sustainable, Peters added: ���With the number of sell positions building in the market it's possible we could see a correction very soon. Even if that was the case though, bitcoin continues to remain on track to close out the first half of the year on a highly positive note. We could see bitcoin reaching $50,000 or even $100,000 this year.��� The analyst went on to note that BTC���s gains are at the expense of altcoins, some of which are being ���pummeled��� as they languish at significant lows. Bitcoin���s parabolic advance continued past $12,000 on June 26 ��� the first time the cryptocurrency has hit this figure in over a year. Data from CoinMarketCap also suggests BTC has surpassed 60% market dominance for the first time since April 2017, with a capitalization of $226 billion.	2
Nov. 14: Crypto markets have suffered sharp losses over the past several hours. The major market drop off took place between 10:30 a.m. (UTC -5) and 12:00 p.m., with some of the top 20 cryptocurrencies dropping by as much as 18 percent at press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Market visualization from Coin360 According to data from Bitcointicker, after 11:00 a.m. (UTC -5) Bitcoin dropped below the $5,600  price point for the first time in 2018, sinking further to as low as $5,506 at around 2:00PM.

Technical expert Willy Woo, founder of data webstie Woobull, has recently predicted that the bear market end may end ���around Q2 2019,��� based on ���putting together the blockchain view:��� ���After that we start the true accumulation band, only after that, do we start a long grind upwards.��� Earlier this year, crypto investor and founder of Galaxy Investment Partners Mike Novogratz predicted that Bitcoin will not manage to break $10,000 by the end of 2018, claiming that reverse of the trend will take place by Q2 in 2019, when the industry will get more institutional involvement.	0
Bitcoin (BTC) led major cryptocurrencies on a fresh downward spiral July 1 after markets halted support above $12,000.  Market visualization courtesy of Coin360 Data from Coin360 shows bitcoin has lost its grip on the $11,000 mark as of press time, trading around $10,950 having gone as low as $10,680. Conditions remain volatile this week, with last week���s peak of $13,800 still unchallenged. Now, attention is turning to a long-term retracement, which one analyst claims could bring BTC/USD down to just $6,600.  Previously, talk was of a lighter correction which would focus on the $9,500 area. Bullish forecasts for further growth also began appearing, with Fundstrat���s Tom Lee leading calls for a new all-time bitcoin price high in 2019. Now, however, it would appear various factors have converged to put downward pressure on bitcoin. Among them, data shows the supply of stablecoin tether (USDT) has doubled this year; increased tether issuance tends to result in both bitcoin price gains and volatility.  Josh Rager, the analyst and investor increasingly known for his bitcoin predictions on social media, added to the overall sentiment that the cryptocurrency was about to take a break from its bull run.  On the plus side, he argued while uploading a fresh BTC price chart, lower levels would provide a fresh opportunity to accumulate coins.  ���Weekly close looks ugly, you'll likely see this shooting star type of doji��� Which typically is a signal for reversal & we could see a couple of down weeks for Bitcoin,��� he summarized.  Bitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Coin360 Regardless of price movement, bitcoin���s technical factors continue to impress, with hash rate again reaching an all-time high in recent days. As Cointelegraph previously reported, the statistic provides a reliable indication of the overall health of the bitcoin network.  After a turbulent week for traders, meanwhile, altcoins again failed to rally on Monday, instead following bitcoin to greet them with yet more losses. Ethereum (ETH) fell 5.9% to lose support at $300, while the majority of the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap saw falls of between 5% and 7%.  Ether 7-day price chart.

For Brandt, alts were experiencing their own version of the dot com boom of the early 2000s, and only a few would ultimately prevail.	0
LianLian International, a China-based payment services provider, has partnered with RippleNet in order to offer faster and less expensive cross border transactions to their customers across the US, Europe, and China, according to a Feb. 7 announcement on Ripple���s blog. RippleNet is Ripple���s decentralized global network, made up of banks and other financial institutions, that handles the real-time confirmations of financial transactions. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, tweeted that Ripple ���just opened the door to the largest e-commerce market in the world���: We just opened the door to the largest e-commerce market in the world for our #RippleNet partners with LianLian. https://t.co/R3HyqxhF9U LianLian will use Ripple���s centralized software payment solution, xCurrent, which is tailored to work with financial institutions by allowing banks to confirm payment details in real time before each transaction and after each delivery. LianLian already lists PayPal and Apple as their strategic partners, serving marketplaces like Amazon, Ali Express, and Ebay. In reference to the Ripple partnership, Arthur Zhu, CEO of LianLian, said: ���With RippleNet, we will further enhance that experience and increase our market share by offering customers instant, blockchain-powered payments across the 19 currencies that we currently support. We look forward to working with Ripple to power payment flows between China and RippleNet members in new markets.��� Ripple has partnerships with over 100 financial institutions, most recently partnering in mid-January with Moneygram to speed up fiat payments. The RippleNet and LianLian partnership comes at a time when China has been increasing crypto regulation, removing crypto-related ads on social media and search engines and banning foreign exchanges on top of the earlier domestic exchange restrictions.	2
Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Overstock, which was the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin (BTC) back in 2014, has said that he is ���not really interested in cryptocurrencies per se,��� but revealed a little-known Blockchain project his company has invested ���millions of dollars��� into in an interview with Business Insider Friday, Feb. 23. When asked if he���s interested in ���everything cryptocurrency��� or ���really interested in the Blockchain [sic]���, Byrne prefaced his answer by saying he is ���really letting something big out of the bag���,  going on to reveal both Overstock���s and his personal interest in a virtually unknown Blockchain project called Ravencoin, which launched very quietly on Jan. 3, 2018. The Ravencoin project���s single blog post, published Nov. 1, 2017, opens with a sentence designed to pique the interest of a Game of Thrones-loving crypto investor: ���In the fictional world of Westeros, ravens are used as messengers who carry statements of truth.��� The post goes on to describe Ravencoin as ���a use case specific Blockchain, designed to efficiently handle one specific function: the transfer of assets from one party to another.��� Ravencoin was first mentioned on Bitcointalk.org on Jan. 14, 2018 in a post that described its Jan. 3 launch as containing ���very little info regarding the future of the project,��� but that ���since then, several community members have learned that there is an active development team on this coin.��� Byrne told Business Insider that Overstock has put ���millions of dollars into teams��� for Ravencoin, stating confidently, ���[w]e think this coin actually has quite a future.��� Byrne then compared Ravencoin to leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, saying: ���It's Bitcoin, but a thousand times more energy efficient.��� In his interview with Business Insider, Byrne follows the project���s 4-page whitepaper in identifying the problem of the rising expenses of BTC mining and its centralization around ASIC production and cheap electricity. Byrnes claims that Ravencoin solves said problems by being ���ASIC resistant��� and ���redemocratiz[ing] mining,��� going on to describe the current concentration of industrial-level mining in China: ���Anyone can download this software, and you don't have an advantage by having this big mining warehouse in China.��� A four day old post on the /r/cryptocurrency sub-Reddit titled ���What are your thoughts on Ravencoin?��� further highlights the relatively unknown status of the project: ���This coin is very new and also implements a brand new algorithm, X16R. Surprised that there's not a single mention of it in this subreddit, even though thousands of miners are already mining this coin. Is it being kept secret to keep mining difficulty down?��� Only one person has responded so far, the day it was posted, saying: ���Never heard of it until now.��� Byrne also told Business Insider that because Overstock was the first major corporation to accept BTC as far back as 2014, the company deserves credit for keeping Bitcoin relevant: ���I like to think that we saved that community [Bitcoin] about five years in their adoption cycle.��� In early January of this year, a glitch with Overstock���s payment system inadvertently allowed customers to pay with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) interchangeably for a three-week window before the mistake was caught, charging customers in BTC or BCH at a 1:1 ratio and thus giving BCH holders a massive, unintentional discount.	1
On June 15, the cryptocurrency market experienced a major market correction as the value of leading cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Ethereum Classic and NEM sharply fell. In total, the cryptocurrency market lost around $16 bln in market cap, moving back down to $95 bln after achieving a historic milestone earlier this week by surpassing the $100 bln mark.  Cryptocurrencies, in general, had a good run and maintained strong momentum over the past few months. Bitcoin, in particular, began to receive extensive media coverage from mainstream media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and CNBC. Traditional newspapers including the WSJ continuously featured Bitcoin on their front page, comparing Bitcoin price to that of gold and reserve currencies such as the US dollar. Only four days ago, Bitcoin price established a new all-time high of $3,018. Within a week, Bitcoin price surged from around $2,300 to $3,018. However, as seen in the trend of Bitcoin price dating back to 2009, Bitcoin always had a minor market correction after establishing its new all-time high and rising to a new peak. However, Bitcoin price frequently stabilized at a region higher than the previous peak. For instance, when Bitcoin price plunged from $2,700 to $1,900 overnight amid a minor market correction, Bitcoin price established a new all-time high in the $3,000 region. Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin and security expert, told the community that it is important to consider the factors behind the surge of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin before evaluating the reasons behind their fall. Antonopoulos stated: Some of you are wondering "why are cryptos crashing like crazy?"   Yet you didn't ask "why are cryptos climbing like crazy?"   That's why He also emphasized that the cryptocurrency market and Bitcoin, in particular, have returned to more sustainable levels that will be beneficial for users, traders and investors in the long-run. Bitcoin and Ethereum amongst other cryptocurrencies and crypto assets were increasing at a rate that simply wasn���t proportional. The explosive growth of ICOs and mainstream media-produced hype led to a bubble in the cryptocurrency market and the market responded with a correction. ���We're returning to more sustainable price levels for all cryptos. In the process of reverting to the long term trendline, we will undershoot,��� Antonopoulos added. On May 28, Cointelegraph revealed that the cryptocurrency market fell drastically and suffered a major market correction as Bitcoin price fell from $2,700 to $1,926. After the initial plunge, Bitcoin recovered beyond the previous peak of $2,700 to $3,000. This pattern will repeat all the way to Bitcoin $100,000 and beyond... pic.twitter.com/o9Wj4reBtv Bitcoin price is a cycle which most investors dismiss. As seen throughout its history, Bitcoin price always recovered beyond its previous peak.	0
Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the way the world looks at transactions - but they���ve also facilitated some monumental scams over the past nine years. The success of Bitcoin and a number of altcoins jumpstarted an industry that is incorporating Blockchain technology in a number of innovative ways. While the smartest minds have created some game-changing companies backed by the power of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, nefarious minds have also jumped on the bandwagon, fleecing unwitting investors in elaborate scams. Since Bitcoin���s inception in 2009, people have become increasingly enamoured with the idea of Blockchain technology. Over time, developers and business minds began creating their own solutions with this decentralized ledger technology. This led to the development of Ethereum and other virtual currencies, with the former in part responsible for a boom in initial coin offerings (ICO) in 2017. As an ICO is essentially a round of public finding and is typically launched by a tech startup which sells inhouse cryptocurrency tokens to prospective investors, these investors buy tokens in the hopes that company will launch its product and the tokens will grow in value. An ICO is not unlike an initial public offering, which is when a traditional company makes its share available for purchase to the general public. In fact, this is where the ICO moniker stems from. Given that there are no promises that an ICO will make good on its future plans, investors take a leap of faith when they part ways with their money. This of course has led to a plethora of scams billed as ICOs, which have seen thousands of investors left out of pocket. Here are five of the biggest ICO scams in history.  The most recent large-scale ICO scam grabbed headlines in April. Two ICOs, run by the same company operating out of Vietnam, are believed to have swindled around 32,000 investors of a combined $660 mln. The company in question, Modern Tech, packed up its offices in Ho Chi Minh city last month, making off with investors money. The scam is believed to be the biggest in ICO history. A number of investors protested outside the vacant offices in the city on April 8, after the company refused to process cash withdrawals. The city���s administration has ordered police to investigate the fraud. Both ICOs have been classified as multi-level marketing scams. iFan was advertised a social media platform for celebrities to promote their content to fans. Meanwhile Pincoin was promising 40 percent monthly returns on investments made. The project claimed to be building an online platform encompassing an ad network, auction and investment portal and peer-to-peer marketplace built on Blockchain technology. OneCoin has been the subject of a number of investigations over the past 18 months. Officially labelled as a ���clear ponzi scheme��� in India in July 2017, it was fined ���2.5 mln by Italian authorities two months later. Cointelegraph has previously warned readers to stay clear of the operation, as OneCoin does not even operate a legitimate decentralized cryptocurrency. Furthermore it does not have a public ledger and its Bulgarian offices were raided in January with servers seized by authorities as international investigations and court cases continue against the company. Scandals in countries around the world summed up the fact that OneCoin is indeed a massive scam. In 2016, over $30 mln dollars were seized by Chinese authorities investigating the OneCoin operation in the country. The company claimed to be officially licensed in Vietnam last year as well, but this was later refuted by the country���s government. More than five countries have warned investors of the risks involved for those choosing to invest in the company, including Thailand, Croatia, Bulgaria, Finland and Norway. Long accused of being a ponzi scheme, Bitconnect discontinued operations in January in the wake of a cease and desist order from two American financial regulators. Users exchanged Bitcoin for Bitconnect Coin (BCC) on the Bitconnect platform, launched in Jan. 2017, and were promised astronomical returns on their investments. Furthermore the company ran a lending program, where users lent BCC out to other users to make interest depending on how much BCC they���d lent on the platform. There was also a typical, ponzi scheme referral system. Nevertheless, the wider cryptocurrency was hardly sympathetic when the operation shut down its lending scheme and exchange platform. A number of users have since launched a class action lawsuit against Bitconnect to recoup lost funds - amounting to $700,000 for their particular claim. This particular ICO was nipped in the bud in Dec. 2017 after being labelled a typical return on investment ponzi scheme. Plexcorp was promising investors over 1300 percent return on investment per month before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered the company to stop operations. Over $15 mln had been raised during the Plexcoin ICO. Luckily all of the funds were frozen by the SEC and founder Dominic Lacroix was jailed. Interestingly, it was the first time the SEC stepped in and charged an ICO through its Cyber Crime Unit. Plexcoin���s offerings was also classed as a security, hence the SEC���s decision to press charges. Having been endorsed by the likes of superstar boxer Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled, Centratech was thrust into the spotlight for its supposed Visa and MasterCard debit card service that would allow users to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat. Two of the founders have since been arrested on fraud charges relating to the ICO, which raised around $32 mln, according to Ars Technica. The SEC highlighted the extreme lengths the founders, Sohrab ���Sam����� Sharma and Robert Farkas, went to in order to dupe investors. ���The SEC also alleges that to promote the ICO, Sharma and Farkas created fictional executives with impressive biographies, posted false or misleading marketing materials to Centra���s website, and paid celebrities to tout the ICO on social media.��� The US regulator is looking to seek permanent injunctions, and intends to force Sharma and Farkas to return stolen funds with interest. The pair will also be barred from serving as company officers or directors, and be banned from participating in any securities offerings. As these five scams show, fraudsters will go to extraordinary lengths to swindle unsuspecting investors. It highlights a need for investors to do their due diligence when it comes to investment decisions. Cointelegraph reached out to American investor and founder of Skill Incubator Chris Dunn for comment on the Pincoin and iFan debacle.Overall, Dunn believes that the cryptocurrency community needs to become more discerning towards new ICOs. If not, governments around the world are likely to take sterner stances towards cryptocurrencies in general. ���The crypto community needs to promote financial education and ethical investment practices, otherwise governments will over-regulate and stifle real innovation. The most effective way to protect investors is through education. Investors need to learn how to evaluate investment opportunities, quickly spot scams, and know how to manage risk.���  Sadly, scams like these are a blemish for cryptocurrencies in general. While they operate in isolation, the fact that they ride on the cryptocurrency wave smears the wider community, which is driving innovation in a number of spaces. It provides a focus point for skeptics to attack cryptocurrencies, when in fact these scams are anything but legitimate ICOs and cryptocurrencies. What the greater public and authorities need to avoid is assuming that ICOs are all cut from the same cloth. Undoubtedly, there are criminals looking to take advantage of the hype of a new technology. However that does not take away from the sterling work of some of the brightest minds in the IT industry.	0
IBM and Danish transport and logistics company Maersk announced Jan. 16 that they are teaming up to create an as-yet-unnamed Blockchain-based shipping and supply chain company. The goal of the venture is to commercialize Blockchain for all aspects of the global supply chain system, from shipping to ports, and banks to customs offices. Blockchain technology is uniquely able to provide special control for the logistics industry, since it can replace tedious and insecure paperwork with secure digital records that are also transparent. Maersk���s chief commercial officer Vincent Clerc, who will serve as chairman of the newly formed board for the joint venture, was quoted in the official announcement saying: ���The potential from offering a neutral, open digital platform for safe and easy ways of exchanging information is huge, and all players across the supply chain stand to benefit.��� The company had promised to make delivery of the new project by the end of last year. The offering is the fulfillment of a year���s worth of planning by both companies, each of whom have invested in Blockchain in various other ways as well. The joint venture is hoping to start offering their software solutions by Q3 2018.	2
Forbes, known for its ���World���s Billionaires List���, published a list of the richest people in cryptocurrency for the first time, Tuesday Feb. 6. The goal of publishing such a list, according to Forbes Editor Randall Lane, is to ���[provide] a snapshot of a pivotal moment, part of the transparency needed to pull crypto away from its provenance as the favorite currency of drug dealers and into the adolescence of a legitimate asset class.��� While compiling a list of the world���s traditional billionaires is a relatively straightforward task, calculating the exact amount of wealth of the world���s richest crypto tycoons is more difficult. Cryptocurrencies are by definition a decentralized, encrypted payment system that began outside of the traditional global financial system. The ���newly minted crypto rich,��� as described by Forbes staff writer Jeff Kauflin, ���live in a strange milieu that blends paranoid secrecy with ostentatious display.��� The Forbes ���Richest People in Cryptocurrency��� list is broken up into five categories: ���idealists, builders, opportunists, infrastructure players and establishment investors.��� In order to make the Forbes list, one must have accrued over $350 million. Instead of static numbers, the net worths of the people on the list are listed in ranges, calculated based on the ���estimated holdings of cryptocurrencies (a few provided proof), post-tax profits from trading crypto-assets and stakes in crypto-related businesses.��� Forbes acknowledges that they could have left some people off the list and that their estimates may be ���wide of the mark.��� The list contains 19 people. One can click on each member of the list on Forbes���s website in order to see a short bio and an estimated crypto net worth. Other data was published along with the list, like the average age of crypto���s richest compared to the age of Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans (42 vs. 67), and the average daily price volatility in January 2018 for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) compared to Apple, Proctor & Gamble, and gold. When creating the list, Lane spoke with Joe Lubin, the founder of Consensys, about other crypto tycoons��� potential concerns about releasing such data. Lubin, who Lane referred to as the ���statesman of cryptocurrency���, said that he and his peers weren���t looking for public attention. Lubin also questioned how Forbes could arrive at any accurate numbers, and brought up the issues of potentially targeting these people for theft. However, Lane adds that Lubin and his ���crypto elite��� peers did recognize the list���s importance. Kauflin writes that Forbes, ���firmly believe we made the world a better place by shining a light on the invisible rich. Just as crypto has evolved from the days of the Silk Road drug site and the Mt. Gox digital hijacking, fortunes of this magnitude should never be allowed to lurk in the shadows.��� CryptoWeekly, a cryptocurrency newsletter, released a comparable list of the top 100 most influential people in the crypto community. Their list is factored not by net worth, but by the research and technological contributions a person has made in the world of crypto. Among those who were left out of Forbes��� richest in crypto rankings, but included in the CryptoWeekly influential list, are important crypto players like Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, and crypto pioneer Nick Szabo, among others.	1
As January closed, Bitcoin fell towards $9,000 (getting closer to $8,000 in the first days of February). It has been a particularly tough month and a half for Bitcoin if one considers that halfway through December the coin peaked at $20,000. The market has taken hit after hit in the days following its downward spiral from the aforementioned high, the only issue is that some of these catalyzing factors have been paper tigers or even worse, fake news. In a speculative market such as the Bitcoin one, which welcomed a massive influx of relatively clueless speculators in the hype-rush to $20,000, bad news is especially bad news and damaging to investor confidence. Halfway through January, there was a bout of confusion that came out of South Korea, an important Bitcoin hub in the east, as the Ministry of Justice, which independently announced its plans of banning cryptocurrency trading. This sent panic across the markets, in a similar fashion as to when China announced it banning plans. However, it has since been cleared up by much higher authorities, and in fact, the sentiment out of South Korea has been pretty positive following this market scare. In fact, this move was even classed as insider trading as many fought back against the supposed planned FUD attack. Regardless of the clearing up, and the clouds parting over the Asian nation, the damage was still done. The markets managed to claw their way back somewhat, but there was soon more damaging news of questionable integrity to send the speculators fleeing. In the US, the fear, uncertainty and doubt showed its face when it emerged that there was a subpoena out for Bitfinex and Tether. The former a major exchange and the latter a token issuer. This sent ripples of panic across the community as it again showed that the regulators who have been classed as enemy number one, where on their feet and clamping down. According to the report, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was sending subpoenas to these two companies, which strangely, were not even US-based companies, pulling alternative questions about jurisdiction also to the fore. However, after the market took an 11 percent tumble at this news, it emerged that these subpoenas had already been issued, back in early December, according to Nathaniel Popper, a reporter from New York Times. Again, the effect of negative news was apparent, and its validity seemingly unimportant as the markets doubled for a reason that was not even relevant or related. The last bout of misinformation that had its say on the markets came out of India where a simple case of misreading stirred even more panic. Mainstream media, rushing to get the news out, seemingly misinterpreted a government speech on regulation. The line in question, from finance minister Arun Jaitley, read: ���The government does not recognize cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.��� However, this was then blown up into: ���Arun Jaitley has just killed India���s cryptocurrency party,��� by a Quartz���s article on the subject. The line in equation states that the regulators in India are aiming to eliminate the use of cryptocurrencies to fund illegal activities but avoids mentioning the full legality of digital currencies.  There can be no doubting the power of persuasion and the extent that bad news can affect a market as speculative as Bitcoin���s. And, to this end, as more bad news, fake, real, old or late, piles on top of an already fragile confidence, the damage gets exaggerated. Many are hoping for one piece of positivity to right all the wrongs that have been leveled at the digital currency, and for the market to react accordingly. However, what that news could be remains a mystery.	0
Ran Neuner, the host of CNBC���s show Cryptotrader and the 28th most influential Blockchain insider according to Richtopia, made a tweet Thursday, Feb. 1 claiming that Bitcoin will end 2018 at the price point of $50,000. The CNBC channel has been increasingly involved in cryptocurrency reporting over the past few months. On Jan. 8, the cable network aired a  step-by-step tutorial on how to buy Ripple using the Poloniex exchange as a platform for the purchase. Host Brian Kelly demonstrated the entire process live on the channel. In December 2017, an issue of CNBC���s Fast Money mentioned Bitcoin Cash both on air and on its social media accounts. The show made a tweet with two charts that showed a decline in Bitcoin���s price and an increase in that of Bitcoin Cash, adding ���Bitcoin Cash is here��� deal with it!��� @rogerkver aka Bitcoin Jesus joins us tomorrow to discuss the biggest change to the crypto world since time was invented! Must see TV.. #BitcoinCash is here... deal with it!! pic.twitter.com/k9kO30nwKF The tweet was met with a mixed response from the cryptocurrency community, some users expressing their disagreement with the network���s message. shame on you for promoting this bitcoincash/bcash fake scam coin As Bitcoin reached a multi-month low on Friday, Neuner���s latest prediction has similarly resulted in a mixed reaction with one reply sarcastically highlighting the low probability of Bitcoin���s price hitting the exact mark of $50,000 on Dec. 31, 2018. Well, the odds of it being exactly 50.000$ at 23:59 on Dec 31st are actually very slim.	2
The latest news from China has ���sweetened��� reports all exchange should close by September 30, giving Huobi and Okcoin an extra month of life. Reports from local news outlet Caixin suggest the two exchanges��� lack of ICO offerings was one of the factors allowing them to continue operating longer than others. Okcoin and Huobi can stay open 1 month longer. https://t.co/oA6GsbJX2L pic.twitter.com/fYsbIzT9Ih ���Because the two platforms have large numbers of users and have not performed ICO operations, the relevant departments have given Huobi and Okcoin a one-month buffer period to stay open until the end of October before shutting down,��� the paper states. Specific proposals are still being ���studied,��� it added. The highly volatile Bitcoin market reacted almost instantly to the news, climbing around $400 in minutes from lows of $2972.  The early updates received mixed reviews, however, with some social media commentators suggesting it is a way for Chinese regulators to prolong market manipulation. Official confirmations are still yet to surface regarding obligatory closure for remaining exchanges by September 30.	0
Antshares, the China-based open-source Blockchain platform, is trying to position itself as the country���s version of one of the known digital cryptocurrency platforms, Ethereum. As part of its rebranding, the platform will be renamed as NEO by the end of 2017. Antshares/NEO has already gained a foothold in the country. Its own currency called ANS is already used in the majority of stock exchanges across China. Just like Ethereum, owners of the ANS tokens can use them to pay for transaction gas. Meanwhile, the team behind the Antshares project is collaborating with Chinese certificate authorities in mapping a real-world asset utilizing Antshares��� smart contract technology called Smart Contracts 2.0. The project has also signed up several new startup companies as partners, with plans to add other partners as the project progresses. Moreover, the Antshares team has patented a cross-chain interoperability, which is expected to benefit the project in the long term. There are several differences between Ethereum and Antshares, particularly in the technology by which they are built, and more specifically, their programming language. Antshares is compatible with all coding languages, while Ethereum only works with Solidity. Antshares��� compatibility with all languages is expected to generate a bigger following of users. Among the similarities of Ethereum and Antshares is their ability to combine gas or fees, smart contracts and possibly even DApps. It is, however, still too early to tell whether Antshares can eventually successfully become the Ethereum of China and dominate the Chinese market. Antshares is a subsidiary of Onchain, which is among the well-respected brands in China. The project has already obtained millions of dollars in funding, with its market capitalization already totaling more than $250 mln. With this amount of money, Antshares already has the capability to advance its technology for years to come. It is, however, interesting to see if this will successfully make it China���s Ethereum.	1
Bitcoin is paradoxically becoming more valuable the more it dies, with over 200 ���obituaries��� now public. The bizarre status quo comes from information portal 99Bitcoins, which also tracks press articles declaring Bitcoin will shortly disappear. On Dec. 1, as Bitcoin prices hovered at just over $10,000, the site���s ���Bitcoin obituary stats��� formally recorded the 200th Bitcoin death. The omen came courtesy of Business Insider, which produced an article claiming a ���fatal flaw��� meant no cryptocurrency could ever become ���real��� currency. ���A currency has to be a widely used medium of exchange. Cryptocurrencies are never going to achieve that. Period,��� UBS Bank���s Wealth Management Global Chief Economist Paul Donovan told the publication. "...The fatal issue for cryptocurrencies is that the supply of them can only ever go up. There is unlimited upside to the supply of cryptocurrencies." The number of warnings appearing in mainstream media publications especially about Bitcoin���s impending doom is considerably higher than 200, yet those calling the death nail for Bitcoin and its ilk are more selective. Talk of a bubble, in which Bitcoin would lose the majority of its value suddenly once prices reach a certain level, is all-pervasive this month as $11,000 comes and goes several times. On that subject, NEO���s Founder Da Hongfei told CNBC this week that even if a bubble did ���pop,��� this would ultimately be ���OK,��� as the industry would then rebound stronger in future.    Secret symbol ��� 23: Q What is this?	1
The US state of Georgia is the next state in line to possibly accept cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment for state taxes and licenses, according to a bill introduced on Feb. 21. Senate Bill 464, introduced by Republican state senators, Joshua McKoon and Michael Williams, proposes that ���[t]he commissioner shall accept as valid payment for taxes and license fees any cryptocurrency, including but not limited to Bitcoin, that uses an electronic peer-to-peer  system.��� The bill stipulates that once payments are received, the commissioner will convert the cryptocurrency to US dollars within a period no longer than 24 hours. This new legislation comes on the heels of very similar measures undertaken Arizona���s state senate in bill passed earlier this month, allowing that, ���[a] taxpayer may pay their income tax liability using a payment gateway, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, or any other cryptocurrency recognized by the department, using electronic peer-to-peer systems.��� The Arizona bill also stipulates that crypto will be converted to US dollars within 24 hours. Having already passed its third reading by a narrow margin, Arizona may be one of the first US states to accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments. Wyoming also recently introduced legislation that would exempt cryptocurrencies from being taxed as property, which has been crypto���s federal classification since 2014. A group of mostly republicans introduced bill SF0111, which proposes a list of ���intangible items���, among which are cryptocurrencies, gold, and cashier���s checks, which would be exempt from property taxes. While initially the news may seem like a boon for crypto users, tax law expert Robert Wood wrote in an expert take for Cointelegraph that using cryptocurrencies to pay taxes could actually lead to paying more taxes, since gains in cryptocurrencies used for tax payments could themselves be subject to capital gains tax and investment income tax.	0
Cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) shot up by almost 35 percent over the past 24 hours, trading at an average of $2.20 and occupying second place by market cap in the overall crypto market at press time. The massive spike comes just over a week after the coin broke $1 for the first time last Thursday. The price then dropped again on Dec. 22, but rallied back up 57 percent the same day and has been following a bullish run since blowing past $1.50 today.  With a market cap now of $78 bln- Ripple is worth more than Uber, valued at $68 bln as of December 2017 according to the Wall Street Journal. The cryptocurrency was trading stably at about $0.20 for the past six months, starting its notable growth on Dec. 12.  The investment profitability of Ripple, created in 2013, this year has surpassed that of Bitcoin.	2
Bitcoin has prided itself on not being moved by the normal market manipulators, such as global strife and socioeconomic activities. However, there are times when it fluctuates for obscure reasons. According to some experts, the January downturn could be no surprise as he attributes it to the Lunar New Year and the significance it carries for the Chinese. The lead up to Chinese New Year is one of high spending as people book all sorts of travel and holidays, not to mention buy presents. Thus, just like Christmas and December is a time for spending in the West, January has a similar pattern in the east. With Bitcoin���s value almost halving from $20,000 in the middle of December to $10,000 at its worst in January, Wallin is both unperturbed or surprised. ���The January drop is a recurring theme in cryptocurrencies as people celebrating the Chinese New Year, aka Lunar New Year, exchange their crypto for fiat currency,��� explains Alexander Wallin, CEO of trading social network SprinkleBit, as quoted by Bloomberg. ���The timing is about four to six weeks before the lunar year when most people make their travel arrangements and start buying presents,��� he added. The holiday takes place on Feb. 16; however, the build-up is where people start to spend their money. And with the Chinese population heavily vested in Bitcoin, it has a huge role to play on the movement of the market. The thoughts are that people have been taking their profits into the build-up of the New Year, turning their Bitcoin into fiat currency to use for gift buying. Bitcoin is steadfast in the face of other market influences, the likes that are seen to disturb the traditional stock market, etc. But this theory, if it is to be believed, highlights the way in which Bitcoin moves separately from other assets. In August, when tensions between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un were reaching a fever pitch, the entire global market fell by an average of one percent. However, Bitcoin was one of the only assets to report growth during that period. While it may be hard to blame the market decline on something as otherworldly as the moon, there is some evidence to suggest that January is not a good time to be invested in Bitcoin.     There are not too many patterns that have emerged in Bitcoin���s price graph over its short lifespan. However, there does seem to be some sort of correlation between this time of year. What is at least pleasing, if there is a pattern, is that a big rally often follows the January dip.	1
Super Bowl LII, the US NFL championship game played yesterday, Feb. 4 between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots, featured a television ad from brokerage firm TD Ameritrade that advertised Bitcoin (BTC) futures. Singer Lionel Richie appeared in the US-based brokerage firm���s ad describing a customer���s ability to trade 24 hours a day, 5 days a week while, frustratingly, avoiding using the title of his 1983 hit song, ���All Night Long (All Night).��� The ad, which played immediately after the national anthem, ended with the company���s logo and the phrase, ���Bitcoin futures available. Fiesta forever���:  Super Bowl ads have become a tradition separate from the football game, with viewers expecting companies to make their ads more entertaining, filled with more celebrities, and extra thought-provoking every year. Time Magazine reports that a 30-second Super Bowl ad now costs around $5 mln. Bitcoin futures trading is relatively new in the world markets, with CBOE launching the first BTC futures contract in December 2017 and experiencing an immediate website crash due to high traffic. CME Group launched the world���s second BTC futures contract shortly after CBOE���s, also in December 2017.	2
Starting in February, no-cost stock trading app Robinhood will allow users to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum with no fees whatsoever, the company has announced in a blog post Thursday, Jan. 25. The announcement is a welcome one to users of other cryptocurrency exchanges who have grown accustomed to paying fees ranging from 0.1% to as high as 4% per transaction on platforms like Coinbase. Robinhood is also allowing users to track the price of a number of other cryptocurrencies including Ripple and Litecoin, although the actual trading feature will only be available for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company���s intention is to use the zero-fee cryptocurrency trading feature as a ���loss-leader���, allowing it to bring more traders onto its platform, which can already boast more than 3 mln users. Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev told TechCrunch: ���We���re planning to operate this business on break even basics and we don���t plan to profit from it for the foreseeable future. The value of Robinhood Crypto is in growing our customer base and better serving our existing customers.��� Additionally, by offering simple-to-use analysis and transaction tools, the company hopes to pull in more users as well. ���We believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to fundamentally reorganize the way money works from the ground up, putting power previously held by financial institutions directly in the hands of the people,��� Robinhood added in its announcement.	2
The incoming Biden administration���s plan to flood the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars could ignite the next leg of the Bitcoin (BTC) bull market, as more investors seek refuge from a crumbling United States dollar.  Axios, an Arlington-based news outlet, reported Thursday that Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide Americans with $2,000 in stimulus payments to help offset the economic devastation of Covid-19. The incoming president has also proposed a $3 trillion tax and infrastructure package as part of his ���Build Back Better��� program.  Biden doubled down on his call for more direct relief to Americans following Friday���s disappointing jobs report showing a loss of 140,000 positions in December.  He said: If 2020 is anything to go by, the new tidal wave of stimulus could be another catalyst for Bitcoin as more money floods the market and makes its way into asset prices.  Even Donald Trump, a Republican, was no stranger to vast government outlays. Under his leadership, the United States passed a historic $2 trillion stimulus bill in March. Trump also signed a $900 billion relief package last month that would pave the way for $600 stimulus checks.  The federal government���s inflation-boosting policies have coincided with record intervention from the Federal Reserve, which deployed trillions of dollars in 2020 to combat a liquidity crisis and keep overnight rates under control.  Although these policies provided a strong backstop for risk-on assets ��� a category that has included Bitcoin in the past ��� the emerging narrative surrounding BTC is that it���s a hedge against inflation.  This is not only corroborated by Bitcoin���s historic outperformance over the past 11 years but also by the fresh wave of institutional money entering the market. Institutions are buying Bitcoin with a clear purpose, and may one day become the industry���s ���mega HODLers.��� Bitcoin���s digital gold narrative has been one of the biggest catalysts behind the institutional shift towards BTC. This narrative helped fuel Bitcoin's 300% rally in 2020 and its more than doubling in price over the past three weeks. This trend could intensify in 2021 as the dollar's purchasing power continues to erode.  Even JPMorgan Chase has acknowledged that Bitcoin is taking market share from gold, the traditional haven asset. On Friday, one Bitcoin was worth more than 22 ounces of gold, which represents a new all-time high.	2
Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is still down nearly 48 hours after the site initiated a system upgrade. Kraken engineers had estimated the downtime would only be two hours. Much like Gilligan���s three-hour cruise that went horribly wrong, Kraken users all over the Internet are raging over the downtime and asking difficult questions. Nearly all digital currency exchanges have faced significant growing pains in the last year, as the interest in cryptocurrencies has grown exponentially. Coinbase and Bitstamp have been overwhelmed with user traffic, leading to delays. Bitfinex has been hit by DDOS attacks and recently had to stop registration for new users because of overwhelming demand. Binance and Bittrex have also halted new user signups. Still, Kraken has arguably suffered the most problems of all major exchanges. Users, including myself, have experienced multiple connection errors and extraordinary difficulties placing and cancelling orders. It���s sometimes necessary to refresh Kraken���s page 10-15 times before being able to execute an action. Numerous users have complained that Kraken posted their orders multiple times (after telling them their order failed initially), in some cases costing them thousands of dollars. While many have encouraged users of Kraken to go elsewhere, it���s not always that easy. US users are particularly limited in the exchanges they can use, particularly with Bitfinex ditching them earlier last year. For certain altcoins, US traders may only be able to use Kraken to trade them against fiat. Likewise, Kraken is one of the only markets where US residents can long or short Bitcoin. Such users were delighted when, on December 15, Kraken announced a major upgrade to fix the site���s usability problems: ���Kraken.com performance is extremely degraded and unreliable.  Clients can expect severe latency and difficulty interacting with all web and API services.  Requests will frequently timeout and fail.  At the moment, the only solution is to wait and try again later. Next week we will be rolling out a major systems upgrade which should resolve these scaling and load issues.  The upgrade is long overdue and has been substantially delayed by the diversion of resources toward the protracted fire fighting effort required to deal with the last several months of unrelenting growth.��� The upgrade scheduled for the third week of December was rescheduled twice, before finally commencing January 10 at 9 PM PST. The status page Kraken set up for the upgrade stated: ���We are performing a system upgrade on Thursday, January 11 at approximately 5:00 UTC (Wednesday January 10 at 9 pm PT). Kraken services will be offline for about 2 hours during the upgrade, possibly longer.��� Over the next two days, Kraken has continued to update the status page, complaining of late starts and the upgrade progressing more slowly than expected. Finally, they announced that the upgrade was in its final stages, before then posting that ���a number of issues��� came up in their ���final testing.��� Kraken is not clear on why this ���final testing��� was apparently done on production servers. About one day after the two hour upgrade began, Kraken posted: ���We are making progress on the few remaining issues but don't have a definite launch time yet. We intend to cancel stale (and possibly all) orders and pause liquidations upon resuming service. More details to follow soon. Thank you for your patience.��� It���s unclear exactly how this will work. The price of Bitcoin and altcoins has of course changed over the last two days, and nobody is quite sure how Kraken will keep people from losing money on long and short positions that might have been closed had the exchange been working properly. Most astonishing of all, about 36 hours after the upgrade began, Kraken apparently sent their engineers home to take a nap! Kraken writes: ���We are close but rather than launch immediately ahead of the team passing out, we will push off a bit to get some rest and be able to better monitor systems and react to problems following launch. Unfortunately, this means several more hours of delay.��� At press time, Kraken is still down with no ETA for resumption of trading, and the exchange has not responded to our requests for comment. Update Jan. 13: the system upgrade on Kraken has been finished and the exchange has come back online.	0
Tuesday will see the launch of Super Bitcoin, a new hard fork which developers say will ���make Bitcoin great again.��� One of a handful of forks due to diverge from the Bitcoin core chain this month, Super Bitcoin is a Chinese effort looking to optimize Bitcoin through measures such as Lightning Network and an 8-megabyte block size. The new chain���s network snapshot is set for block 498,888, to occur during Tuesday, Dec. 12. Explaining the impetus behind their decision to create the new fork, developers said they were acting according to ideas from the ���Bitcoin community.��� ���Please remember: ���This is just an experiment,������ the project���s website advises. ���We are merely implementing the proposals recommended by the Bitcoin community. Only when we put these talks into actions that we can make Bitcoin great again.��� Broadly following Bitcoin-esque attributes, Super Bitcoin is nonetheless notable for its supply 21,210,000, which includes 210,000 pre-mined coins. ���The 210,000 pre-mined tokens will be managed by the Super BTC Foundation and are mainly used to encourage early developers, invest in the super BTC ecosystem and ensure the operation of the Super BTC Foundation,��� the website explains. Major Bitcoin mining pools f2pool and BTCC are allegedly slated to support the fork, while 21 exchanges will notionally offer trading, according to listings. December also sees the birth of new Bitcoin ���versions��� with names including Bitcoin Uranium, Bitcoin Cash Plus and even Bitcoin God.	1
A joint report by Center on Sanctions & Illicit Finance and Elliptic, a cryptocurrency forensics firm, has indicated that Bitcoin laundering for illicit drug activity is a highly centralized process. The report���s authors, Yaya Fanusi and Tom Robinson, indicate that much of illicit Bitcoin is laundered through mixers, saying: ���Mixers have consistently processed about a quarter of incoming illicit Bitcoins per year. The proportion laundered through exchanges and gambling combined has been roughly constant (66 to 72 percent). Of note, Bitcoin exchanges processed 45 percent of laundered Bitcoins, but, as they received much higher volumes, a much lower proportion of their activity is illicit.��� The report also indicated that the vast bulk of those mixer and gambling laundering schemes occur through just three sites. In fact, the report indicates that ���97 percent of the volume in their categories and 50 percent of the volume overall��� is processed by these few sites. Metropolitan Bank recently ceased wire transfers for cryptocurrencies, due to the increasing risk of money laundering and other illicit activities being conducted through Bitcoin. At the same time, China has sought to close ���exchange-like��� sites for Bitcoin, believing greater regulation and control are critical.	0
In a move that shouldn���t stun most BTC and cryptocurrency followers, Rothschild has purchased Bitcoin via the GBTC (Bitcoin Investment Trust) investment vehicle.   SEC articles signed on Friday indicate that Rothschild has diversified into cryptocurrencies, now owning $210,000 worth of GBTC. The disclosure was published via Twitter: BREAKING: Rothschild Buy $BTC Bitcoin via $GBTC Bitcoin Investment Trust 539 SH https://t.co/2jm71uscCF /// https://t.co/gJ4z93rKld The move should not come as a surprise given the widespread and increasing support of Bitcoin among institutional investors and hedge funds. The market had reacted with strong negativity after the fears of a potential breakdown in support of the BIP 91 and SegWit by miners. However, the market has since responded rapidly, increasing the prices of Bitcoin to close the week nearly 40 percent up from the lows of last weekend. The price of Bitcoin is a point of contention, with some saying that the bubble has come and a collapse is imminent, while others are suggesting that the price may skyrocket into the $5,000 range. Regardless of where the price goes, the fact that investors like Rothschild are beginning to diversify into BTC and other cryptocurrencies should bolster support for valuations.

China���s second largest cryptocurrency exchange BTCChina has announced it is shutting down on Sept. 30. In tweets Thursday, the exchange, which also comprises an international arm BTCC, said the move was a direct result of Chinese regulatory statements. It added BTCC would continue operating as normal. 2/ BTCC products, including BTCC Pool, are not affected by this change. Please contact us at support@btcc.com if you have any questions. https://t.co/r3HvINU20p Bitcoin continues to decline in price in the aftermath of China banning ICOs, and rumors circulating of a second ban on Bitcoin-to-fiat exchange. BTCC initially said it would ���change its business model��� in the event of a ban, and a potential full closure will come as a surprise to the industry. Mainstream press sources had also prophesied a ban on exchanges, leading to widespread criticism in the face of non-official statements explicitly demanding closure. Data from Bitcointicker shows prices dipping under $3700 meanwhile, with major support only hiding at the $3000 mark according to an analyst reported by Cointelegraph yesterday.	0
Blockchain-based payments firm Ripple Labs has now registered a business in Wyoming. According to records from the Wyoming Secretary of State, Ripple Markets WY LLC���s status as a local business is listed as "active" after an initial filing in February 2020. As a limited liability company in Wyoming, Ripple���s registered agent will be based in Cheyenne. ���More crypto companies are realizing Wyoming is a better domicile than Delaware due to our crypto-friendly laws,��� said Caitlin Long on Twitter.  Long is the CEO of digital bank Avanti Bank & Trust and associated with the state legislature���s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation. She said crypto firms like Ripple should consider relocating to Wyoming due to the state not having any corporate or franchise taxes, and cryptocurrencies being exempt from property and sales tax.  In addition, there is the presence of U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis. The Wyoming lawmaker is one of the first to say digital assets will be a key part of her legislative agenda. Responding to the Ripple news, Lummis' state policy director said many people were "maximalist on Wyoming." It does not appear as if Ripple will move its headquarters to the crypto-friendly state as its principal office is still listed as San Francisco. However, both Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and CEO Brad Garlinghouse have said that they are displeased with the seeming lack of regulatory clarity on crypto and blockchain in the United States. Wyoming is becoming one of the most attractive U.S. states for crypto and blockchain firms. Last year, the Wyoming State Banking Board granted crypto exchange Kraken a charter to operate as a crypto-friendly bank and gave Avanti the green light to receive and custody crypto in a similar fashion. In the wake of Tesla's $1.5 billion Bitcoin (BTC) purchase earlier this month, Senator Lummis invited CEO Elon Musk to consider relocating to the state. Cointelegraph reached out to Ripple for comment, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.	2
The influence of Reddit���s r/Wallstreetbets subreddit has apparently spread to the cryptocurrency space, after a new coin appeared at the top of CoinMarketCap���s rankings on Friday. Dubbed WallStreetBets (WSB), the new coin apparently gained in excess of 130% in the past 24 hours, with a daily trade volume of $100 million.  However, the new coin appears to be the latest in a series of jokes played by the CoinMarketCap team. The coin���s page on CMC features the following message: The reference to Charmander-marth links to a YouTube video featuring Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya being interviewed by CNBC regarding his successful trading of GameStop stocks during the short-squeeze initiated by the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit.  The coin���s CMC page offers up a brief timeline of the GameStop saga, describing the short-squeeze tactic and the subsequent effect it had on the Robinhood trading app, which suspended retail trading for GameStop and several other stocks, including AMC, Nokia and Blackberry. Clicking the link to the coin���s white paper links to the Twitter page of "MuzlM_Trader," whose tweet also drew attention to Chamath Palihapitiya���s appearance on CNBC. Bruhhh he keeps exposing their shit you heard it from @chamath the market is different and will continue to be volatile moving into the future... whose ready to be rich???? $cciv $gme $nakd $nok $Tesla etc... pic.twitter.com/Chake5mkTF The influence of the subreddit on the cryptocurrency space was also witnessed in the price surge initiated by Dogecoin (DOGE), which briefly broke into the market capitalization top 10 following a 570% increase in its spot price. DOGE's surge was also orchestrated on Reddit.	1
After only three days accepting Dogecoin (DOGE) as a form of payment, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is predicting the price of the token will eventually hit $1.  In a Saturday tweet, Cuban said customers had used more than 20,000 Dogecoin ��� roughly $1,018 at the time of publication ��� in transactions for the Dallas Mavericks, claiming the franchise was now ���the largest Dogecoin merchant in the world." The billionaire predicted that if basketball fans were to purchase 6,556,000,000 DOGE worth of Mavericks merchandise, the price of the token would ���definitely hit $1.��� The @dallasmavs have done more than 20,000 #Dogecoin in transactions, making us the LARGEST #DOGECOIN MERCHANT IN THE WORLD ! We thank all of you and can only say that if we sell another 6,556,000,000 #DOGECOIN worth of Mavs merch, #dogecoin will DEFINITELY HIT $1 !!! The Mavericks were one of the first NBA franchises to recognize crypto as a form of payment for tickets and merchandise, having started accepting Bitcoin (BTC) through wallet company BitPay two years ago. Mavericks fans can also pay for gear and souvenirs with Bitcoin Cash (BCH), USD Coin (USDC), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Paxos Standard (PAX) and Binance USD (BUSD). Despite being created as a joke, DOGE has surged in the last few months as billionaires including Cuban and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have mentioned the token on social media. Musk���s tweets have likely contributed to the price of the token rising from $0.01 in January to an all-time high of $0.078. At the time of publication, the DOGE price is $0.0509, meaning the token would need to surge 1,864% to reach $1. The Dallas Mavericks owner previously described DOGE as an "economics teaching tool," saying the token was the "best entertainment bang for your buck available" on the crypto market. Even with the surge in DOGE payments for the basketball franchise, Cuban said he was still "having fun" and hasn't changed his opinions about the token.	2
According to a security analyst, sensitive personal information for over half a billion Facebook users was leaked on a well-trafficked hacking forum earlier today ��� a potential risk to millions of cryptocurrency traders and hodlers who now may be vulnerable to sim swapping and other identity-based attacks.  The trove of information was first discovered by Alon Gal, CTO of security firm Hudson Rock, who posted on Twitter about the leak earlier today: All 533,000,000 Facebook records were just leaked for free.This means that if you have a Facebook account, it is extremely likely the phone number used for the account was leaked.I have yet to see Facebook acknowledging this absolute negligence of your data. https://t.co/ysGCPZm5U3 pic.twitter.com/nM0Fu4GDY8 According to Gal, the leak is related to a security vulnerability first discovered in 2019. In January 2021, it became known that hackers were able to use the information to access user's phone numbers; the leak has now expanded to include ���Phone number, Facebook ID, Full name, Location, Past Location, Birthdate, (Sometimes) Email Address, Account Creation Date, Relationship Status, Bio.��� According to Gal, the information could now enable hackers and scammers to deploy a variety of social manipulation exploits and other nefarioustactics:  Cryptocurrency users are at particular risk of such attacks. Earlier this year, a victim of a sim-swapping attack sued mobile phone company T-Mobile for $450,000, and in 2018 Kaspersky Labs found that hackers were able to steal 21,000 ETH, currently worth over $43 million, in social engineering attacks over a 12-month period.  The data breach is also orders of magnitude larger than the Ledger breach late last year. Shortly after over 270,000 users��� information was leaked online, users reported extortionist threats, and considered lawsuits against the hardware wallet company.	1
Bitcoin (BTC) is looking like it will hit $75,000 ��� and that could happen ���within weeks,��� one analyst has found.  Uploading a fresh BTC/USD price chart to Twitter on June 7, Cane Island Alternative Advisors��� Timothy Peterson unearthed an uncanny similarity to Bitcoin in 2013. Tracking Bitcoin���s price recovery from its lows of $3,600 in mid-March, Peterson noted that its recovery almost exactly tracked price action from seven years ago.  The result, he argued, could keep up the copycat move: BTC topped out at $1,300 in 2013, and a similar 700% bull run at today���s prices would give a target of $75,000. ���The 2020 #bitcoin recovery has tracked the 2013a recovery almost perfectly,��� he summarized.   ���Are we weeks away from $75,000?���  Bitcoin price chart showing various recoveries. Source: Timothy Peterson/ Twitter While such a spike seems unlikely, Bitcoin is already exhibiting strong signs that it is in recovery mode from lows that will never reappear. Specifically, miner activity and associated data have mimicked December 2018, when Bitcoin bounced out of a year-long bear market at $3,100. Nonetheless, comparing today���s Bitcoin market with that of 2013 is all but impossible. At the time, Mt. Gox was the only major exchange, itself imploding to cause a massive price crash. Many argue that Mt. Gox was responsible for the run to $1,300. Other analysts are much more sober on the outlook for 2020. According to Cointelegraph Markets��� filbfilb, there is little consensus around a major breakout above even $10,000 this year. To seal a stronger market, BTC/USD would need to find support at $10,500, something which has eluded bulls since last year.	2
John McAfee, founder of McAfee Associates a well-known software company has always been Bullish on Bitcoin, in fact, he has even been confrontational on the fact. In July, with a lot of fear and uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin ahead of its Aug. 1 chain split, McAfee came forward and stated boldly that he was willing to stake his name and up to $10 mln on a bet that the Bitcoin price will move above $500,000 within three years or he would "eat my d**k on national television." That prediction was seen as ludacris at the time, and many were left wondering how his on-screen promise would play out - however, now that Bitcoin has crossed $11,000, McAfee is not sitting back smugly, but rather raising the bar. The outspoken tech mogul has now said: ���When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 mln by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong.��� When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bircoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong. pic.twitter.com/WVx3E71nyD With the feeling being that Bitcoin has truly crossed the mainstream adoption threshold, and the dam wall has broken, many big-name players have lent their thoughts to a predicted target. Ronnie Moas, famed stock picker, has tried to remain ahead of the curve, changing his prediction three times in the month of November already. He began at $11,000 for the new year but then changed it to $14,000, before now settling on $20,000 for a split-adjusted price. Tom Lee, much more cautiously, said: ���Bitcoin fell to $5,600 and since then rebounded. In our view, this move to $5,600 cleaned up weak hands and we no longer feel caution is warranted. ��� We recommend steady buying of Bitcoin at these levels." He went on to predict 40 percent growth in seven months, but in all reality, Bitcoin fell short $200 of his $11,500 target this week. Max Keiser is another one who has made a big and bold prediction, although it is only one-tenth of McAfee as he says Bitcoin at $100,000 is an eventuality. Secret symbol ��� 16: v What is this?	2
Dogecoin, which started as a parody cryptocurrency, has now broken the $1 bln market cap showing how far virtual currencies have come since Bitcoin���s inception in 2009. Four years after the Bitcoin genesis block was mined, programmer Billy Markus coded his very own cryptocurrency in 2013. With the help of Jackson Palmer, a product manager and data analyst at Adobe, Dogecoin was brought to life, meme and all. Taking up the popular internet meme of the Shiba Inu dog, the creator envisioned the cryptocurrency to be a friendly online payment system, although its rise in popularity may not have been intended. Nevertheless, in the space of five years, Dogecoin has grown into its own vibrant community of users. Over time, Dogecoin has become popular as a ���tipping system��� among its users - as stated on the website: One of the most popular uses for Dogecoin is "tipping" fellow internet-goers who create or share great content. Think of it as a more meaningful "like" or upvote, with real value that can be used all across the internet. The cryptocurrency has no limit on the amount of coins that can be created by mining. At the time of writing, there are over 112 bln Dogecoins in circulation. While a single Dogecoin is worth no more than $0.01, a single cent, the total market capitalization is now over $1.19 bln - amounting to 72,423 Bitcoin. Much like Cointelegraph is known for its bold artwork, Dogecoin took up an Internet meme as its ���mascot��� of sorts. The word ���doge��� is a popular internet term for a dog, which started out as a simple misspelling of the word in a TV series back in 2005. As knowyourmeme.com explains, the term doge was married with the picture of a Shiba Inu dog on Reddit back in 2010, leading it to become one of the most well-known internet memes.  Its association with a cryptocurrency came about in 2014 and the rest is history - although Doge and its various memes would have provided constant internet joys with or without a virtual currency. The Dogecoin community is also well known for its charitable endeavors. In 2013, Dogecoin wallet platform Dogewallet was hacked and millions of coins were stolen. In the aftermath, the Dogecoin community started a fundraising effort known as SaveDogemas, which eventually raised the same amount of Dogecoin stolen in the hack just a month after the cyber theft. The community has also raised funds for Olympic athletes, water projects in Kenya as well as retired NASCAR driver Josh Wise. Cypherpunk Jameson Lopp gave the cryptocurrency a shoutout on Twitter: .@ummjackson created @dogecoin as a joke, but at this point the joke's on him. Wow! Such shibes! Very billion! https://t.co/daFL9m3xFw Another user celebrated Dogecoin���s rise in value, pointing out that it was worth more than the Japanese Yen. dogecoin is worth more than the japanese yen now, what a time to be alive pic.twitter.com/bEHpSf3pJo	2
The fear and build up towards Aug. 1, 2017, and the creation of Bitcoin Cash which forked off the original chain was monumental. However, it was a damp squib for the future of Bitcoin as it actually spiked in value. Since then, forks on Bitcoin have become almost as common as ICOs, and in fact, forks on the Bitcoin chain look to be the latest trend for 2018 as new companies look to cash in on the familiar Bitcoin name. Bitcoin Cash is, of course, the most well known Bitcoin fork out there, sitting comfortably in the top five coins in terms of market cap. However, in 2017, there were 19 registered Bitcoin forks. Still, that pales in comparison to the 50 that are expected this year, according to Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research. That number could still rise further as there is even services out there that are providing rudimentary programming skills to launch a clone. This will of course have a big effect in the cryptocurrency market as hedge fund manager Ari Paul predicted in a tweet: 9/ Both BTC and BCH will continue to hard fork and >10% of the value of each (if held today) will reside in new offshoots. There are a number of reasons to fork off the Bitcoin Blockchain, some do it, in the case of Bitcoin Cash, to seemingly improve facets of the old coin, while others may have different motives. As George Kimionis, chief executive officer of Coinomi puts it: ���Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab. Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases rather than honest attempts to contribute to the Blockchain ecosystem.��� Kimionis also sees a new phase in the ICO marketplace with the original hype simmered down somewhat. Forking adds a little edge to a new coin. And Rhett Creighton, who���s working on the upcoming Bitcoin Private fork, predicts: ���Bitcoin forks are kind of the new altcoin. We are going to see now a bunch of Bitcoin forks. And they are going to start replacing some of the top hundred altcoins.��� It is hard to see these minor forks, even the likes of Bitcoin Gold and Diamond which reached the news, really, truly, adding much to the Blockchain environment. Even Bitcoin Cash has been linked to a money making scheme for the likes of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver. The difference between trying to improve the Blockchain, and to make money off a name, is a very blurred line. #CT_questions With as many as 50 #Bitcoin forks slated to take place in 2018, is it likely that some of them will begin displacing other #altcoins from the top-100 by market capitalization??	1
Singer and number one Twitter celebrity Katy Perry has joined the crypto craze by posting an image of her crypto-themed manicure on Instagram Thursday, Jan. 25. Perry���s nails are now decorated with 3D images of five cryptocurrencies superimposed over a background of US dollar bills: the currencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar and Monero. The singer did not disclose the reasons behind her selection. $���CrYpTo ClAwS���$ �������������������� ���� KATY PERRY (@katyperry) ������ 25, 2018 at 12:49 PST The post - captioned ���$���CrYpTo ClAwS���$��� - has managed to amass over 150,000 likes. Perry has also tagged the Instagram accounts of all five cryptocurrencies - ethereum_updates, litecoinofficial, bit, stellarlumens and moneroofficial. More and more celebrities have been exposing their involvement in crypto lately. Earlier this week, rapper 50 Cent was reported to have made about 700 bitcoins when he started accepting Bitcoin for his album released in 2014. He only remembered about his Bitcoin stash, which now amounts to about $7 mln, this week.	2
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade down on July 17 after a further 10% fall sent the price of the largest cryptocurrency back below $10,000.   Market visualization courtesy of Coin360 Data from Coin360 showed a problematic 24 hours for traders Wednesday, BTC/USD circling $9,600 after bouncing off lows at just $9,266. The downward trend followed increased United States government attention on cryptocurrency and related phenomena, with comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the ongoing hearings on Facebook���s Libra closely watched by markets.  Bitcoin 7-day price chart. Courtesy of Coin360 As Bitcoin���s previous parabolic trend appeared firmly over, now, analysts were preparing to brace for a further major correction which could erase even more of its advances. For Peter Brandt, the veteran trader who predicted several of BTC/USD���s previous phases, that correction could amount to 80% of the combined cryptocurrency market cap gains. ���While the parabola in BTC was subject to different renderings, the parabola in the total market cap chart was loud and clear. Total cap should correct 80%. Most of the damage of decline will occur to altcoins,��� he wrote on Twitter Tuesday. ���Market structure is broken and lower-lows have been set on higher time frames,��� investor and regular commentator, Josh Rager, continued.  ���There will be smaller bounces in between, but it looks like the trend has changed folks - for the short term,��� he added, noting the previous bull market pullback lasted up to five weeks before positive sentiment took over. On Wednesday, Brandt���s forecast of more heavy losses for altcoins in particular had yet to come true, with Bitcoin and many major altcoin tokens losing similar amounts in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) fell slightly less than BTC, shedding 10.4% to hit $203, while Litecoin (LTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) mirrored the behavior.   Ether 7-day price chart. Courtesy of Coin360 Some managed to avoid such serious losses, perhaps temporarily, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which declined 6.2% in the same period.  Bitcoin currently accounts for just over 66% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, a near two-year high.	0
Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has laid out the future plan of the Blockchain technology-based platform at a conference in Taipei, dealing with some of the biggest problems in Ethereum and suggesting how the future might shape up. Having already provided a substantial amount of information, the new update from Buterin gives more specific details. The statement from Buterin began with a sort of tongue-in-cheek commentary on the many Ethereum replacements that have come on the market in recent months. According to the young computer scientist: ���The Ethereum killer is Ethereum, the Ethereum of China is Ethereum, the Ethereum of Taiwan is Ethereum��� 2.0.��� Buterin continued by describing the four areas where he sees a need for improvement on the current Ethereum platform. These were privacy, consensus safety, smart contract safety and scalability. For each of the first three, the Ethereum co-founder sees a solution that is actively developing. In the area of privacy, the Byzantium hard fork has created the ability for zk-SNARKs, a solution that Vitalik sees as a viable one with continued implementation. For consensus safety, the recent development, nicknamed ���Casper,��� should bring solutions, and for smart contract safety, Viper and formal verification can produce real solutions.  However, the problem of scaling is substantial. Vitalik explained that decentralization, scalability and security are a complex trifecta that can present major challenges in the future. While it���s relatively easy to have any two of the three creating a system where all three are functional has proven difficult. Scalability on the Ethereum, according to Buterin needs to be thousands of transactions per second, be on-chain only, and be without any supernodes. In other words, it must deal with all three of the issues. The solution, per Vitalik, is found in sharding or allowing side chains were protocol changes can be upgraded while keeping the main chain intact. The change from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake will be a requirement, and Buterin indicated that the timeline is likely three to five years, though he sees a substantial amount of change happening in the near term, as these upgrades begin to take shape.	1
Malaysia is the latest regulatory theater to come after Binance as authorities in the country have accused the exchange giant of continuing to operate in the country illegally. According to an announcement released on Friday, the Securities Commission (SC) Malaysia has served a public reprimand against Binance, calling for the exchange and all of its entities to cease operations in the country. The SC stated that Binance continued to operate in Malaysia despite previous warnings. Indeed, back in July 2020, Cointelegraph reported that Binance was not permitted to operate in Malaysia. At the time, the SC published an "Investor Alert List" containing several digital asset exchanges offering services in the country without due authorization from Malaysian regulators. Binance has 14 business days from Tuesday to comply with the order that includes disabling its website and mobile apps, as well as discontinuing any media campaign for its services in the country.  The announcement also mandated that Binance's CEO, Changpeng Zhao, ensures full compliance with the order. Malaysia's securities regulator also urged citizens to desist from trading with crypto exchanges operating in the country illegally.  Responding to Cointelegraph's request for comments, a spokesperson for the exchange explained that Binance.com does not operate out of Malaysia, adding:  The news out of Malaysia concerning Binance is only the latest in sweeping regulatory actions specifically targeted at the exchange giant. From warnings to investigations and now outright bans, the platforms appear to be under the cosh of financial watchdogs across the globe. Earlier in July, Italy's financial regulator issued a warning against Binance, stating that the platform was not authorized to offer services in the country. Apart from Italy, countries like Germany, Poland, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom, among others, have also issued warnings about Binance. Binance, for its part, has taken steps to mitigate the situation, with its CEO promising to work with regulators amid plans for even further expansion across the globe. There has also been a flurry of policy changes at the exchange with withdrawal limits reduced for users who are yet to complete the platform's identity verification protocols. Meanwhile, the exchange has also announced plans to shut down crypto derivatives trading in Europe, beginning with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.	0
Australia has officially confirmed it will treat Bitcoin ���just like money��� from this year and it will no longer be subject to double taxation. In its budget summary for 2017-18, the government states that as part of its plan to ���make it easier��� for digital currency businesses to operate in the country. It will ensure that nowhere in the supply chain is general sales tax (GST) paid more than once. ���The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia,��� the summary reads. ���From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes. Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.��� Australia has had a troubled relationship with cryptocurrency regulation until recently. The decision to allow double taxation originally caused several well-known operators to quit the country back in 2014, while innovation has subsequently lagged behind markets in which businesses have enjoyed greater freedom. Innovative fintech deals involving Blockchain have surfaced this year, however, and the tone of the budget extract points to a desire to change Australia���s environment. ���Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia,��� it continues. ���The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (FinTech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.��� Meanwhile, local business optimism is also increasing.	2
Customers at J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup cannot buy cryptocurrencies with credit cards, CNBC reported today, Feb.3. J.P. Morgan Chase had confirmed to CNBC on Jan. 25 that they were allowing credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies, and Bank of America and Citigroup had said they were reviewing their policies on credit card purchases of crypto. However, J.P. Morgan Chase���s policy has seen a quick reversal, as a spokesperson from the bank told CNBC today: "At this time, we are not processing cryptocurrency purchases using credit cards, due to the volatility and risk involved. We will review the issue as the market evolves." Citigroup also stated today that they were ���no longer permit[ing] credit card purchases of cryptocurrency,��� and would review their policy as the crypto market develops, while Bank of America is also declining credit card purchases of digital currencies, pending policy reviews. The recent FUD in the media this week caused Bitcoin (BTC) to drop below $8000 for the first time since November 2017, perhaps scaring the big banks into reviewing their credit card policies. Last week, when J.P. Morgan Chase was still allowing credit card crypto purchases, Bitcoin���s high in trading was around $11,700, according to CoinMarketCap. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who had previously called Bitcoin a ���fraud��� and threatened to fire any employee that invested in the cryptocurrency, told a Cointelegraph reporter at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Jan. 24 that he���s ���not a skeptic��� in regards to his previous crypto criticism. BTC is now trading around $9,180, up 4.45 percent over a 24-hour period by press time.	0
Crypto markets have taken a vertiginous plunge today, August 4, with Bitcoin (BTC) losing almost $500 in the six hours before press time to dip below $7,000, and all of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap in the red, as data from Coin360 shows.  Market visualization from Coin360 Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $7,028 to press time, having lost almost $500 on the day to plummet to a price point not seen since July 17. The leading cryptocurrency has seen an intra-day low of $6980, with some crypto analysts today noting that $6,800 has become its short-term critical support level. Bitcoin���s price percentage loss on the day is near 7 percent, with a weekly loss of about 15 percent and monthly gains squeezed to just 5 percent.  Bitcoin���s 7-day price chart. Source: Cointelegraph Bitcoin Price Index Ethereum (ETH) has seen a markedly less pronounced drop on its daily chart, losing just over 2 percent over a 24-hour period to press time to trade around $404. The altcoin���s fortunes have been shaky much of the week, having seen jagged losses since July 29, when the asset was still trading as high as $470. On the week, Ethereum is down over 13 percent, with monthly losses at nearly 15 percent.  Ethereum���s 7-day price chart. Source: Cointelegraph Ethereum Price Index On CoinMarketCap���s listings, none of the top ten cryptocurrencies are in the green to press time. Taking an even heftier hit than Bitcoin, Stellar (XLM) and IOTA (MIOTA) have seen losses of as high as around 9 and 10 percent respectively on the day. To press time, Stellar is trading around $0.24 and IOTA around $0.84. Among the top twenty coins by market cap, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is the major outlier, up almost 9 percent over the 24-hour period to trade at about $16 to press time. The altcoin���s solid gains kicked off late August 3, probably due to news of the asset���s imminent listing on major U.S. crypto exchange and wallet service provider Coinbase as of August 7. Since its spike, the coin has traded sideways most of today, seemingly immunized from the major losses in the wider crypto markets.  Ethereum Classic���s 24-hour price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has plunged down to around $253 billion ������ over $13 billion lost in the six hours before press time, and a staggering $50 billion lower than their July 26 surge to $303.7 billion.  1-day chart of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap The markets��� nosedive today is in stark contrast to yesterday���s major news that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) ������ the operator of 23 leading global exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ������ plans to create a global ecosystem for digital assets that would cover the spectrum from federally regulated markets and warehousing to merchant and consumer needs. ICE moreover plans to launch physically-delivered BTC futures contracts this November, distinct from those currently offered on CME and CBOE that are ultimately settled in fiat. The likes of Starbucks and Microsoft are on board for the new venture, dubbed ���Bakkt,��� which will begin by offering Bitcoin-fiat conversion for consumers to purchase everyday goods with crypto. ICE���s unveiling of Bakkt prompted CNBC���s Brian Kelly today to suggest that this is ���the biggest Bitcoin news of the year,��� advocating that now is a good ���point of entry��� for investors ahead of crypto���s impending institutionalization.	0
By now, many Bitcoin enthusiasts are trying to work out a realistic projection for Bitcoin over the next few years. From analyst Ronnie Moas who sees a $15,000-$20,000 value by late 2020 to independent views that point at $1 mln per Bitcoin, some of these predictions seem outrageous and outright impossible. Following the activation of the SegWit protocol and early testing of the Lightning Network that SegWit enables, the Bitcoin market has been gradually edging to a capitalization of almost $80 billion. Bitcoin���s market capitalization is now about 50% of the entire crypto market and has now exceeded 1% of gold���s estimated $7 tln market cap. Bitcoin is nearly half of Visa���s $200 bln cap. Bitcoin���s daily transaction numbers have been growing steadily. According to Coinmarketcap, Bitcoin���s daily trading volume is about 400,000 BTC per day while only 1728 new Bitcoins are created through mining each day. By the next halving in 2020, the number of Bitcoins mined each day will drop to 864. By the subsequent halving in 2024, there will only be 432 new Bitcoins produced each day. Some time around 2032, nearly 99% of all bitcoin to ever exist (20,671,875) will have been mined. After that, people will spend the next 100 years trying to get their hands on the remaining 1.6%. At some point, people are likely to realize that nearly all the Bitcoins ever to exist have already been mined, and there aren���t nearly enough Bitcoins to go around. When this happens, there will likely be major ���fear of missing out��� and prices should climb accordingly. If the price continues to rise as it has this year (going by the $689.80 Bitcoin price as of early July last year), Bitcoin will reach about $20,000 by the next block reward halving in 2020.	2
Holding a net worth of about $140 billion, Jeff Bezos could theoretically afford to buy all the Bitcoin (BTC) in circulation. What would happen if he tried? Genesis Mining's head of mining operations, Philip Salter, weighed in on the matter. "Of course he could only buy the liquid BTC on exchanges, massively driving up prices in the process," Salter told Cointelegraph in an email.  Bitcoin has a current circulating supply of 18,339,687, but over the years, industry participants estimate at least some of this supply has been lost by early adopters and miners who no longer are able to access their original stashes. Additionally, the BTC which is currently for sale on exchanges, also called liquid Bitcoin, is only a small fraction of the coins in circulation. "It's hard to say how many coins are up for sale right now and at what price level investors would stop hodling to sell their coins," Salter said.    "I don't think he could to buy a large percentage of all BTC this way, because when the price starts going up, people will stop selling their coins, assuming there is a new spike approaching and wanting to profit from that," he added.  If Bezos flooded the BTC markets with buy orders, all the liquidity would rapidly disappear, with surging prices blocking out further buying, Salter explained.  "Salter mentioned other alternative purchase methods, such as over-the-counter, or OTC buying, as well as picking up stacks of the coin from miners. "Maybe he could pull off a large purchase without increasing the price immediately by making several deals like this at the same time," he said.   Salter did make sure to note that his comments are speculative, however, as he is not currently on top of exchange liquidity levels, or those holding stockpiles of BTC.  At a press time price near $7,115, Bitcoin's entire market cap sits at $130,483,137,741. At his current net worth, Bezos could theoretically afford all BTC, and still have about $10 billion to spare.	1
What highs (or lows) could Bitcoin reach by the end of the year? Watch Cointelegraph���s latest video to find out! The moderates The Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model created by PlanB is one of the most well-known price prediction apparatuses in the Bitcoin space. It forecasts the long-term price trend of Bitcoin by weighing two main factors: the amount of BTC in existence (the stock) versus the amount of newly mined coins entering the market (the flow).  Thus far, the model has been eerily accurate. Bitcoin closed February 26% above the model���s projected price and remains on pace to hit the model���s end-of-year target of $288K. With Bitcoin currently trading at around $56K, it would need to increase over 400% between now and December. Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital and Dan Morehead of Pantera Capital haven���t set their sights on $200K for 2021, but that doesn���t mean they are bearish. They both believe Bitcoin will close the year above $100K, which would be double the current price. In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Pomp noted: The naysayers Wherever there are bulls, there are also bears. Peter Schiff is one of the most outspoken Bitcoin critics in the crypto space. He believes Bitcoin is a pumped-up bubble that will eventually lead most investors to financial ruin. According to him, it���s only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down to zero. In an interview, Schiff said: Eyes on the prize Who would have thought the day would come when $100K, or even $200K, Bitcoin price predictions are considered moderate? Well, today may finally be that day. Unconfirmed reports say Citibank have set their sights set on even higher price targets for 2021.  And that's just in the short term. As Bitcoin's price rises, so do the long-term forecasts. Frank Holmes of US Global Investors and Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Investments both believe half a million dollars is within reach in the coming years. But there's one price prediction that trumps them all. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor foresees Bitcoin sucking up 'monetary energy', which would propel it to an unthinkable price: Watch the video above for our analysis of Bitcoin's short-term and long-term price targets.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has reached an adoption milestone by surpassing the 1-million-holders mark ��� even though the memecoin is trading 50% below its all-time high.  News of the milestone and daily price increases has energized the Shiba Inu community since the official Shiba Inu Twitter account tweeted a shoutout late on Thursday. Such a proud, and amazing milestone for the #ShibArmy!$SHIB reaches 1,000,000 holders.Today we all cheer, and celebrate this great moment in SHIB's history.#1MFRIENDSHIBS #SHIB pic.twitter.com/T1UtMRdQ7r Since the project reached this milestone, the price has jumped up 11.4% over the past 24 hours, with SHIB now trading at $0.00004237 according to CoinGecko. There are 1,002,021 SHIB holders, according to data from Etherscan.  Despite the recent price increase, SHIB is still trading well below its Oct. 28 peak of $0.00008190, possibly due to SHIB whales taking profits.  There���s plenty going on in the Shiba Inu world. Bitfinex Derivatives listed SHIB with Tether (USDT)-paired perpetual contracts for trading on Tuesday.  And South Korean exchange Korbit has been accepting deposits, and SHIB was scheduled to start trading at 3 am UTC. This makes Korbit the first Korean exchange to list Shiba Inu.  Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently the only other memecoin available to trade on the big four exchanges that still operate legally in South Korea ��� Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit. Korbit has the opportunity to list new tokens paired with the Korean won, as it was one of the few exchanges in Korea to have come into full compliance by Sept. 24 with new rules designed to combat money laundering. DOGE is South Korea���s fifth-most traded crypto by trade volume. DOGE has been very popular in Korea since 2017 when the country was gripped by initial coin offering fever and cryptocurrencies traded at a premium compared to global prices ��� known as the ���Kim Chi Premium.��� It remains to be seen whether the addition of more memecoins such as Shiba Inu could lead to another speculative frenzy. SHIB is one of the most popular memecoins on the market today, behind only DOGE. Both are among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Inspired by DOGE, SHIB itself has many copycat coins across several chains. In total, there are over 19 cryptos with ���Shiba��� in their names.	2
Due to the recent hype of Bitcoin earlier this week, Litecoin (LTC) has reacted with a massive run of its own. The cryptocurrency is now approaching a 100 percent price increase just 24 hours after Bitcoin cooled down. The price of Litecoin is quickly heading for $200 USD, marking LTC as the sixth largest market capitalization at almost $9 bln. LTC volume on @GDAX over 3M, which is more than $400MM worth of litecoins traded. This means Litecoin has made Coinbase more than $1MM in revenue today from GDAX alone! pic.twitter.com/TgPpWWNbxn Recently, there was some concern that a ���flippening��� would take place, with Bitcoin Cash threatening to overtake Bitcoin���s place as the leading cryptocurrency. However, if present trends continue, a different type of flippening may occur with Litecoin���s market cap potentially eclipsing that of BCH. Litecoin has historically played a fundamental role as a tester for Bitcoin, implementing potential BTC additions in a smaller, more controlled environment to see how successful they may or may not be. Litecoin���s creator, Charlie Lee, has maintained a supportive attitude toward Bitcoin, and it���s logical to suggest that Litecoin will not stray from its role anytime in the near future. Bitcoin is making a HUGE statement today showing all the altcoins who the king of crypto is! Wow.   $16500 now. I'm expecting a correction anytime now. But then again, I have been expecting a correction since $5000. What do I know? ? pic.twitter.com/ibEp2AocFJ	1
One of the three major questions that the President of the European Central Bank will be answering via a series of videos on Feb. 12, 2018 is about cryptocurrencies and Blockchain. Mario Draghi will respond to the selected questions, whether Bitcoin offers a viable alternative to traditional currencies as well as comment on the ECB's view on its technology, provided they are submitted by Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2018. Europeans aged between 16 and 35 can also ask questions around three main topics: possibility of a new global economic crisis, cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, Europe���s economic recovery and youth unemployment The session is part of the ECB���s third Youth Dialogue which usually constitutes a series of talks held by the Bank���s policymakers with students and young people from different countries and backgrounds. As a prelude to the session, the ECB has launched a Twitter opinion poll to ask if Bitcoin could offer a viable alternative to traditional currencies. The poll by Europe���s top bank has received more than 15,500 responses in about 24 hours. While the role of central banks in the digital currency world has always been a subject of debate, the view that they exist to help ensure stability for economies still stands. Bitcoin���s volatility has earned criticism of being a vehicle for perpetrating fraud from the likes of Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of the US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Luxembourg's Finance Minister, Pierre Gramegna also suggested that the European Union could soon introduce new cryptocurrency regulations. What is clear is that 2017 was a crucial year for Bitcoin. Top digital currency soared in popularity globally as its value rose sharply, while crypto gained mainstream media���s attention. Though there is no evidence, such awareness increased its adoption in Europe, available statistical data about 2017 shows that its use as an every-day payment method in main European economies is still minimal. Nevertheless, it is obvious that new information has been dropped into the public domain for many people to sort on their own. It should make the ECB���s Q&A session to be an interesting watch even if nothing new is expected. The session is coming in the wake of the recent suspension of Bitcoin-backed Visa debit cards in Europe and proposed introduction of EU-wide regulation on such currencies. It���s also worth thinking what the outcome could mean for the affected payment processors who are reportedly in talks with alternate card issuers in Europe and for those seeking to set up a crypto/fiat bank that would be independent of traditional banks.	1
In 2017, several Ethereum-based decentralized application (dapp) browsers gained significant popularity, primarily due to the rise of dapps like CryptoKitties. During its peak, CryptoKitties, the digital cartoon collectibles game, was responsible for more than 20 percent of the entire Ethereum network���s daily transaction volume. CryptoKitties in particular was praised by some of the cryptocurrency sector���s experts like Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan. Srinivasan noted that CryptoKitties has demonstrated the potential of the Ethereum network to process digital asset trading in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of intermediaries. According to Srinivasan: ���It's one of the first examples of what people have been talking about for years: frictionless international trading of digital assets (not just cash) on a Blockchain.��� But CryptoKitties was a one-time success story of a decentralized application that reached large-scale commercial success. It did so through extensive mainstream media coverage triggered by a sudden increase in demand. It is extremely rare for an app on the Ethereum protocol to achieve the level of success that CryptoKitties did. To imagine the current structure of Ethereum���s decentralized application market, one has to consider the mobile app era prior to the existence of Google Play Store and Apple App Store. At that time, users had to download apps from websites directly from the distributors and developers. The process was highly inefficient and for apps to gain popularity, a significant amount of capital had to be allocated to marketing. Over the past few months, Ethereum-based browsers have provided a better platform for users to search for innovative decentralized applications. These browsers are essentially operating similarly to the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store in terms of aggregating decentralized apps for users to peruse. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong explained in a blog post that in the future, Ethereum-based browsers could increase the accessibility of decentralized applications and potentially introduce them to a larger user and consumer base. Armstrong wrote: ���Our theory is that the smartphone + Ethereum + dapps offer an unprecedented opportunity to bring this to people all over the world. We���re attempting to increase the economic freedom of the world, and clean up some bad behavior in the lowest scoring countries. It can be easy to take the above tools for granted if you���ve only ever lived in developed countries. But for the majority of people living in the world today, those tools are inaccessible.��� Decentralized applications launched on top of the Ethereum protocol utilize the ERC20 token standard and operate with native tokens compatible with Ether. Consequently, the trading of digital tokens can be processed seamlessly on decentralized trading platforms. Still, experts like Armstrong believe that the adoption of Ethereum browsers and decentralized applications could take many months to achieve commercial success. Once they do, however, they are poised to revolutionize the dapps market.	2
Government officials from the US and UK have said they are ���looking at��� cryptocurrency this week as the topic gains considerable focus at the ongoing World Economic Forum 2018. Speaking separately at the annual event, US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and UK prime minister Theresa May both said that ���illicit��� or ���criminal��� use of Bitcoin was cause for ensuring appropriate regulation. ���My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities,��� Mnuchin told CNBC. ���So in the U.S., our regulations (state that) if you're a bitcoin wallet you're subject to the same regulations as a bank.��� Theresa May meanwhile echoed the need to ensure Bitcoin had only bonafide uses in the UK as it prepares to leave the European Union with only limited regulation in place surrounding cryptocurrency. ���In areas like cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously, precisely because of the way they can be used, particularly by criminals,��� May said in an interview with Bloomberg. ���It is something that has been developing��� I think it���s something that we do need to look at.��� As Cointelegraph reveals insights into cryptocurrency from the world���s leaders at Davos, in the US, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton co-authored an article in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Jan. 24. Clayton���s piece is dedicated to so-called ���distributed ledger technology��� and how its regulatory future should look. Echoing May and Mnuchin, SEC chairman has reiterated the need for strict oversight of the ���offer, sale and trading��� of cryptocurrencies: ���The SEC will vigorously pursue those [cryptocurrencies] who seek to evade the registration, disclosure and antifraud requirements of our securities laws,��� he wrote in the WSJ. ���If history is any guide, DLT is likely to be followed by many more life-changing innovations. But we will not allow it or any other advancement to disrupt our commitment to fair and sound markets.���	0
Electrical supply company Crescent Electric (CESCO) study reveals that the state of Louisiana is the cheapest state in the US to mine Bitcoin. Digital currency mining requires a lot of electric power and the power rates differ in every state. Based on CESCO���s latest study of the cost of cryptocurrency mining across the US, it is currently cheapest to mine Bitcoin in Louisiana -- electricity costs at 9.87 cents per watt puts the average cost of mining one Bitcoin at $3,224. This is significantly cheaper than the current price of Bitcoin, which is currently trading at around $12,000 per coin, as of press time.  In their study, CESCO also estimated the cost of Bitcoin mining based on the wattage consumption of the three most popular mining rigs, namely, the AntMiner S9, the AntMiner S7, and the Avalon 6, as well as the average days each rig takes to mine a token. These figures were then multiplied by the average electricity rate in each state. Aside from Louisiana, the other top five states with the lowest cost to mine Bitcoin are Idaho ($3,289 per token), Washington ($3,309), Tennessee ($3,443) and Arkansas ($3,505). The study also names the most expensive states for digital currency mining. The list of costliest states is led by Hawaii, which takes an average mining cost of $9,483 per coin. Rounding up the top five states with the highest Bitcoin mining rates are Alaska ($7,059), Connecticut ($6,951), Massachusetts ($6,674) and New Hampshire ($6,425). The growing interest in cryptocurrency has been accompanied by growing concern over the energy required to mine crypto, namely Bitcoin. Such claims have been recently countered, as a report came out claiming that put cryptocurrency mining in the larger context of energy consumption.	1
Bank Indonesia issued a press release on Jan. 13, warning its citizens against the use of selling, buying or trading cryptocurrency and reiterating that virtual currency is not legitimate within Indonesia. This statement comes after the September reassertion that Bank Indonesia will not accept Bitcoin (BTC) as payment, leading to the voluntary closure of two Indonesian-based crypto exchanges, BitBayar and TokoBitcoin. Bank Indonesia cites concerns over potential use in money laundering and funding terrorism as reasons behind their anti-cryptocurrency campaign: ���Virtual currencies are vulnerable to bubble risks and susceptible to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing, therefore can potentially impact financial system stability and cause financial harm to society.��� While there is no official ban on Bitcoin within the country, per Wikipedia, the press release forbidding all activity relating to cryptocurrency takes a harsher tone than previous statements that merely advised citizens to be careful around Bitcoin. Algeria���s government has also taken steps towards a crypto ban, with reports that the 2018 Finance Bill will make Bitcoin ownership and trading illegal within the country. In early January, Egypt���s top Religious Official, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam, declared Bitcoin unlawful according to Sharia law citing concerns about money laundering and terrorism funding as well.	0
Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has touted the revolutionary impact of cryptocurrencies ��� while seemingly poking fun at the concept in the same breath. In a video that was uploaded by Kevin Svenson, Musk can be heard saying, ���there is a good chance that crypto is the future currency of Earth.��� How ironic would it be if Dogecoin (DOGE), the coin invented as a joke, wins out in the end, Musk pondered.  Elon Musk talks about $DOGE Coin(Released 4 Hours Ago)@elonmusk said "There is a good chance that #Crypto is the future currency of Earth ... but which one is it going to be?" #Doge #DogeCoin #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency #cryptocurrencies #DOge pic.twitter.com/HDaf5jw3Xx ���What would be the most ironic outcome? That the currency that was invented as a joke in fact becomes a real currency,��� he said. DOGE has been at the center of a massive pump-and-dump spurred on by Reddit traders and investors who have become highly receptive to Musk���s tweets. The latter camp isn���t small, either.  A recent report from Blockchain Research Lab titled, How Elon Musk���s Twitter activity moves cryptocurrency markets, showed the billionaire has a positive influence on digital asset values and trading whenever he tweets about them.  The report said: Musk���s ability to move the markets through Twitter has left some investors worried given the enigmatic CEO���s turbulent history with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  As CNBC reports, Musk���s tweets were behind the recent 12% surge in CD Projekt, which created the role-playing video game Cyberpunk 2077. Although Musk���s tweet had substance ��� namely, that Tesla���s Model S Plaid car would allow passengers to play the game ��� his apparent shilling of the GameStop short squeeze could have negative consequences for retail traders who get caught up in the hype.  After breaking above $500 in late January, GameStop's share price has plunged all the way back to the sub-$70 level.  Musk has run afoul of the SEC in the past after tweeting his desire to take Tesla private at $420 per share. He and Tesla each had to pay the securities regulator a $20 million fine to settle fraud charges related to the tweet. The settlements had serious ramifications for the electric vehicle maker's corporate structure: ���I do not respect the SEC,��� Musk said after he paid the fine.  Despite the regulatory backlash, Musk told 60 Minutes in a Dec 2018 interview that his tweets will not be censored. He explained:	1
BitMEX Research has identified a suspected double-spend transaction valued at 0.00062063 BTC or roughly $21 ��� and it doesn���t appear to be an instance of that popular replace-by-fee wallet hack.  On Jan. 20, BitMEX���s ForkMonitor noted that ���multiple blocks were produced at height 666833.��� BitMEX Research tweeted: [1/2] There was a stale Bitcoin block today, at height 666,833. SlushPool has beaten F2Pool in a race.It appears as if a small double spend of around 0.00062063 BTC ($21) was detectedhttps://t.co/o8lz9xagYG pic.twitter.com/IEdPu8JEjt One hour later, BitMEX Research attributed the orphaned block to an RBF transaction, which is where an unconfirmed transaction is replaced with a new transfer paying a higher fee. However, ForkMonitor has since updated its advice to say: ���No (RBF) bumps have been detected.��� Twitter-user and BSV���s Australian advocate Eli Afram noted the ���mixed messages��� from BitMEX Research, asserting the double-spent transaction should be cause for concern despite its small value: Satoshi Nakamoto���s Bitcoin Whitepaper is credited with having solved the double-spend problem in 2009. The challenge of ensuring that a decentralized network can autonomously verify that the same coins have not been transferred more than once had stymied earlier attempts at digital cash.  In July, crypto security firm ZenGo identified a double-spend exploit targeting several popular Bitcoin wallets. While the wallet manufacturers moved to address the exploit, Bitcoin Cash proponent Hayden Otto warned the vulnerability may be inherent to BTC���s replace-by-fee functionality. He���d earlier exploited the same vulnerability in a viral video. Update: The headline to this article has been updated to note that BitMEX Research suspected a double spend. Subsequent analysis has determined that their suspicions were incorrect.	1
Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of altcoin Cardano (ADA), tweeted June 20 that the entry of Wall Street into the crypto sector will bring in ���tens of trillions of dollars:��� What's often missed by the cryptocurrency is going to die broken record media is that after the next wave of regulation, wall street is showing up to the party with all their locked up capital. That's tens of trillions of dollars entering the space eventually. Future is bright Cardano, which is currently ranked 8th on Coinmarketcap, has a market cap of around $3.5 billion. Charles Hoskinson was also one of the founding members of Ethereum (ETH), crypto startup Invictus Innovations, and crypto tech company IOHK. When asked by a commentator what exactly the crypto community is building, Hoskinson answered ���an entirely new world:��� An entirely new world The intersection of cryptocurrency and Wall Street has been welcomed by those who also see a potential influx in capital. In mid-May, cryptocurrency wallet and exchange Coinbase released a new suite of products designed to attract institutional investors by relieving security and regulatory compliance concerns. Speaking about the product release, the VP of Coinbase referred to ���$10 billion��� of Wall Street money that now had the potential to enter the market. The ���trillion��� value has also been bandied around before, as Dan Morehead, CEO of $1 billion crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in April that a $40 trillion crypto market is possible, in part due to Wall Street���s increasing interest in clearing crypto trades.	2
Brisbane Airport (BNE) will soon become the first cryptocurrency airport terminal, according to reports from local media. The airport is working with local and international companies to make the entire terminal cryptocurrency friendly, with stores, coffee shops and restaurants accepting Bitcoin, Ether and Dash. The move to digital currencies makes sense for the airport, as the number of crypto investors increases. According to Roel Hellemons, the General Manager of Strategic Planning and Development: ���Many people around the world have made money investing in cryptocurrencies and a lot of these people travel internationally, so it makes sense to offer a digital currency experience within our terminals.��� The airport will partner with TravelbyBit, a cryptocurrency payment system, in order to allow travelers the ability to buy digitally. The move highlights Australia���s growing warmth toward cryptocurrencies and digital payment methods, in spite of negative perspectives from other countries. With the recent ban from China and the threats from South Korea, the openness of Australian policy will come as a welcome change for crypto investors.	2
Bitcoin���s anonymous yet transparent nature makes for some interesting reading when trawling through the easily accessible information on the top wallets out there. While these top 10 wallets, do not have names attached to them, some are easy to figure out. The Winklevoss twins made history in early December by becoming the first widely accepted Bitcoin Billionaires. It was estimated at the time of print that the twins held 91,666 which equated to $1.063 bln. However, these high profile twins are one of the few that are solidly in the spotlight that it is easy to speculate on their wealth. It is believed that there could be far more Bitcoin Billionaires out there, lurking in the shadow. If it was the norm to hold all our funds in one wallet, it would be easy to put together a rich list and speculate who belongs where. However, not only does Bitcoin���s anonymity but its practices of good coin storage, also make things difficult. The normal procedure, especially for those whose funds are closer to billions than hundreds like most mere mortals, is to split the wealth over a number of wallets and other storage methods. It is a lesson that everyone should heed when it comes to keeping one���s fortune on the wild west that is Bitcoin exchanges. A representative for BitInfoCharts, who wished to remain anonymous because of security concerns, told MSN in an email that, given Bitcoin���s current overall market capitalization and that most people hold Bitcoin at multiple addresses, there may actually be as many as 200 Bitcoin billionaires, and possibly no fewer than 35. The rep noted that it���s likely most of these addresses are owned by exchanges or hedge funds. A billionaire could keep on being created without much work needing to be done by some of the more than 100 addresses that already have over $100 mln in Bitcoin currently. The growth of Bitcoin has turned many people into millionaires and is doing the same with those people taking the step up to billionaires. If there are so many of these billionaires out there making a massive profit from some savvy early investing or clever trading perhaps, why are they so hidden and secretive? The king of secrecy and anonymity is, of course, Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto who has been estimated to be sitting on one mln Bitcoins. Much has been made over Nakamoto's reasoning for remaining hidden and seemingly out of all Bitcoin activity, but there is also speculation mounting over his fortune which could be rivaling some of the richest men in the world. Of course, one of the biggest reason for remaining hidden when you are sitting on enough money to buy an island is the tax and regulatory implications that could come into play if you were to suddenly show your face. Regulators are playing a game of treat the symptom, not the disease when it comes to Bitcoin as they struggle to keep up. This has seen tax agencies still scratching their heads, leaving massive loopholes for Bitcoiners. However, those with massive fortunes who are publicly known would most likely be the first in the firing line.	1
The investment guru who said Bitcoin was in a bubble as early as 2017 recently speculated that all cryptocurrencies will be gone eventually.  In an interview with the Asahi publication AERA dot on Friday, investor Jim Rogers said cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) ���will be in decline eventually and everything will go to zero."  "Those who use cryptocurrency think they are smarter than their governments,��� Rogers said to AERA dot. ���In fact, I think they are correct. But their governments have something that crypto people don't have. That is guns. The reason why I think cryptocurrency will be gone eventually is that it is not based on the armed force of governments' power."  There has been some unproven correlation between the rising and falling prices of cryptocurrencies and governments acting more authoritarian. When United States President Donald Trump ordered the forced dispersal of peaceful protesters near the White House grounds on June 1, the price of Bitcoin surged more than 8%. Cointelegraph reported in November 2017 that Rogers said BTC ���looks and smells��� like a bubble. This was prior to the cryptocurrency reaching its all-time high price of over $20,000 in December 2017. ���Cryptocurrencies didn't even exist a few years ago, but in the blink of an eye they became 100 and 1000 times more valuable. This is a clear bubble and I don't know the right price. Virtual currency is not an investment target. It's just gambling.��� Along with billionaires such as Warren Buffett and George Soros, Rogers is considered one of the largest investors in the world. His views in the AERA dot interview echo those of Buffett, who said ���cryptocurrencies basically have no value��� in February.	0
During an interview with state-owned national television network CCTV-13, Hu Bing, a researcher at the Institute of Finance and Banking, a Chinese government-supported academic research organization, claimed that the government���s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) is only temporary. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and its Institute of Finance and Banking are affiliated with the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the chief administrative authority of the People���s Republic of China. The Chinese Institute of Finance and its researchers are considered to be a government institution and government officials. In his interview with CCTV translated by Box Mining, Bing explained that the suspension on ICOs and the government���s declaration of ICOs as an illegal fundraising method are only temporary, until local financial regulators introduce necessary regulatory frameworks and policies for both ICO investors and projects. More importantly, Bing emphasized that the Chinese cryptocurrency community must understand that the government has not ���forbidden��� ICOs but instead ���paused��� them, demonstrating the government���s intention to resume ICOs in the near future. Bing also noted that the Chinese government and its financial regulators are currently considering the potential of allowing ICOs to raise money in a controlled environment, through a licensing program. Essentially, if the government decides to legalize and regulate the ICO market, its licensing program would structure similarly to the BitLicense program of New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDF), which requires companies to obtain a license from the state in order to operate and serve people of New York. Many startups in New York have left the state due to the impractical policies proposed by NYSDF and the BitLicense. Specifically, even large-scale startups like ShapeShift, which remain as one of the most widely utilized cryptocurrency exchanges, have left New York because of the state���s strict policies in regard to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. But, five companies including Coinbase and Bitstamp have maintained their operations in the state of New York, spending upwards to $100,000 in order to obtain their license. In the upcoming months, it���s possible for the Chinese government to roll out a licensing program for ICOs, as an attempt to restructure the market and introduce legitimate ICO projects and Blockchain startups to the public for token sales and fundraising. It is important to consider that the Chinese government has a history of banning many emerging and innovative technologies. For instance, in 2013, the Chinese government and its financial regulators had banned Bitcoin on two separate occasions. PBoC went as far to ban Bitcoin transactions and trading activities. But, as trading activities simply moved over to over-the-counter markets and the market became even more difficult to regulate, PBoC and Chinese financial regulators came to a consensus to legalize and regulate Bitcoin. A similar situation may transpire with the ICO market. If ICOs and Blockchain startups simply move to Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, countries that have expressed their optimism towards ICOs, the ban on ICOs by the Chinese government will only hurt the Chinese Blockchain sector.	2
It���s high time for Bitcoin (BTC) to begin its next significant price rise, the creator of one of the best-known BTC price models says. In a tweet on Sep. 14, quantitative analyst PlanB highlighted increasing signs that BTC/USD is due to repeat historical gains. Referring to the original incarnation of his stock-to-flow (S2F) model, PlanB said that the time was right to begin an order of magnitude step up. ���This is the 2019 time series model on historical BTC data only (no gold, silver, diamonds, real estate data used),��� he wrote alongside a new chart. ���You see the jump in model value at the halving (white line) and corresponding drop in S2F multiple / model error (white dots). Time to go up.���  Bitcoin stock-to-flow model as of Sep. 14. Source: PlanB/ Twitter The original S2F chart differs from the more recent stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX) model, which incorporates macro factors and introduces ���phases��� in Bitcoin���s metamorphosis as an asset. It calls for an average BTC price of $288,000 before 2024. Since the May halving, Bitcoin has put in ���red dots��� on the model, which have run to expectations, if not in a similar fashion to what happened after the 2016 halving. Interestingly, Cointelegraph market analyst Michael van de Poppe is also seeing the same pattern emerge from a technical analysis perspective. ���If you���d like to compare periods and market cycles, the current state of the market is comparable to 2016,��� he tweeted on Sept. 14. ���Slow upwards grind, with long sideways consolidation periods. In 2016, several were seen. In 2020, 2021, it's likely we���ll see that too.��� When asked where the source of funds will come from in order to propel BTC/USD toward $100,000, PlanB highlighted a blog post about S2F and confirmed that his hypothesis remained valid. It would be ���silver, gold, countries with negative interest rates [..], countries with predatory governments [..], billionaires and millionaires hedging against quantitative easing (QE), and institutional investors.��� Optimism on safe havens continues this week beyond Bitcoin. As Cointelegraph reported, hopes are high that gold will react positively to Wednesday���s policy update from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Continuing, Mike McGlone, chief strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlighted strength in gold. ���Rising gold prices, despite declining managed-money net-longs hedge funds and an advancing dollar, are a sign of the strengthening foundation under the metal,��� he summarized on Monday. ���Less speculation vs. more organic demand forces are at play for the store of value, which indicates a healthy bull market.��� XAU/USD currently lingers at just under $1,950, having hit all-time highs of $2,075 in August.	1
Matthew Lesko, the US author who made himself a name in the 90s writing books on how to get ���free money��� from the United States government, claimed that cryptocurrencies are a scam and Bitcoin is a ���gamble,��� talking to CNET in an interview on Feb. 20. Lesko, who runs his own website, YouTube channel and various podcasts, all dedicated to the topic of obtaining federal grants from the US government, says that ���many people are interested��� in Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Lesko recommended these people to ���stay away��� from digital currencies unless they ���have money to lose.��� The ���free money guy��� elaborated: ���You're playing with sharks right now. This is the beginning of something, [and] no one knows where it's going.��� Lesko argues that cryptocurrencies are actually a ���scam���, since they are not backed by anything and are not regulated, unlike the US dollar. He believes that ���if there's no regulation, you get screwed.��� In 2004 the New York State Consumer Protection Board criticized Lesko's commercials and books, stating that many of his readers did not get the "free money" he promised. According to Lesko himself, Blockchain experts today implement the same ���exaggerations��� he used in his 90s ���free-money��� infomercials.	0
A student has claimed to have found private keys accidentally HODLed starting as early as 2011 which will unlock more than $4 million in Bitcoin. According to a throwaway account from BitcoinHolderThankU, the Reddit user was able to cash out roughly $4.2 million in Bitcoin (BTC) after finding the lost keys to 127 BTC on Dec. 22, when the price of the crypto asset was in the $23,000s. They later liquidated the coins in the middle of the bull run.  ���I spent the next week figuring out how to safely and securely liquidate such a large amount of Bitcoin for the cheapest price possible,��� said the Redditor. ���I went back and forth between different [over-the-counter principal desks] and ultimately ended up selling all 127 Bitcoins for a price of $33,439.02 per coin minus a 0.15% fee. The net was roughly $4.24 million.��� They claim to have earned Bitcoin in 2011 or 2012 through "surveys, watching videos, and completing random tasks" to ultimately use the coins for purchasing in-game currency for the online game DarkOrbit. The private keys were reportedly never really missing, just forgotten on an older model Dell computer as BitcoinHolderThankU ended up not purchasing the currency. Unfortunately, if the Redditor���s account is to be believed, they missed out on $1 million in additional profit by not holding for just a few more weeks. Since December, the price of Bitcoin has passed $41,000 to reach new all-time highs. BitcoinHolderThankU admitted they ���would not have sold all 127 Bitcoin��� if the same situation had played out again.  ���To give myself credit, I did HODL for 8-9 years which is more than the vast majority of crypto users,��� they said. ���I definitely would���ve done things differently if I were given a second chance.��� Despite their sudden fortune, the Redditor says they will avoid ���expensive luxuries��� and intends to put the bulk of the funds into the S&P 500, adding: Unfortunately, not all stories involving misplaced or forgotten keys have such a happy ending. There may still be more than $285 million in Bitcoin lost somewhere in a U.K. garbage dump after an IT worker accidentally threw out his personal laptop with his keys in 2013.	1
With Bitcoin recently reaching a high water mark of an all-time high of $11,500, it���s inevitable that relatives will start asking questions. tried to convince parents to buy me bitcoin in 2010, they laughed at me and i never got bitcoin because of it. When your parents ask questions, it somehow ends up either they don���t agree with your idea or relate it to their younger years. Of course, that���s not a problem, except if you talk about new innovation that has a potential to change their perspective. Bitcoin is one of the hottest topics today, but not everyone can grasp its full potential, especially when you talk to the oldies like your parents. So how can you explain it to them without getting a blank stare? Don���t go explaining Bitcoin using jargons like cryptocurrency, rather explain it using examples they can relate to. Defining something unknown with something equally unknown is a big no-no. You can relate it to a regular money or stocks. Explain that Bitcoin is regular money that has value and can be used to buy goods and services. It is also similar to stocks because the value fluctuates based on the supply and demand. However, it doesn���t give any dividends, unlike Bitcoin. Now here is the part where your parents will ask where do you get Bitcoins and if you have one available in your pocket. We bet your parents will understand the term ���digital money��� so you can use it pertaining to Bitcoin. You can also say that it���s like a debit card or when your boss pays you through direct deposit. The money goes straight into an account without touching a hand. On the question where can you get one, we'll use the example of a mountain called Mount Bitcoin where there are miners. Those who mine Bitcoin do it through their computers with a lot of computational power. It's like mining another scarce resource, gold, which also required specialized and expensive equipment. So, these Bitcoin miners are giving up something in the hopes of getting, maybe, one Bitcoin that can be broken up into many little pieces and distributed in exchange for the kind of money you���re familiar with. This will give your mother some thrill. Imagine having one Bitcoin equalling for $11,000? Who wouldn���t go crazy on spending such amount? Since there���s no transaction charged for spending, say a few pennies, you could use it on websites that accept micro transactions or at least Litecoin. Elon, consider accepting Bitcoin for your cars. It's very easy to sign up for a @coinbase merchant account and integrate it. And there's 0 risk. Good PR too.   Future of cars bought with the future of money. Think about that! For your dad, you can say how a lot of people are using them for investments. Like, they���re putting money in Bitcoins because the returns are better. We bet saying Bitcoin values have been pretty volatile. In the last year, one Bitcoin has jumped from $4,000 to over $11,000 will get your dad jump for excitement. You see it is not easy explaining something new to your parents, but if you follow these points and try hard enough, we���re sure they would understand how Bitcoin works. Who knows they might even invest in cryptocurrencies when they see how they could potentially help ease transactions usually made horrible by traditional payment options.	1
Even those who���ve never invested in Bitcoin before are starting to keep a closer eye on its progress. That���s because the currency has recently soared in value, causing the people who own Bitcoins to get excited and wonder how much more the worth could climb. There are even instances where people with no former interest in cryptocurrency feel now is the time to start becoming involved in the Bitcoin boom. But some onlookers wonder, will the bubble burst, and if so, how long from now? Derek Thompson, who covers economics for The Atlantic as a senior editor, notes it���s hard to determine if Bitcoin is a bubble because it���s an entire industry. However, he thinks Bitcoin's recent patterns are akin to other famous bubbles that burst ��� such as the dotcom bubble. Bitcoin is a topic on everyone���s tongues and minds. Investors make huge life decisions based on Bitcoin worth, and they often make impressive predictions about what���ll happen in the future. People also made those actions in association with other things that went bust, leading individuals to caution history will repeat itself. They say the only thing they���re not certain about is when it���ll happen. One of the reasons why people are buzzing about Bitcoins is because their value has skyrocketed so much. At the beginning of 2017, a Bitcoin was worth $1,000. Now, its value is $5,000. Then, there was a point in September where the per-coin value was nearly $5,000, but it tumbled to $3,200 only two weeks later. For a broader perspective though, it���s necessary to realize that altcoins ��� any cryptocurrency that���s not Bitcoin ��� also fluctuate. That reality could theoretically contribute to worries that Bitcoin is a bubble. They might assume that Bitcoin is as volatile as all the other cryptocurrencies, but compiled market statistics actually indicate it���s the most stable. Even so, some people who intelligently track the market expect volatility. Dave Birch, founder of Consult Hyperion, a leading consultancy in the field of electronic transactions, has even said, ���One does not invest in Bitcoin, one gambles in Bitcoin.��� He backs up that belief by advising people to only invest as much as they���re prepared to lose. If individuals actually did that, the possibility of a bursting Bitcoin bubble wouldn���t be so frightening. Instead, many people have moved all their investments over to the Bitcoin world. A characteristic that attracts many people to Bitcoin is the ability to send and receive money without revealing personal information. They also love the lack of government regulation and feel that by investing in the Bitcoin market, they have more financial freedom. However, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world���s largest hedge fund, calls the idea of private Bitcoin transactions questionable. He doesn���t believe the world���s governments will allow the lack of personal identification information associated with Bitcoin to persist forever and brings up how in the US. The IRS has already demanded some user records associated with the Coinbase website. Furthermore, Chainalysis is a company that specializes in helping identify the people who own the digital wallets used to store Bitcoins. The discovered information reduces fraud and money laundering. Dalio also mentions the high amount of speculation and the lack of spending options for Bitcoin owners. He believes the concept of Bitcoin could work because of that speculation and that people don���t have enough ways to use the Bitcoins they own. For those reasons, he agrees there is a Bitcoin bubble, and that���s the only logical conclusion considering the rapid rise of the Bitcoin���s value. Another thing that could make the Bitcoin bubble burst ��� or at least make investors panic ��� is the fact that approximately 1,000 people hold about 40 percent of all Bitcoins. The individuals tied to large amounts of the cryptocurrency are often referred to as ���whales.��� If they choose to suddenly sell a lot of Bitcoins to take advantage of high market prices, other Bitcoin owners notice. There are also fears the whales could coordinate actions between themselves and work together to make the market fluctuate. Because the laws surrounding cryptocurrency are not concrete, there are uncertainties about what kind of punishments they might face for doing that. Although it���s not hard to find plentiful online resources asserting there���s no doubt Bitcoin is a huge bubble soon to burst, some people provide alternative views. One of them is Ben Davies, co-founder of another cryptocurrency called Glint. He thinks people are not looking at the bigger picture of Bitcoin, and that���s causing them to incorrectly see it as a bubble. Davies also thinks the way people often compare Bitcoin to the bubble associated with tulip bulbs doesn���t hold water. He notes that although the prices of tulips soared then experienced a sharp downturn, that historic event is a ���poor comparison. He asserts the price increases associated with tulips were not similar to the cryptocurrency phenomenon. However, even Davies admits Bitcoin ���has all the hallmarks and antecedents that are the precursor to a bubble.��� This is just a sampling of why so many people strongly believe Bitcoin is a gigantic bubble that���s a substantial concern. To avoid getting into the kind of trouble that could potentially ruin their lives, investors should continue studying the market regularly and seeing how the Bitcoin value fluctuates. Besides, it���s smart to have a plan in place for if or when the bubble bursts. Many of the people who were the most severely affected by previous bubbles that popped were those who didn���t stop to think ���What if?��� and figure out what to do if the worst happened. Failing to do so could mean a person is ignoring history.	2
Stevan Bunnel, former general counsel for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been revealed as the Libra Association���s new leading lawyer. Since leaving the Homeland Security Department in 2017, Bunnell co-chaired the data privacy-focused legal practice O���Melveny & Myers until joining the Libra Association this month. The association���s former general counsel, Robert Werner told Bloomberg Law that he chose to depart from the position after it became clear it meant he would have to relinquish an existing position on the boards of directors for Deutsche Bank Trust Co. ���Steve is an outstanding lawyer and a great guy,��� Werner told Bloomberg. Werner, a former director for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and former senior counsel to The Under Secretary of The Treasury, was appointed by the Libra Association in May. His departure was not publicized, with his name quietly being removed from its list of executives at some point during August. Bunnel���s appointment comes two weeks after Facebook launched a new product division focused on ���payments and commerce opportunities��� with Libra���s co-creator, David Marcus, heading the branch. The division���s first task will be introducing payments into WhatsApp in select emerging markets including Brazil and India. The move follows the suspension of WhatsApp payments by Brazil���s regulators in July after initial trials of the feature, with lawmakers citing concerns that Facebook may be able to capture a monopolistic dominance over the country���s payments sector.	1
It may be hard to believe, but two billion people in the world still do not have a bank account.  Most of them live in low and middle income emerging markets, but even in high-income countries, large numbers of people are unable to use banks to meet their day to day financial needs. This means they don���t have access to the convenience, to security and to interest that banks provide. Moreover, many people have access to a bank account but do not have adequate access to the financial services that banks can provide. These people are known as the underbanked. Even in the United States, for example, 33.5 mln households were recognized in 2015 as unbanked or underbanked, over 25 percent of the population!  Without access to savings and credit, these people cannot participate in the virtuous cycle of economic growth, instead of remaining in a vicious cycle of poverty. Clearly, the unbanked and underbanked together constitute a large market that is not well served by existing institutions. In the third world countries, large banks do not want to extend credit to the underbanked. Even when they do, they charge very high interest rates to offset the risk.  For a time, microfinance institutions provided a way for the underbanked to access much-needed credit, but in recent years, large banks have begun to participate in microfinance.  In the process, the interest charged on microfinance loans has increased significantly and become a major pain point for the unbanked.   Blockchain technology has the potential to help the unbanked and underbanked by allowing them to create their own financial alternatives in an efficient, transparent and scalable manner.  One of the biggest challenges banks face when trying to serve the unbanked is that many of them do not have clear identifying information, making it difficult to implement ���Know Your Customer��� practices.   With Blockchain, individuals can receive a digital identity for use in their banking.  Property rights, long a pain point for many low-income individuals, can also be moved onto the Blockchain, allowing them to enter formal information networks and even leverage their property as collateral. And by making remittances painless and efficient, Blockchain could allow low-income individuals in different countries to save and lend together. The countdown to a future without unbanked people has already started. As examples let���s take a few Ethereum based Blockchain projects that have made serving the unbanked and underbanked their main focus. OmiseGo technology enables peer-to-peer value exchange and payments using a digital wallet platform.  They aim to encourage financial inclusion in emerging markets by creating a platform that other companies beyond Omise can use. Their network claims to decentralize market liquidity and high-scalability payments and to help resolve payments across emerging eWallet payment networks. This could become significant because if successful, it would enable the unbanked to have control over their financial lives and access financial services previously unavailable. WeTrust: their Trusted Lending Circle product (now in beta version) would allow users to create Rotating Savings and Credit Associations on the Blockchain. Benefiting from the finality and transparency provided by Blockchain, this instrument could be seen as a stepping stone for individuals to build a Blockchain powered credit score. Humaniq combines Blockchain and biometrics to create apps that would allow transactions and investment in the third world. Users of the platform could earn tokens at home, using bio-identification procedures, and exchange those tokens for local currencies in an app. Basically, those without any formal identification could have an opportunity to create a digital bio-identification straight from their smartphones. Even simple things like building savings or receiving a loan can be difficult for those who can���t access the security and convenience of a bank account. These unbanked individuals constitute a large market ready to adopt disruptive financial solutions outside of the traditional banking system. Blockchain provides a secure, scalable way to serve the needs of these individuals, and a number of technology companies are leveraging it to usher in a world in which everyone has access to the savings and credit that is an essential building block for economic growth.	2
Bitcoin dipped as low as $12,855 Friday morning as traders watch a steep new correction unfold across cryptocurrency markets. From highs of over $20,000 on some exchanges last weekend, Bitcoin tumbled by up to 30 percent, echoing behavior seen during China���s exchange ban in September and the end of a major bull run in May of this year. At press time, average exchange quotes focused around $14,000, representing a slight recovery for the sub-$13,000 lows earlier today which lasted only briefly. Despite the large numbers involved, Bitcoin���s latest downturn is, in fact, milder than those seen both this year and further back, when corrections up to 45 percent were fairly common. Suffering more were the majority of altcoins, including Bitcoin Cash, which in the 24 hours to press time had lost 32 percent of its value compared to Bitcoin���s average of 18 percent loss. The weight of the losses is clearly visible in overall market statistics. The total cryptocurrency market cap has fallen from $650 bln to $430 bln in a single day. Bitcoin���s ���magic��� month brought growth that surprised investors and observers both in and outside of the industry. Such peaks are often followed by dips or corrections. On Thursday as prices hit $15,000, one online crypto trader and commentator called the situation a ���healthy dip,��� adding optimistically: ���The bounce is going to be insanity.���  THIS IS SUCH A HEALTHY DIP.   The bounce is going to be insanity. pic.twitter.com/iNvoW74Cik	0
It appears when perusing CoinMarketCap that the biggest competition for Bitcoin would be number two - Ethereum. However, according to the Motley Fool, the biggest risk for Bitcoin may actually come from somewhat lower - Litecoin. Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee in 2011 and uses similar protocols as Bitcoin. According to the analysis, Bitcoin and Ethereum are really after completely different marketplaces. Bitcoin is really designed as a currency and store of value protocol built on consensus, while Ethereum is more of a functional platform that also provides a cryptocurrency for internal transactions. However, per the analysis, Litecoin is essentially the same as Bitcoin - a currency and a store of value. While Litecoin has already completed the SegWit upgrade, and offers rapid transaction times, like Bitcoin, the platform allows for simpler protocol upgrades. While only Overstock accepts Litecoin among institutional-level companies, that isn���t the fault of the currency, but a problem of focus. Per the Motley Fool analyst: "Litecoin hasn't been nearly as successful, but that looks to be more a function of its creator, Charles Lee, taking a backseat for years and only recently putting his full effort behind building up his cryptocurrency's use.���  Whether anything can challenge Bitcoin���s dominance or not is still not clear. The Litecoin Foundation, however, believes both should function concurrently without any problems since Litecoin focuses more on payments. Although it���s good to have some exposure on a major media, we don���t believe Litecoin is the biggest competitor for Bitcoin. Bitcoin and Litecoin will have different focuses. Litecoin will definitely focus more on payments. https://t.co/e6u1ZGbsiV	1
Bitcoin prices fell as low as $6000 in 2018 due to a Mt.Gox trustee ���panicking��� and selling $400 mln worth of bitcoins (BTC), reports suggest this week. As multiple news outlets reported from March 7, Nobuaki Kobayashi has sold over 35,000 BTC and 34,000 BCH (Bitcoin Cash) in order to pay the defunct exchange���s creditors. The sales occurred via an exchange, with each individual sale appearing to move Bitcoin markets lower. Former Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles confirmed the transfers took place from December through February. When BTC/USD hit $5900 Feb. 6, Kobayashi had transferred 18,000 BTC ($180 mln) the day prior, entrepreneur Alistair Milne reported on Twitter March 7 quoting the r/mtgoxinsolvency subreddit. Kobayashi himself related the selling practices at a creditors��� meeting the same day, Matt Odell adds. ���They (the trustees) panicked and sold the bottom. Market absorbed it well,��� he wrote by way of comment. 2/ Full list of transfers out of their wallet. More than half of the bitcoin they sold (18k btc) was transferred to an exchange on Feb 5th. The day before bitcoin hit its 3 month low of ~$6000. They panicked and sold the bottom. Market absorbed it well.   h/t @alistairmilne pic.twitter.com/obYgbgBHpx Cointelegraph also reported on the ongoing Mt.Gox FBI investigation this week, as unofficial detective work by UK broadcaster the BBC increased suspicion on an alleged London ���shell��� company that may have helped launder the exchange���s stolen bitcoins. Mt.Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world until hackers stole around 850,000 BTC from it in February 2014. A criminal investigation and attempts to refund users who lost money are still ongoing.	0
The biggest argument against cryptocurrencies is that unlike fiat currencies, they do not have the backing of any government. As multiple rating downgrades show, government support isn���t what it used to be. Moody���s downgraded the credit rating of the United Kingdom from Aa1 to Aa2 on September 22, citing weakening public finances and calling into question the Government���s fiscal consolidation plans. The pound sterling, which had been slowly recovering following the Brexit debacle, promptly lost ground after the rating downgrade. Other rating agencies like S&P and Fitch had downgraded the UK to AA in 2016. The UK suffered its first ratings downgrade, from Moody���s and Fitch, in 2013. This ended a 35 year period of being rated AAA, and it���s been a downward slide ever since. A day before the UK was downgraded by Moody���s, S&P cut the sovereign rating of China, downgrading it from AA- to A+. According to S&P, China���s prolonged credit growth had increased its economic and financial risk. The rating cut brought S&P���s rating in line with other rating agencies. It is ironic that China had taken action against ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges shortly before its own rating was downgraded. Though the sovereign ratings of the United States and Japan have not been cut recently, the trend has been negative. The US was downgraded by S&P from AAA to AA+ in 2011, after being AAA rated for 70 years. Since the dollar is the primary reserve currency of the world, the rating of the United States government has great significance in the global financial markets. With the US national debt crossing $20 tln recently, the country���s creditworthiness likely isn���t  improving any time soon. Japan, which was last Aaa rated by Moody���s in 2009, has seen multiple rating cuts in the last eight years. It is currently rated A1/A+ by Moody���s / S&P. A fiat currency derives its value from the support of the government. While currencies were initially backed by gold, governments across the world felt that this was restricting their ability to print currency and expand their economies, and withdrew from the gold standard long ago. Today, the US dollar, like all fiat currencies, is solely backed by the ���full faith and credit��� of the nation���s government. Clearly, this ���faith and credit��� isn���t what it used to be. Misguided government policies can result in the value of fiat currency depreciating rapidly. Thankfully, Bitcoin is backed by math and nothing else.	1
Binance���s highly popular stock tokens, a relatively recent offering, are being wound down immediately. In an announcement published on Friday, the exchange announced that ���effective immediately,��� stock tokens are unavailable for purchase on Binance.com. As of October 14, 2021, at 7:55 pm UTC, the exchange will no longer support stock tokens at all.  Existing stock token holders will have some time to adjust: While unconfirmed as of the time of writing, Walter Bloomberg has claimed in a tweet that: HONG KONG'S SFC SAYS NO ENTITY IN THE BINANCE GROUP IS LICENSED OR REGISTERED TO CONDUCT "REGULATED ACTIVITY" IN HONG KONG If true, the development would confirm that mounting regulatory pressure on the world���s largest cryptocurrency platform is continuing to hit its operations hard.  In late April, there had already been reports that European and British regulators were scrutinizing Binance���s offering of stock tokens ��� which represent fractions of equity shares in firms such as Tesla and Coinbase ��� for possible non-compliance with securities laws. While initially not commenting on Binance in particular, Germany���s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) went on record at the time, stating that: BaFin soon mentioned Binance explicitly, noting its absence of published prospectuses for the stock tokens. Spring and summer of 2021 have been difficult for Binance on the regulatory front, with multiple countries taking action against it or reportedly investigating its operations from various compliance perspectives.  In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority ordered the exchange to halt all ���regulated activity��� in the country in June. That same month, Japan���s Financial Services Agency accused Binance of operating in the country without proper registration, and new measures against crypto exchanges in the Canadian province of Ontario prompted the exchange to cease all its operations there.	0
First it was The Pirate Bay, then Showtime was caught secretly using page visitor���s processing power to mine cryptocurrency as a form of alternative revenue. It has led to some indignation from users of such sites, as well as worry and fear about the vulnerability of users who are visiting sites and staying on them for a long time. However, there are a few things that can be done to protect yourself. It must be stated that the reasoning put forward, along with an apology, from The Pirate Bay was that they saw it as an alternative to banner advertising, which is tricky for what is essentially an illegal website. Many were happy with the idea of their processor being used, but not happy with the secret nature of it all. If however you are not happy with the idea of being mined, secretly or not, there are a few ways to check if you are indeed a victim of processor pirates. Simply by opening your resource manager on your computer, and looking at the CPU usage, it can quickly become clear if there is indeed something sucking your processing power. A noticeable spike when visiting a certain site that should not be taxing your CPU is an obvious sign of Javascript running that is using your processing power. Additionally, if you have everything closed but CPU usage is still super high, then you may have a crypto mining malware problem. Mining hijacking can occur simply by visiting certain sites, but there have been instances where infected adverts on sites have also led to this CPU pirating. Researchers at security software vendor ESET have explained this process. Thus, running an ad blocker can put a stop to this. Additionally, ad blocking software can also filter out known types of in-browser miners. One such mining script is called Coinhive, which isn���t necessarily malware. Coinhive is trying to approach this as legitimately as possible and condemned Showtime for using their Javascript without alerting users that they would be utilized for mining. Besides from legitimate pirate mining software, there are more sophisticated forms of malware which actively penetrates the system. These are delivered through infected image files or by clicking on links leading to a malicious site. If one of these hits you, you should open up Task Manager and identify the process that is eating up all those compute cycles and terminate it from your resource monitor.	1
The price of Ethereum (ETH) has fallen today, May 28, with tech site TrustNodes blaming the drop on a large sale of ETH on crypto exchange Bitfinex that they attribute to EOS.  Crypto Twitter persona WhalePanda also weighed in with a similar opinion about EOS���s role in today���s ETH sell-off: Wondering who just ragedumped $ETH on @bitfinex. Didn't $EOS still have a lot of ETH and they were using Finex before. pic.twitter.com/l1Hps2jloJ Ethereum is currently trading around $515, down 8.49 percent over a 24 hour period at press time.  Earlier this month, TrustNodes reported that EOS spent around $950 mln in ETH over the previous 30 days, according to a third party analysis of data from crypto data feed Santiment. Today, TrustNodes writes that around 180,000 ETH was traded in one hour on Bitfinex, as opposed to the 20,000 ETH per hour usually recorded by Bitfinex and exchanges GDAX and OKEx. TrustNodes suggests that EOS is the party trading the large amount of ETH, as they note that EOS has spent $1 mln in ETH four days ago, and today the number is raised to around $1.4 mln.  Image: TrustNodes Etherscan shows that wallet address marked as EOSCrowdsale still has around 200,000 ETH, and wallet address marked EOS-Owner around 916,000, together equaling over 1.1 mln ETH. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitfinex has traded in around $238 mln in ETH over a 24 hour period at press time, while OKEx is less than half of that at around $104 mln, and Huobi at around $98 mln.  EOS, which will launch their mainnet on June 2, is currently trading for around $12, down by over 4 percent over a 24 hour period at press time.	0
Bitcoin is under heavy surveillance on Bali, an island in the Indonesian archipelago, according to local reports. Central Bank officials are seeking to crack down on the use of the cryptocurrency anywhere in the nation. Causa Iman Karana, head of Bank Indonesia's representative office in Bali said: "We found out from some postings on social media that Bali appeared to have become a haven for Bitcoin transactions. The next step is we will ban them as mandated by the law. We ask them not to use it anymore. Along with the Directorate of Special Crime Investigation unit, we will enforce the rule that all transactions in Indonesia must use rupiah.��� The country had previously been reported as having significant local adoption of Bitcoin usage, but recent reports indicate that the government is trying to curtail the use of digital currencies. The risk of money laundering and criminal activity has led to the increased scrutiny. The harsh rhetoric against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies falls more in line with the Chinese and potential South Korean bans than the more lenient Australian position.	0
Generally, joy and optimism are awaiting the new market players that will join the Bitcoin realm, their pockets full of fresh cash to invest and add to the demand, when futures are traded by CME and CBOE on Dec. 10 and 18. The news from CME even sent Bitcoin price to a new all-time high of $7,000; thus it is unsurprising that the small fry on forums and around the dinner table are excited about the prospect of new investors coming in on the backs of futures. But futures are scary things, and perhaps there is also a dark side coming to the Bitcoin market as now people can profit just as much from the drive diving as they can from it rising. There could be some big swells from some big whales on its way. As it stands, the man with a fraction of a coin is as happy as the man with 100 the way the Bitcoin market operates at the moment. The more the price rises, the happier each of them are. Higher price means better returns and more money for nothing. There is no need for the big name players in the Bitcoin market to cause too many waves as they are currently profiting happily from the way things are going. However, futures introduce a different type of playing field as whales, and these are whales that make Bitcoin whales look like shrimp, have an incentive to drive the market down. Cash markets, such as Bitcoin, are there to serve investors, but a futures market is something different, it is there for people to hedge against risk. It is a pessimistic way to invest, and it bases itself on profiting when things go bad. Futures are seen a lot in farming as crops are subject to so much volatility (from pricing and markets to weather and pests) so a farmer will sell his corn on a futures market to guarantee the price when he does eventually get his crop to market. At the same time, someone who wants the farmer���s crops will buy that futures contract in the hopes of securing a price should the price of the crops rise. Both of these players are now hedging on opposite ends and a balance is essentially struck. Understanding futures like that, and applying the model to Bitcoin, there is a clear gap. Miners sell their ���futures contract��� to make sure they get the price for the coins they intend to mine in the future. Bitcoin holders are doing the same sort of thing in order to hedge their downside. But now, there is no hedger on the buying side, so there is no equilibrium and the pressure is asserted on the downside. There is balance coming from the buyers, the speculators, but that equilibrium has always been met by a strong Bull market. Now, there is a reason to be a strong bear with Bitcoin futures as three is profit to be made hedging against Bitcoin. Those entering the market, flush with never before seen cash, could enter as a bear and do all they can to drop the market. Because the market is still just in its infancy, there is a chance that bears could overwhelm it, and still profit.	1
Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee has predicted that miners may shut up shop after the coin���s upcoming halving this summer.  In an interview with Australian crypto news site Mickey on July 10, Lee reflected on the possible implications for Litecoin���s mining ecosystem when the planned halving kicks in and current block rewards on the network are reduced by 50%. ���It���s always kind of a shock to the system,��� he said, explaining:  ���When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine. If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time. For litecoin it���s three and a half days before the next change, so possibly like seven days of slower blocks, and then after that, the difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine.��� Given that the reduction of mining rewards reduces the cryptocurrency���s supply, anticipation of the halving is generally thought to be accompanied by a corresponding price appreciation ��� but Lee gave a more nuanced perspective of how supply, demand and market sentiment interrelate: ���In terms of the price, the halvening should be priced in because everyone knows about it since the beginning. But the thing is people kind of expect the price to go up. So a lot of people are buying in because they expect the price to go up and that���s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, because they���re buying in, the price does actually go up.��� As Mickey notes, Litecoin���s last halving ��� back in August 2015 ��� saw the coin peaking in early July of that year, going on to lose almost 50% in value by the time of the block rewards reduction ��� and hitting a 75% in the halving���s aftermath. To press time, Litecoin is reporting an almost 36% gain on its 3-month chart, but remains almost 67% down from its all-time highs in December 2017, according to Coin360 data.   LTC 3-month price chart. Source: Coin360 Meanwhile, Anthony Pompliano ��� the co-founder of crypto asset management firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets ��� has recently predicted that one of the largest drivers of continued price appreciation for top crypto Bitcoin (BTC) will be its halving, citing classic supply-demand economics as a major contributing factor to his $100,000 forecast by the end of 2021.	0
A Georgia state senator has reported to jail over allegedly lying about the theft of cryptocurrency mining equipment worth $300,000, The Guardian reported Dec. 27. Republican Michael Williams, who originally reported the alleged theft in May, made a false police report and gave a false statement, court documents claim. Williams had said servers with a value of $300,000, which had been used to mine unnamed cryptocurrencies, had disappeared from his office premises, local daily news outlet Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Dec. 20. Prosecutors are considering the possibility that the theft never took place, and last month Williams was indicted by grand jury on three counts and subsequently handed himself in to custody. A full verdict has yet to surface, however, with the accused and his attorney waiting on prosecutors��� evidence. ���Right now, our position is Mr. Williams did not do this,��� the attorney, A.J. Richman, said Dec. 26 quoted by another local outlet Gainesville Times. Richman added: ���We���re not really apprised of their evidence yet. They haven���t disclosed that. I���m sure they will soon, but at this point, we don���t know what it is they���re saying other than what the indictment says.��� Williams had previously co-sponsored a cryptocurrency payments bill for the Georgian Senate, while his campaigns were marked by a pronounced anti-immigrant policy featuring a ���deportation bus��� referring to Mexican immigrants that drew considerable condemnation.	0
Cryptocurrency-related advertisements have stopped appearing on Chinese search engine Baidu and social media platform Weibo, amidst reports of China���s government tightening cryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offering regulations on Sunday, Feb. 4. The Financial Times of the People���s Bank of China (PBOC) was told today, Feb. 4, that China will further increase regulatory pressure on cryptocurrency exchange sites and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Chinese news site Sina reported. In September 2017, China banned both ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges. Some of those businesses responding by relocating off the mainland to Hong Kong. Now, Sina reports, Chinese government plans to mitigate that by banning domestic and foreign ���virtual currency exchange websites.��� Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post news site reported that when the terms, in Chinese, ���bitcoin,��� ���cryptocurrency,��� and ���ICO��� were searched on Chinese search-engine Baidu and microblog Weibo, no obvious paid sponsored content came up alongside the expected organic results. While Baidu had stopped advertising cryptocurrency-related searches back in August 2016, it is unclear when they started allowing them again, and they have not confirmed any new crypto-based advertising block. Weibo has confirmed that they have banned cryptocurrency-related advertising. In a similar turn of events, Facebook banned ads of cryptocurrencies and ICOs last week, citing the large amount of fintech companies on Facebook���s platform that are ���[not operating] in good faith.��� Facebook���s decision to ban these ads was received favorably on the /r/Bitcoin sub-Reddit page, where users commented on the many scams they have seen for crypto on social media. In reference to scam Facebook ads, user erisiamk wrote, ���Anyone who would actually buy because they were convinced by a Facebook ad will probably not research crypto properly and end up making more bad decisions and spreading more FUD.���	0
The IRS is actively seeking out tax evaders using Bitcoin, employing tools like Chainalysis to unmask them. Many people believe that Bitcoin is anonymous, but it is in fact pseudonymous. All transactions linked to a particular address are visible on the Blockchain, which is public and transparent. However, it is not possible to link a particular wallet address to the real world identity of a person/company without any additional information. While good privacy practices can prevent leakage of information, there is always a point where Bitcoin transactions touch the traditional monetary system (when you use it in a store or when you sell it at an exchange) and proof of identity can become necessary. Working backwards, it is possible to unravel the chain of Bitcoin transactions to some extent. The IRS has been trying hard to obtain details about Bitcoin transactions and detect cases of tax evasion. The IRS had previously requested Coinbase to give it details about its users for the period 2013-15. As per a document referenced by Daily Beast, the IRS has also awarded a contract to Chainalysis to analyse transactions and unmask users. Chainalysis uses data scraped from public forums, leaked data sources including dark web, exchange deposits and withdrawals to tag and identify transactions. The IRS expects to use this data to catch tax cheats as well as criminals who sell drugs and other illegal goods and services for Bitcoin. There have been Bitcoin mixing services which specialized in obfuscating the source of Bitcoins. Bitmixer.io was the leader amongst mixing services, before it announced its decision to mysteriously shut down. Coinjoin transactions also make it difficult to trivially link Bitcoin transactions. Services like Joinmixer help like-minded individuals combine transactions to enhance privacy. Moreover, while Chainalysis claims that it has information on a high percentage of Bitcoin addresses (25 percent), it is possible that these could be addresses with poor privacy practices. Chainalysis may not be able to unmask transactions where users have intentionally tried to obfuscate the transaction trail. While the IRS may be breaking its head in trying to unmask those behind Bitcoin transactions, its efforts will be futile if extended to the wider cryptocurrency space. Certain currencies like Dash, Monero and ZCash have inbuilt privacy features, which makes it difficult to track transactions. If people shift from Bitcoin to secondary currencies like these, the IRS would have its hands full when trying to detect specific cases of tax evasion. Moreover, the resources that it would take to investigate these currencies would make the whole exercise infeasible. It is possible that a simple and clear tax regime with respect to cryptocurrencies may be what is required to gain higher compliance with respect to tax in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are currently in a gray area and this may prevent people from fully disclosing their cryptocurrency holdings to tax authorities.	0
Max Keiser has publicly called arrested Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal a ���poster boy for why you should buy Bitcoin.��� In an episode of the Keiser Report on Russia Today, the outspoken Keiser said the world���s richest Arab ���wouldn���t have the problems��� he is currently facing had he bought Bitcoin.  Bin Talal is currently under ���house arrest��� in the Ritz hotel in the Saudi capital Riyadh, where he is reportedly sleeping on an inflatable mattress. Previously, he had said he ���doesn���t believe in this Bitcoin thing��� and that the virtual currency is ���Enron in the making.��� Saudi authorities have confiscated bin Talal���s assets totaling around $33 bln as part of an alleged crackdown on corruption by King Salman. ���He dissed Bitcoin and now he had all his wealth confiscated,��� Keiser continued. Suspicions are meanwhile mounting as to the nature of the multiple arrests of Saudi princes. Assets worth $800 bln are thought of as targets and western media have posed the question as to whether King Salman���s move is more to take back cash than stamp out corrupt practices. Billionaires in the country are reportedly rushing to get assets offshore before the perhaps inevitable tide reaches their own wealth.	1
Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen back below $8,000, as the crypto markets continue to slump in the wake of a week of mixed crypto news, ranging from the FUD fallout caused by the upcoming Google crypto ad ban to several wins for Blockchain adoption seen in China and Canada, Coin360 data shows.  BTC is currently trading at around $7,729, down almost seven percent over a 24 hour period by press time.  Amidst the falling market prices since the new year, BTC���s market dominance has been slowly rising, contributing to BTC���s slower price fall as compared to the other top coins on CoinMarketCap. At press time, BTC���s market dominance was 44.3 percent.  Ethereum (ETH) is getting close to $500, trading for around $515 and down almost 15 percent over a 24 hour period by press time. Ripple���s (XRP) price is also falling, trading for around $0.61 percent and down almost 11 percent over a 24 hour period by press time.  Crypto Twitter personality @WhalePanda tweeted this morning about the futility of looking for concrete explanations for large price drops in the crypto markets, referencing the ongoing US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe: Since people are always trying to look for explanations on why there are dumps... Why did $ETH dump so hard? Some ICOs/big holders trying to get rid of it because of the ongoing investigations or other information we don't know yet? ?? The only coin in the green out of the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap is IOTA, trading at around $1.29 and up almost 14.5 percent by press time. Cardano is down the most of the top ten coins, trading for around $0.14 and down almost 19 percent over a 24 hour period to press time. Total market cap is below $300 bln, currently at around $295 bln. The falling market prices had previously been attributed to a sell off of $400 mln in BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) by a trustee of the now defunct Mt. Gox exchange. However, a newly released report from a trustee meeting early this month denies any correlation between the large sell off and BTC/BCH prices, a claim not every crypto enthusiast believes.	0
The new SegWit2x, a revival of the original hard fork designed to help with the scalability issues of Bitcoin, was scheduled to happen at Bitcoin block number 501451. That block was mined at around 6PM UTC, Dec. 28, and the team behind the project announced its official launch: The Long Awaited Launch of New Bitcoin SegWit2X Fork Finally Took Place! pic.twitter.com/GC46rYFoOI The SegWit2x movement has originally started in May 2017, as a direct result of the New York Agreement (NYA). The idea behind the agreement, originally signed by more than 50 leading Bitcoin companies, was to achieve a compromise on how to scale Bitcoin for a larger audience. One of the sides, the ���small blockers,��� wanted to implement the second-layer solution called SegWit, which did indeed take place on Aug. 24, 2017. That was the first part of the compromise. The other part of the deal was designed to appease the ���big blockers��� by increasing Bitcoin���s block size limit to 2 megabytes. However, this was never followed through with, directly violating the agreement. The fork was slated to happen on Nov. 16. However, as the developers unveiled the actual code for the hard fork, a vastly negative reaction from the Bitcoin community immediately followed. The lack of replay protection, along with general concerns about the safety of a possible hard fork, gave rise to an entire movement against SegWit2x, aptly called #no2x. After several weeks of controversy, the fork was cancelled on Nov. 8, about a week before its scheduled arrival. The team tasked with creating the code for SegWit2x shelved the plan due to a lack of consensus. The cancellation, apparently, only lasted so long, as the fork was seemingly revived in late December by a different group of developers. A website has been set up, stating  the mission, the roadmap and the team behind the new fork that was set to take place on Bitcoin block 501451. Reports began surfacing over the past several days that focused on several inconsistencies on the project���s home page. First and foremost, the team behind the new fork has nothing to do with the people behind the original New York Agreement and the SegWit2x that was cancelled in November. They have even admitted it themselves in a chat with the Finance Magnates news site. There is very little information available online about the team members listed on the official website. For example, the project���s supposed founder, Jaap Terlouw, only has a half-empty LinkedIn profile. There he claims that he is the ���main developer��� of the new SegWit2x, with no other sources to corroborate his status as a ���developer.��� Moreover, the project���s GitHub account is just 9 days old as of press time, which makes it even younger than some of the earlier announcements of the upcoming fork in the press. Adding to the list of concerns, the code stored in that GitHub account indicates that the team members were planning to assign themselves 6 mln premined coins, a whopping 28% of the total supply of 21 mln:  This constitutes an incredible degree of control over the project that some would argue a scrupulous team should not have. Likewise, it represents an enormous (and instant) potential profit to the team members. This could encourage a quick pump-and-dump. Paid-for press releases distributed to various Blockchain-related websites, such as Bitcoinist and even the Russian-language VC.ru, were highlighting the tremendous increase in the value of the futures contracts of the new SegWit2x, just as some other news outlets have been voicing concerns about the intentions of the team behind the project. Topping the list of reasons for suspicion is the bizarre promise to issue ���a proportional number of Satoshi Nakamoto`s Bitcoins��� to all BTC holders after the fork takes place. No indication has been offered of how would the team actually be able to access the coins that have been held by the mysterious creator of Bitcoin since the earliest days of its existence.	1
ThinkMarkets chief market analyst Naeem Aslam predicts that bitcoin (BTC) will hit somewhere between $60,000 and  $100,000 during its next bull run, according to a Fox Business interview on June 24. Aslam had previously predicted on June 17 that BTC would hit $10,000 in ���a couple of weeks,��� citing institutional involvement as a major driver. Bitcoin successfully reached the five figure mark on June 22, marking a record high that has not been seen in over one year. According to Aslam, the major price points to look out for now are $20,000 and $50,000. He argues that by hitting $20,000, discussion will move from conservative estimates exceeding the number one cryptocurrency���s all-time high to forecasts of $50,000; from there, breaking $50,000 will move the price target to $100,000.  Aslam also discussed the use of BTC as a means to avoid risk, comparing BTC, which is often called ���digital gold,��� with gold. He remarks that in the last two months, there is a huge spike in price for these two assets, which he attributes to a lack of confidence in the stock market along with the ongoing U.S.���China trade war. Aslam also points to unrest and even a potential war in the Middle East as the biggest driver of recent growth in these diversifying assets. He also remarks that BTC now has a reputation as a safe haven for storing wealth, saying there is evidence of investors ���parking��� their capital in the leading crypto. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin podcast host Trace Mayer said that the bitcoin price in 2019 will likely close at $21,000, according to the trajectory posited by his ���Mayer Multiple��� price indicator. The Mayer Multiple reportedly is an equation that involves dividing current BTC price by its 200-day moving average.	2
The team behind meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has issued a public warning against ongoing online scams that primarily target altcoin investors interested in SHIB tokens.  The proactive scam alert came in the form of a tweet detailing the various methods used to dupe unsuspecting victims from the Shiba Inu community.  Stay Alert & Safe #ShibArmy!We've been made aware of a recent scam, traveling social media, and other communication platforms. Here's a quick video to provide more information on the matter. pic.twitter.com/UOh50WsJSQ The warning further stated, ���A fake Shiba Telegram group is being shared across all social media. The scammers impersonate official accounts and create fake users. These scammers reply to general posts.��� While Shiba Inu attracts aspiring crypto millionaires and billionaires, bad actors have ramped up efforts, targeting unwary investors on social media platforms including Twitter and Telegram. Some of the common methods used to contact potential victims are impersonating official accounts and targetting hashtags such as #shib #shibarmy #leash #shibaswap and #bone. Furthermore, Shiba Inu���s scam alert highlighted that the community is not offering any kind of promotions including airdrops, bonuses, giveaways or gifts. As a general rule, investors are expected to refrain from sharing wallet keys, credentials or joining and following fake social media accounts.  Taking inspiration from Shiba Inu���s success, numerous dog-themed tokens have started to flood the crypto marketplace. Most recently, SHIB hit an all-time high of $0.000086 on Oct. 28 but has been struggling to keep up its value.  Shiba Inu���s development team has also developed and released another token called Doge Killer (LEASH), which has also seen 130.3% gains recently. In addition to the token���s mainstream adoption, a growing community of investors has placed SHIB in some of the most popular crypto exchanges including Binance.US and Crypto.com.  The hype around the Dogecoin (DOGE) spinoff is attributed to an extended bull market period that returned high profits for small-time investments. As Cointelegraph reported, an $8,000 investment made by a 35-year-old supermarket warehouse manager in early 2021 is now worth over $1 million.	0
It was Doge day afternoon all over again on Wednesday as Dogecoin (DOGE) continued its assault on the cryptocurrency market capitalization rankings. The meme coin overtook XRP to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by implied market capitalization after climbing to a per-coin valuation of $0.69 ��� a target that was specifically set by traders on social media. But cryptocurrency���s latest media darling may not be as wholesome as it seems. For all the hype surrounding Dogecoin (and its de facto master, Elon Musk), publicly available data suggests relatively few people are actually using the blockchain, and those who do use it account for an incredibly large portion of its overall activity. Consider that the dollar value of coins sent across the Dogecoin blockchain on Tuesday exceeded $58 billion. That figure was 70% higher than the amount transferred on Bitcoin ($34 billion) and 260% higher than on Ethereum ($16 billion). Digging into on-chain data further, we see that despite Dogecoin moving a higher value of coins than the two largest cryptocurrencies in the world, it achieved this with a mere fraction of their transactions. Over 1.4 million transactions were counted on the Ethereum blockchain yesterday, according to data from Bitinfocharts, while close to 300,000 were counted on Bitcoin. Compare this to just 76,000 recorded on the Dogecoin blockchain, and an apparent wealth gap begins to emerge. Indeed, when looking at Dogecoin���s average transaction value on the day in question, it stood at almost double that recorded on Bitcoin (BTC). The average DOGE transaction value stood at $800,000, compared to $420,000 on BTC. Its statistics relative to Ethereum paint an even more dire picture ��� Dogecoin���s average transaction value exceeded Ethereum���s by 8,000%, despite processing only 5% of the number of transactions. Combined with the long-standing reality that one single address holds 28% of all coins in existence, while just 12 account for 67%, it becomes clear that Dogecoin isn���t exactly the people���s champion that interested parties would have the public believe. A recently published report by Galaxy Digital piled on the misery regarding Dogecoin���s general lack of authenticity as a true cryptocurrency project. Titled ���Dogecoin: The Most Honest Sh*tcoin,��� the report highlighted the fact that Dogecoin���s GitHub repository (where updates to the blockchain���s code are logged by developers) hasn���t been touched since 2017. What���s more, the number of fully synced nodes (computers running copies of the Dogecoin blockchain) is just 26% of the overall node count, suggesting few people are willing to make the effort to maintain the blockchain���s network security. But even if the Dogehouse seems like a ghost town, the glaring reality remains that Dogecoin is the best performing digital asset in the cryptocurrency space. The coin has recorded 14,000% growth since Jan. 1, when it was priced at a fraction of a cent. Both credit and blame for Doge���s seemingly irrational ascent have been placed on the ���Dogefather��� himself, Elon Musk, who has taken great pleasure in posting Doge memes to his 52 million followers on Twitter throughout much of 2021. However, it should also be noted that the coin���s recent peak of $0.69 is the same price target set by Reddit traders intent on artificially pumping DOGE���s valuation. The price point was originally intended to be reached on April 20 ��� a joke on top of a joke on 4/20 day. Dogecoin only reached a price of $0.420 at the time (boom), but now, a little over two weeks later, it has finally achieved its jocular goals. The ultimate price point being pursued by traders is $1.  If more evidence is needed that markets are not always rational, look no further than this year���s GameStop pump, where the share price of a near-dead brand increased by over 9,000%. ���Dogecoin has always been a joke, and the joke keeps getting funnier,��� stated the Galaxy Digital report. Author of the report and head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital Alex Thorn did praise Dogecoin for its lack of pretense, noting that the coin���s fortunes weren���t tied to foundation announcements or developer promises and that its only goal was to elicit a reaction. ���Dogecoin���s longevity is ensured so long as one truism remains: people love a good joke,��� Thorn ended.	1
Update: Nathaniel Popper, a reporter from New York Times, has claimed in a tweet that the subpoenas were delivered on Dec. 6 and not last week, according to ���source familiar with the matter.��� Major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and token issuer Tether have received subpoenas from US regulators as questions continue to arise about the latter���s ���true��� value. As Bloomberg reports Tuesday, Jan. 30 quoting sources who opted to remain anonymous, Tether���s notional USD peg has come under increasing suspicion, with authorities ���routinely��� querying its legal providence. ���We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations,��� the publication quotes emailed statements from Bitfinex and Tether sent this week. ���It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.��� Controversy has swelled around Tether, whose chief executive officer Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is also the CEO of Bitfinex, after volatility and rumors of Bitcoin price manipulation surfaced late last year. While it remains unclear as to what specifically triggered the subpoenas, which both companies received last week, the move comes as less of a surprise amid the flurry of suspicion surrounding them on social media in January. In reactions following the news, cryptocurrency industry commentators had mixed opinions. WhalePanda, who has become known for his trading and business-related tweets, noted the lack of connection between Bitfinex, Tether and US authorities. I'm a clueless idiot but what does the CTFC have to do with Bitfinex (not US company), Tether (not US company) and the fact that Bitfinex doesn't allow any US customers on their platform. Although it might be from before that they enforced that rule. Meanwhile, Bitcoin prices have taken a plunge on Tuesday, likely caused in part by the news. Charlie Shrem considered those selling off Bitcoin to be ���truly stupid,��� as Tether holdings presented the risk and cryptocurrency presented a ���way out��� of any financial losses. Panic sellers of #bitcoin are truly stupid. Think about it, if you are holding Tether, the only way out would be to *buy* crypto with it. https://t.co/15NBl7IeP7 As of press time Tuesday, Tether was trading at an average of $0.998, just below parity, with prices having swung as high as $1.05 in the last month. Bitcoin fell an average of 11% according to data from Coinmarketcap.	0
Whether you���re ready for it or not, it���s going to happen. We will witness another Bitcoin hard fork in three months. This time it will be backed by the technical team that proposed Segwit2x. Leading the pact is Bitcoinj developer Jean-Pierre Rupp, who filed an announcement to increase the block size to 2 MB and continues to work on SegWit2x. According to Jeff Garzik, Bloq founder and Segwit2x developer, the proposal has received ���general approval��� from Segwit2x members. On the other hand we have Bitcoin Core developers who remain adamant in opposition to SegWit2x and have already said that the upcoming Bitcoin Core client 0.15.0 will automatically disconnect nodes supporting the SegWit2x fork. May 23, 2017 marked the day when the Bitcoin scaling debate ���supposedly��� ended. Digital Currency Group released a statement declaring that 58 signatories from both camps -- SegWit supporters (aka Bitcoin Core) and those who prefered to increase the block size (aka Bitcoin miners) - agreed to increase the block size to 2 MB. The agreement was termed as the New York Agreement (NYA). The idea was to activate SegWit using BIP 91 and then 90 days later hard fork the base block size to 2 MB. According to the Digital Currency Group, SegWit2x is supported by: Clearly, NYA didn���t go as planned. Now that SegWit has already been locked-in and we have Bitcoin Cash as a result of the Aug. 1 hard fork, many are left wondering what was the point of the New York Agreement. The Segwit2x working group has announced the roadmap for the next three months. The team plans to let Bitcoin miners choose to run new software at block 494,784 on the blockchain. This block is expected to occur sometime in November. The announcement, called ���Bitcoin Upgrade at Block 494,784,��� states: ���During the month of November 2017, approximately 90 days after the activation of Segregated Witnesses in the Bitcoin blockchain, a block between 1 MB and 2 MB in size will be generated by Bitcoin miners in a move to increase network capacity. At this point it is expected that more than 90 percent of the computational capacity that secures the Bitcoin network will carry on mining on top of this large block.��� If this proposal goes through as planned, SegWit2x could lead to another Bitcoin hard fork, potentially creating yet another version of Bitcoin. The SegWit2x plan could also drastically fail if the team is unable to get miners��� support. It remains to be seen how many miners are willing to dedicate their computational power to yet another Blockchain. Bitcoin Core developers got what they wanted. With the help of SegWit they���d be able to build the ultimate scaling solution: the lightning network. Core recently announced that the next Bitcoin Core client 0.15.0, due to release before November, would no longer connect to nodes running SegWit2x. Bitcoin���s very nature is to have a decentralized system and be governed by consensus as opposed to a more traditional top-down hierarchy in which few people are in charge of decision making. One could argue that Core developers are somehow controlling Bitcoin���s decision-making and consensus is merely there for the sake of it. Here���s how it works: Miners are actually the ones that write blocks on the blockchain. User-run nodes maintain an up-to-date ledger across the network. When miners create new blocks, the nodes on Bitcoin���s network propagate those blocks to all clients. That being said, Core���s announcement could have serious repercussions. Bitcoin Core nodes will no longer talk to nodes that run the SegWit2x code. So the miners will still broadcast their blocks to the network, but nodes running the Bitcoin Core client will only relay blocks to other nodes running the same client. This decreases the level of decentralization and this is why even though we already have Bitcoin Cash, Segwit2x supporters are keen on splitting the chain once again. November could get as dramatic as August for Bitcoin, and the prices may become more volatile as we get closer the ���date���. If the claimed 83.28 percent of hashing power remains committed to the SegWit2x plan, the hard fork in November is inevitable. It is important to understand 17 percent of the hash power didn���t sign the NYA. Signatories of  NYA are under no obligation to exclusively mine the ���2x chain���. If they don���t see Segwit2x mining as being profitable, they could easily change their mind and keep mining for the main Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash for that matter.	1
There has been a protracted debate on the actual identity of Bitcoin, whether it should be regarded as a currency or a commodity. With reasonable support on each side of the debate based on its inherent characteristics, a huge segment of the ecosystem is of the opinion that Bitcoin can, and should be regarded as both a currency and a commodity. Whatever definition attached to Bitcoin, the constant variation in price offers an opportunity for investors to make a profit by trading the cryptocurrency, either as a long term investment or in a speculative short term pattern. Bashir Aminu, Bitcoin trader and convener of online crypto group Cryptogene, explains the basic Bitcoin trading process as follows: ���If you buy Bitcoins at one price and then sell them for a higher price, you make a profit of the difference between those two prices, less any commission that you paid. However, if the price goes down, you will be in the uncomfortable position of having to either sell them at a loss or hold and hope the price goes back up while risking higher and higher losses if the price continues to drop.��� There are two major types of traders in the Bitcoin market, they are ���long term��� traders and ���short term��� traders. Each of these group of traders are classified by how long they may wish to hold onto a given position of trade. Long term traders are usually involved in studying price trends over long periods of time. This informs their decision to buy and hold Bitcoin also over long periods with the hope of taking profit at a price higher than their original entry point. With Bitcoin still in its developmental stages, a lot of users suggest that this is a good time to buy. This suggestion is based on the assumption that with increasing use case scenario and more adoption, demand for Bitcoin and its associated technology will increase, thereby creating more demand for the cryptocurrency which will automatically cause an eventual increase in value. Glimpses of this have been observed with the surge in Bitcoin price which coincides with a boost in its market capitalization and volume of trade. On the other hand, short-term traders analyze the intraday behavior of Bitcoin price and seek to take advantage of the swings in price. These traders thrive in market volatility, a factor that is presently characteristic of Bitcoin. In its early stages, the swings in Bitcoin price was usually so huge as every little event within the crypto space had very serious impact on the price of the cryptocurrency. As adoption grows and Bitcoin becomes more stable, price volatility has reduced considerably and experts think it is a better time to trade the cryptocurrency, compared to an earlier time. ���Bitcoin is certainly safer to invest in now than it was a couple of years ago���, says Aminu. Aminu describes Bitcoin trading as extremely profitable if you play your cards well. According to him, it all depends on the market movement pattern. He tells Cointelegraph that Bitcoin value rises and falls dramatically throughout each trading day, jumping in whole dollar amounts. A phenomenon which he identifies as very risky when misjudged. Based on his trading experience, Aminu outlines a set of rules for newcomers who may wish to profit from the Bitcoin market as follows:	2
A PayPal user reports their account has been restricted after they traded crypto too frequently using the platform. According to U.S.-based Reddit user u/TheCoolDoc, PayPal sent them a message stating it had permanently limited their account ���due to potential risk.��� The user said they had made at least 10 crypto transactions within a week, purchasing during dips and selling when the price was high, and PayPal had asked for an explanation for each transaction. ���The system flagged my account thinking I was selling items worth $10,000 in one week when I hadn't done so in the last 6 years I���ve held a PayPal account,��� the user said. ���I submitted the stuff for review with my photo ID and wrote ���PayPal Crypto��� for each crypto transaction because what else could I say?��� In a matter of hours, PayPal reportedly sent a message stating that the user would ���not be able to conduct any further business��� using the platform. The user stated that the remaining funds in the account ��� $462 ��� were placed on a 180-day hold, but they have since used other means to withdraw them.  The platform imposed a $10,000 limit ��� recently changed to $20,000 ��� for crypto purchases made within a week for U.S. customers, a limit the Reddit user denies exceeding. ���I genuinely 100% know I did nothing wrong and it���s a misunderstanding because they think I made 50+ buy/sell transactions in a span of 1 week of items, when it���s just crypto,��� said u/TheCoolDoc.  PayPal announced on Nov. 12 that it would begin allowing eligible users in the United States to use cryptocurrencies for trading and payments. Reddit user u/Cryptix001 also reported problems with the platform���s handling of crypto transactions:  The platform���s policy states that it charges no transaction fees for users buying or selling crypto until 2021, and there are no fees for holding crypto. Reddit user u/bittabet suggested that a partial explanation for PayPal���s actions could be that it loses money with users conducting high-volume trades. ���PayPal isn���t a crypto exchange, their service is meant for people to hold Bitcoin with and then spend it at their merchants when they turn on that ability,��� the Reddit user stated. ���If you go and trade constantly they lose a ton of money covering those fees since they���re not charging any fees right now. Their service is supposed to be more like a Bitcoin bank account, not a trading account.��� Even if the platform removed the restrictions from their account, TheCoolDoc said they would ���never buy a Satoshi of crypto��� from PayPal again. Cointelegraph reached out to PayPal for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.	0
With Bitcoin's price continuing to hold close to $13,000, one crypto wallet has moved more than $1 billion of the digital asset. According to on-chain data, a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet holder moved more than 88,857 BTC ��� worth roughly $1.15 billion ��� for a fee of only 0.00027847 BTC, or $3.58 at time of publication. The coins were confirmed in block 654,364 on Oct. 26.  Data from analytics platform CrystalBlockchain appears to show that the user sent the coins from an address labeled as a Xapo Bitcoin wallet. Because Coinbase Custody acquired Xapo���s institutional business in 2019, it is possible that the $1.1 billion in Bitcoin originated from the U.S.-based exchange. This transaction is the largest movement of any cryptocurrency by fiat value, with the Bitfinex exchange setting the previous record in April. It transferred 161,500 BTC ��� $1.1 billion at the time ��� for a fee of only $0.68.  Neither of these transactions were actually the largest amount of Bitcoin to ever be moved. That honor goes to a 550,000 BTC transaction made on November 16, 2011 by the Mt. Gox exchange. Worth $1.32 million at that time, that amount of Bitcoin could be liquidated for more than $7 billion today.	1
An Italian woman has been sentenced to six years in jail in Denmark for hiring the murder of her former boyfriend using Bitcoin, according to Reuters. The 4.1 Bitcoin payment was made in March at a time when that amount would be worth around $4,000. The transfer to the hitman���s digital wallet was presented to the court as evidence. The murder was never carried out, though, and the intended target was present during the sentencing and spoke with the woman after the fact. Digital currencies��� supposed anonymity has made them a popular choice for criminals. Dark web sites like AlphaBay and SilkRoad have used Bitcoin for transactions for exactly this reason. Other opponents of Bitcoin have accused the cryptocurrency of being used particularly for money laundering and criminal pursuits. At the same time, proponents of digital currency readily point out that the overwhelming majority of money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes are conducted with fiat currencies. Si��n Jones, founder of EDCAB - the European Digital Currency & Blockchain Technology - told a European Parliament committee: "The perception that cryptocurrencies are anonymous is largely myth. The corollary that cryptocurrencies are mainly used to launder money is grossly-overstated and unsubstantiated. The ability to trace past transactions render virtual currencies highly unsuitable for money laundering.���	0
The Chinese government intends to further regulate the crypto economy, according to reports from Yicai, the Chinese financial news agency. The report indicates that the government has only just begun to regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs, after Monday���s ban on ICOs. The news of the ban left many ICO companies seeking to return money to investors in order to remain government compliant. Many ICOs canceled, while some continued unfazed. The announcement cited sources close to financial decision makers within the government who indicated that the ban was just the tip of the proverbial iceberg regarding regulations on cryptocurrencies and their spin-offs. The cryptocurrency markets responded to the news rapidly, with huge sell-offs in Ethereum (down 15 percent on the week) and other coins linked to ICOs. Chinese cryptos also lost value, with NEO dropping as much as 30 percent on huge volumes. Other countries have also promised increased regulation. South Korea recently stated its intention to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, and may also move to ban ICOs. The news only compounds the questions regarding cryptocurrency values and stability, given their lack of government sponsorship and approval.	0
A great many of Visa���s cryptocurrency debit cards have ceased working today as the company ended its relationship with a debit card provider called WaveCrest. Affected cards are those issued by WaveCrest, including products from CryptoPay, Bitwala, TenX, Wirex and others. The move, which first appeared to be cryptocurrency related, is in fact simply a crackdown against the WaveCrest company, who has apparently violated Visa���s policies. A Visa representative has told TNW: "We can confirm that WaveCrest���s Visa membership is being terminated due to continued non-compliance with our operating rules. All of WaveCrest���s Visa card programmes will be closed as a result. Visa has other approved card programmes that use fiat funds converted from cryptocurrency in a number of jurisdictions. The termination of WaveCrest���s Visa membership does not affect these other products.��� The news first broke via Twitter, with a number of companies linked to WaveCrest making public apologies. We have published more information about the recent Wave Crest decision that affects Bitwala prepaid cards https://t.co/wHMMNvq9Je pic.twitter.com/DjQlKQtMJe Unfortunately, our card issuer instructed us to cease all Cryptopay prepaid cards starting January 5th, 2018. All funds stored on cards are safe and will be returned to your Cryptopay accounts ASAP. Sorry for all the inconvenience caused, we���re working on the solution! The general increase in attention from regulators has led to growing fear over a cryptocurrency crackdown. However, the current problem is specifically related to issues with WaveCrest. Other companies and card issues have been unaffected.	0
The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached a new all-time high today over $700 bln. The overall market cap was around $713 bln at press time. The previous record high for overall market cap was $654 bln on Dec. 21, 2017.  The major growth in overall market cap has largely been spurred on by recent rises in altcoins. The demand for Bitcoin (BTC) has been waning recently, moving prices lower in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Bitcoin dropped as low as $11,833 on December 22. The leading cryptocurrency rallied back up just a day later, but was followed by a week of volatility. Yesterday, however, the coin got a boost after news that Peter Thiel���s San Francisco-based venture capital firm had made substantial investments in the leading cryptocurrency, propelling prices back up over the $15,000 mark. Overall dominance of Bitcoin among all cryptocurrencies has decreased to all time lows, reaching 34.97 percent on Tuesday.  This dominance shift has followed massive price increases by altcoins such as Ripple, Ether, and Stellar, as well as lesser-known Tron, all of which have posted more than 20 percent gains over the past week.  Ripple in particular has seen a huge market cap growth, with the cryptocurrency moving into second position behind the dominant Bitcoin. The increase in value was largely the result of increased demand on the South Korean market.	2
Japan has once again become the largest Bitcoin exchange market with 50.75 percent market share of the global Bitcoin exchange market. Analysts including BitFury Vice Chairman George Kikvadze attributed the surge in the trading volume of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market to the exit of Bitcoin traders in China. Earlier this week, the Chinese government, local authorities and financial regulators officially requested Chinese Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms to halt their services by the end of September. OKCoin and Huobi, the two largest exchanges in China, were granted leeway to operate until Oct. 30, considering the fact that they have not been involved in any initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the past. But, it seems as if traders are not willing to take any chances with the Chinese government and their unpredictable nature. The Chinese Bitcoin exchange market���s daily trading volume has halved within a period of three days, from 15 percent to less than seven percent. According to various trusted Bitcoin market data providers such as CryptoCompare, China only accounts for 6.4 percent of global Bitcoin trades at the time of reporting. CryptoCompare shows that Japan accounts for over 50% of all #bitcoin trades. Chinese traders have already moved to Japan. China less than 7% pic.twitter.com/t7YRaL5jv3 Prior to the nationwide Bitcoin exchange ban by China, the US exchange market had consistently secured its position as the largest market in the world. However, almost immediately after the announcement of the country���s three largest Bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, were released, traders moved over to the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market. The abrupt migration of traders led to the short-term surge in the trading volume of Japan, allowing the market to overtake the US by over 20 percent in global Bitcoin exchange market share. Contrary to many negative reports, prominent developers, analysts, researchers and experts within the cryptocurrency and Blockchain sectors including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and billionaire investor Tim Draper expressed their optimism toward the shutdown of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market. Lee emphasized that the Chinese government will no longer be able to manipulate the market, as it had done since 2013. Lee says: ���This is a good thing. China can no longer play with the markets by banning Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency cannot be killed by any country. One solution to centralized exchanges is decentralized ones. I hear the Decred Project team has something cooking that helps with that.��� As Lee emphasized, the exit of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market should really only have affected around 10 to 15 percent of traders in the global Bitcoin exchange market. Yet, speculators and impatient traders initiated a major sell-off as the Chinese government banned exchanges, leading to a major correction on Bitcoin price. Over the next few weeks, the global Bitcoin exchange market will stabilize, as traders move from the Chinese market to South Korea and Japan, two markets that have developed significantly more efficient regulations, industry standards and policies for both cryptocurrency exchanges and users. It is likely that as Lee and Draper noted, the closure of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market could lead to the stabilization of the global Bitcoin exchange market, which may be beneficial for Bitcoin in the long run.	2
A fresh new Bitcoin fork successfully debuted Friday, but its 4.2 bln coins are already raising questions. Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), which launched at block 495866, aims to switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake after mining is completed - after just 10,000 blocks. A curiously complex introduction on Bitcointalk Nov. 22 paved the way for Bitcoin���s latest doppelganger, which unlike previous incarnations Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG) has hardly anything in common with Bitcoin (BTC) at all. $BCD BORN !!! At Nov.24 GMT 9:20am !!!  Bitcoin Diamond ($BCD) successfully forked at block height 495866 and 28 global exchanges launched !! pic.twitter.com/6dpjLhmZeX Despite claiming a 28-exchange support figure, however, little is known about what BCD aims to achieve. An anonymous developer team, along with an anonymous ���Bitcoin Diamond Foundation,��� appears to be in charge of the groundwork, yet user queries about accessing coins yield a standardized response. Those wishing to unlock their BCD balances should ask wallet providers themselves, developers suggest, apparently hoping combined pressure will force the Bitcoin ecosystem to adapt to yet another hard fork. pic.twitter.com/koIIkQ2XY6 That process is slowly occurring with Bitcoin Gold, the previous fork of the network which is nonetheless gaining momentum on markets. Data from Coinmarketcap shows all-time highs of $526 could well be surpassed if current enthusiasm remains. Over the past 24 hours, BTG has gained more than 40 percent.	1
DOGE is set to make its pop culture debut.  As a weeklong pump carries the meme cryptocurrency up 12% on the daily to $.33 and a staggering 43.8% higher on a 7-day basis, some are now speculating the rally could be fueled perhaps in part by a social media tease from billionaire Elon Musk that he���ll be participating in a Saturday Night Live sketch titled ���The Dogefather.���  The DogefatherSNL May 8 Musk���s fascination with the digital currency dates back to last year, and he has recently only seemed to double-down on what may be an elaborate social media prank. While one of his companies, electric carmaker Tesla, added BTC to the balance sheet last year, the entrepreneur still seems to approach crypto generally with a touch of befuddlement ��� admitting that blockchain could be the future of human commerce, while also poking fun at its absurdities.  ���What would be the most ironic outcome? That the currency that was invented as a joke in fact becomes a real currency,��� he said of Doge in an interview in February.  Elon Musk talks about $DOGE Coin(Released 4 Hours Ago)@elonmusk said "There is a good chance that #Crypto is the future currency of Earth ... but which one is it going to be?" #Doge #DogeCoin #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency #cryptocurrencies #DOge pic.twitter.com/HDaf5jw3Xx The market, however, takes his possibly tongue-in-cheek Tweets very seriously. While the correlation may be loose and complex, multiple studies have demonstrated that Musk tweeting about the currency tends to drive it higher.  In January, the Blockchain Research Lab published a paper, ���How Elon Musk���s Twitter activity moves cryptocurrency market,��� that found six instances of Musk���s social media activity propelling DOGE higher.  Likewise, an analysis from Protos found that four of his tweets had a double-digit percentile impact on DOGE���s price (his tweets about Bitcoin and Ethereum may also move those markets, but DOGE���s lower marketcap makes it easier to pump). DOGE is notably susceptible to buzz, with social media volume ��� especially positive sentiment social media volume during American daytime hours ��� consistently driving the currency higher.  Whether or not a sketch on Saturday Night Live will have a similar effect remains to be seen. The show played a music-heavy explainer on nonfungible tokens in March, though NFT prices may have retreated in a ���silent crash��� since then.	1
In a post today on their governance and research forums, the team behind decentralized finance (DeFi) DEX protocol 0x announced initial plans to decentralize their governance by creating a ���community-owned treasury seed-funded by 0x Labs.��� ���As we continue our mission to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely, 0x Labs intends to experiment with seed-funding a community treasury managed by a DAO,��� reads the post. ���To establish the DAO, 0x Labs will identify a set of bootstrap delegates that will shepherd the initial steps of governance decentralization.��� According to Theo Gonella, platform product manager at 0x Labs and the author of the ���Introducing the 0x DAO��� post, longtime community members shouldn���t be surprised by the move to initiate decentralization.  ���We originally shared our vision around the protocol's progressive decentralization in 2017, when we introduced ZRX, 0x's governance token,��� he said. ���We have always envisioned that ZRX holders would one day be in full control of all aspects of the project - from managing the Community Treasury to driving protocol upgrades.��� The move comes during an especially productive period for the project. A v4 update to their mainnet led to a rally in price for the native ZRX token last month, and last week 0x Labs closed a $15 million fundraising round led by Pantera Capital. ZRX currently sits at $1.81, up over 300% on the month.  Governance isn���t taking a backseat to protocol development, however, as Gonella says fully open governance could be in place ���by the end of the year.��� ���Managing a community treasury is the natural first step. It will enable ZRX holders to get familiar with the governance system and fully experiment while still having some safe boundaries in place,��� he said. ���The next step is to expand the system���s reach to all aspects of the protocol, including upgrades that have just been made easier with the recent 0x v4 launch.��� In moving to establish a DAO structure, 0x joins an industry-wide effort towards decentralized governance. Rival aggregator and AMM 1inch transitioned to DAO governance late last year, and today announced a second round of airdropped governance tokens in a novel vampire attack on Uniswap. Likewise, Balancer Labs recently opened up discussion on the AMM���s V2 yield farming plans to the community, part of a larger effort to better decentralize their governance through governance token distribution.  Gonella says that this was of community ownership overtaking DeFi is an exciting one:	1
The combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies hit $800 bln on Sunday, just days after reaching the previous all-time high of $700 bln. The number is at over $825 bln as of press time and keeps growing.  Following a two-day period of sharp decline just before the New Year, the majority of cryptocurrencies are now growing again, contributing to the rapid increase in the combined market capitalization. The latest all-time high comes just under a month after the market has achieved a total capitalization of $500 bln. This immense growth, coupled with the fact that 2017 started at a mere $18 bln combined, seems to indicate that cryptocurrency is well on its way to becoming a trillion-dollar industry. Speaking of individual coins that are driving this upward dynamic, several are of note. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is hovering at a relatively stable price range between $16,500 and $17,000, with slight growth over the past week. However, the share of its capitalization against that of the market as a whole is still at all-time lows of around 34 percent, as major competitors seem to be outpacing it.  Ethereum, for example, has surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time this Friday and keeps growing. Among the likely reasons for this dynamic is the immense level of adoption of the cryptocurrency, which seems to be higher than that of the rest of the market combined. Ripple is another major producer of growth on the market. It started skyrocketing in mid-December 2017 and has already managed to displace Ethereum as the second-highest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, making its own chairman potentially the richest person on the planet in the process. However, even if you disregard the major players, there are a lot of factors as to why the numbers are growing so fast. When even meme coins are reaching billion-dollar capitalizations, countries are issuing their own cryptocurrencies, and prominent tech CEOs like Thiel and Zuckerberg are eyeing the industry, a trillion-dollar combined market cap can easily seem a distinct possibility.	2
The creator of the Bitcoin (BTC) price model, which forecasts $288,000 for BTC/USD by 2024 will ���go dark��� if his predictions come true. Speaking on the latest edition of the Stephan Livera podcast on May 5, PlanB warned about the implications of his Bitcoin bull scenario.  Stock-to-flow���s latest incarnation, S2FX, was released last week and increased its average Bitcoin price expectations five times compared to the previous version. For PlanB, despite the obvious satisfaction of BTC/USD increasing by an order of magnitude in line with stock-to-flow, the result would not be without its problems. ���I will go dark if the model is successful because if the model is successful, it will not be a pretty picture,��� he said.  It will be nasty, it will (be) maybe war ��� people have Bitcoins, some people don���t have Bitcoin, it���ll be some countries have Bitcoins, some won���t have Bitcoins, it will be the U.S. dollar losing its reserve status, it will be geopolitical, it will be military.  Bitcoin stock-to-flow chart as of May 6, 2020. Source: PlanB/ Digitalik Contrary to what he perceives as the expectations of some, PlanB added that should the model break, he would remain a social media presence.  ���That���s not the case; I���ll stay then, because we���ll need a different model,��� he explained. Critics continue to line up to pour scorn on stock-to-flow. As Cointelegraph reported, they include Bitfinex Bitcoin whale J0E007, Vitalik Buterin and others.  PlanB has argued that those attempting to discredit the model have failed to come up with evidence or an alternative theory which is demonstrably accurate. In five days��� time, the third Bitcoin block subsidy halving ��� a key milestone in the stock-to-flow timeline to $288,000 and higher ��� will become reality.	1
The history of domain names dates back to over three decades ago when the first ever .com name, symbolics.com, was registered by a Massachusetts based computer manufacturing company, Symbolics Inc. on March 15, 1985. Ever since, the domain name marketplace has grown significantly and today some highly demanded domain names sell for millions of dollars. This year has been one to remember in the Blockchain industry with mainstream recognition and adoption beginning to accelerate. One of the sectors that is enjoying a corresponding peak in interest is the world of Blockchain and cryptocurrency domain names. Be it for marketing and advertising, brand recognition for a technology, or simply to promote a new product or service, quality Blockchain and cryptocurrency domain names are a hot asset. While many new investors entering into the industry are focusing on their initial cryptocurrency purchases, there is a digital gold rush taking place with high quality Blockchain domain names.  The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) auctioning of decentralized domain names has been a huge, hit with millions of dollars worth of sales having taken place.  While usage and overall popularity of .ETH or other decentralized domain names is minimal, the trend is likely be continue in growth. Continuing the theme with ETH, the Ethereum.com domain name has recently been up for sale for close to $10 mln. Several months ago the ETH.com domain name was purchased by a well known domain name investor, Sharjil Saleem, for $2 mln. Perhaps the most impressive of the recent domain offerings is not a single name but a group of them.  President of Blockchain TV, Jason Cassidy, has assembled over 500+ of the best Blockchain domain names for sale. The portfolio is being put on the market for the first time with a price tag of $6 mln If somebody buys the group, it could go down as the biggest ever single sale in the domain name industry, thanks to Blockchain technology and its associated opportunities. With all of the interest and sales taking place for cryptocurrency and Blockchain domain names in 2017, the table looks to be set for an explosive 2018 and onward.	2
Egypt���s highest official of religious law, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam, called Bitcoin trading ���unlawful��� under Sharia law, online publication Ahram reported today. In the fatwa issued Monday, Allam wrote that Bitcoin isn���t an ���acceptable interface of exchange��� and is therefore unlawful to trade. The cleric also cited Bitcoin���s potential for money laundering and pointed out that because it isn���t subject to any government���s control, Bitcoin could potentially undermine the Egyptian economy. Allam further stated that Bitcoin negatively affects ���dealers��� legal safety��� and that: "Bitcoin is forbidden in Sharia as it causes harm to individuals, groups and institutions.��� One of the grand mufti���s advisors told BBC that Bitcoin is ���used directly to fund terrorists.��� Egypt���s government is also no fan of cryptocurrencies, having called Bitcoin a ���form of deception that falls under legal liability.��� Back in February 2017, Cointelegraph spoke to several experts about Bitcoin���s status under Sharia law. Matthew Martin of Blossom Finance explained his belief that Bitcoin is halal, writing: ���As a payment network, Bitcoin is halal. In fact, Bitcoin goes beyond what more conventional closed banking networks offer. Unlike conventional bank networks which use private ledgers where there's no guarantee that the originator actually owns the underlying assets, Bitcoin guarantees with mathematical certainty that the originator of the transfer owns the underlying assets. Conventional banks operate using the principle of fractional reserve, which is prohibited in Islam.��� Matthews did agree that Bitcoin isn���t likely to be considered money under Islamic law: ������Historically, though, Islam has only recognized commodities of intrinsic value as money including things like gold (Dinar), silver (Dirham); rice, dates, wheat, barley and salt. In a strict interpretation of what qualifies as money, Bitcoin probably misses the mark.���	0
The second round of China���s state-backed monthly ratings of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects has been released, Cena News reported June 21. Dubbed the ���Global Public Chain Technology Evaluation Index,��� this latest round was announced at the Shanghai Science Hall on June 20, and ranks EOS 1st, Ethereum (ETH) 2nd, and Bitcoin (BTC) 17th, out of a total of 30 analyzed cryptocurrencies. China���s monthly ���Global Public Chain Technology Evaluation Index��� is published by the China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and is said to be compiled by ���first-rate domestic experts and scholars,��� according to the original Index press release. EOS��� top ranking is attributed to the ���outstanding technical advantages in transaction confirmation efficiency, network throughput, and transaction costs��� of the protocol. While conceding the EOS Mainnet���s recent mishaps ��� since going live June 15, the network has faced technical issues, and criticism for freezing some accounts ��� the evaluation nonetheless judges the project to be ���highly active in technological innovation,��� a ���new generation public blockchain��� that is ���currently most regarded by the industry.��� The Index has been portrayed as a monthly ���independent analysis,��� which evaluates global blockchain projects on the basis of their technological capability, usefulness and innovation. It was first announced in May to compensate for what the Chinese government considers to be the ���lack of completely independent assessment��� for crypto and blockchain projects. As an in-depth Cointelegraph report earlier this month outlined, China has been putting its weight behind blockchain technology even as it pursues a severe line against cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). CCID has said that the new monthly Index demonstrates ���the confidence of the Chinese government��� in blockchain, and will serve as a ���guide��� for the country���s technological vanguard. Last month, an initiative backed by the country���s IT Ministry resulted in the formation of a specialist committee dedicated to cementing ���nationwide���  blockchain standards by the end of 2019. In the most recent high-profile case, China���s President Xi Jinping included blockchain as an example of a ���new generation��� of technologies that are accelerating ���breakthroughs��� in ���reconstructing the global innovation map and reshaping the global economic structure.���	2
A new report issued by audit and consulting firm Deloitte has found that blockchain technology will become a critical asset to the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. The report analyzed over 50 potential blockchain use cases and suggests that the ���potential impact��� of the nascent technology ���is huge.��� According to the report ���New Tech On The Block���, blockchain will become ���a standard operational technology across the financial, manufacturing and consumer industries,��� saying that the next five years will be ���a tipping point��� as businesses begin to grasp blockchain���s potential. The report emphasizes that businesses should assess whether their strategic objectives warrant blockchain investment, adding that those who do not at least consider the possibilities are ���at risk of falling behind.��� The report tackles the rationale for blockchain across three main areas - consumer, supply chains, and payments and contracts - scoring each in terms of the added-value that blockchain systems could create. Although it focuses on business adoption, the report nonetheless highlights that: ���The ultimate beneficiary will be the consumer. If blockchain can create efficiencies and save costs throughout the supply���chain, these benefits can be passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices. If blockchain provides more transparency across the supply���chain, these benefits can also be passed onto the consumer in the form of safer products and higher quality.���        The report cites figures from market research firm Gartner that estimates that blockchain���s business value���add will grow to $176 bln by 2025 and exceed $3.1 trln by 2030. Focusing on the retail and CPG supply-chains, Deloitte argues that the technology can resolve the four so-called major ���pain points��� of the industry, these being traceability, compliance, stakeholder management, and flexibility. The report suggests that as an auditable, immutable, and disintermediated system, with smart contract operability to boot, blockchain can effectively address all of these areas. Earlier this month, the CEO of delivery services multinational FedEx gave a speech in which he affirmed that blockchain is ���the next frontier that���s going to completely change worldwide supply chains.���   The world���s second largest software company Oracle announced this month it would be offering blockchain products, including those suited for supply chain management for pharmaceutical companies. In April, electronics giant Samsung revealed it intends to use blockchain in managing its global supply chain.	2
Cameron Winklevoss, the billionaire founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, believes the next Bitcoin (BTC) bull run will be much different. When compared to previous bull markets, Winklevoss noted that there is substantially more capital, infrastructure, and better projects. Winklevoss said: ���The next Bitcoin bull run will be dramatically different. Today, there���s exponentially more capital, human capital, infrastructure, and high-quality projects than in 2017. Not to mention the very real specter of inflation that all fiat regimes face going forward. Buckle up!��� Various data points hint at a significant increase in the amount of capital held by investors in the cryptocurrency market. Major cryptocurrency exchanges have also received more regulatory clarity, improving the infrastructure of the market. Two metrics primarily show that more money could be involved in the latest Bitcoin rally. First, the market capitalization of Tether (USDT) has surpassed $10 billion. Second, the assets under management (AUM) by Grayscale Investments recently achieved a new high.  Tether (USDT) market capitalization hits $10 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap To date, Tether is the biggest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. Investors, especially in countries with regulatory uncertainty, rely on the stablecoin to trade crypto assets. A rapid rise in the market cap of Tether could indicate more money is waiting to deploy on crypto exchanges. Grayscale���s crypto-asset trusts are arguably the most widely-utilized investment vehicles by institutions to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. Within the last quarter, the assets under management in Grayscale���s suite of products hit an all-time high at $5.1 billion.   Grayscale AUM reached $5.1 billion. Source: Grayscale Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert said: ���In 2013, everybody thought we were crazy for launching a Bitcoin investment fund. Well, look at us now������ The confluence of Tether���s market cap and Grayscale���s ballooning assets under management shows that capital held by institutions and retail traders continues to increase substantially. In 2020, exchanges and banks in the U.S. primarily saw regulatory clarity regarding cryptocurrencies.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. (OCC) allows banks to provide and operate crypto custodial solutions. It is essentially a green light for financial institutions in the U.S. to get involved in the cryptocurrency market. JPMorgan is also reported to have accepted Gemini and Coinbase, two of the largest spot exchanges in the U.S., as clients. Through this, the fear of strained banking relationships affecting exchanges and users has subsided. Clarity around cryptocurrencies by major U.S. regulators and banks could improve the perception of the asset class by the mainstream. This means if Bitcoin approaches a new bull market, the improved sentiment around the entire industry could benefit BTC adoption and its value. Overall, projects and companies in both the Bitcoin and crypto markets are seemingly increasing in quality. This is partially due to increased regulatory clarity and the fact that more traditional firms are willing to collaborate with crypto firms.  As an example, Bitcoin Lightning startup Zap is working with Visa and has participated in its Fintech Fast Track Program. This allows Zap to launch Visa cards as a part of the partnership.  Zap CEO Jack Mallers said: ���We're contractually obligated to launch one in the next 12 months and we plan on launching one in the next few months.��� Better projects, increased capital, and improving infrastructure are resulting in boosted confidence levels among Bitcoin investors and this is raising sentiment across the entire sector. In the medium-term, high-profile investors are hopeful BTC would reflect these factors. Also, don���t miss our upcoming conference Cointelegraph Crypto Traders Live.  More than 30 star speakers including Raoul Pal, John Bollinger, Mike Novogratz, DataDash and Jon Najarian will gather on July 30th to discuss the challenges of crypto trading.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined his vision for a ���plausible roadmap��� for Eth2, presenting a future where the largest smart-contract platform can increase its scalability while meeting high standards for trustlessness and censorship resistance.  In a Monday post titled ���Endgame,��� Buterin presented a thought experiment for how the average big blockchain ��� defined by very high block frequency, high block size and thousands of transactions per second ��� can still be considered sufficiently trustless and censorship-resistant. The obvious trade-off for this level of scalability is the centralization of block production. Buterin���s solutions, as presented in the blog post, do not address the centralization issue, but still provide a roadmap for implementation.  With respect to the solutions, Buterin suggested ���a second tier of staking, with low resource requirements,��� to carry out distributed block validation; ���introduce either fraud-proof or ZK-SNARKS to let users directly (and cheaply) check block validity;��� and ���introduce data availability sampling to let users check block availability [and] add secondary transaction channels to prevent censorship.��� With these updates, ���We get a chain where block production is still centralized, but block validation is trustless and highly decentralized, and specialized anti-censorship magic prevents the block producers from censoring,��� Buterin explained.  Buterin said block production would remain centralized even with the implementation of so-called ���rollups,��� which are layer-two solutions that execute transactions outside of the main Ethereum chain. (Interestingly, Buterin presented a rollup-centric roadmap for Ethereum in October 2020).  ���No single rollup succeeds at holding anywhere close to the majority of Ethereum activity. Instead, they all top out at a few hundred transactions per second,��� he said. While it may appear that rollups could contribute to distributed block production, decentralization may not last because of the possibility of cross-domain maximal extractable revenue, or MEV. As the name implies MEV refers to the maximum amount of value that can be earned from block production in excess of standard block rewards and gas fees.  The Ethereum co-founder concluded that there���s a high probability that block production will end up centralized regardless of the path to scalability that the network takes. The benefit of Ethereum���s rollup-centric roadmap is that it���s open to all futures, he said.  Eth2 isn���t going to solve all of society���s challenges, but its design is well suited to empower people to solve them together, argues @ViktorBunin https://t.co/JhBvyVjr49 Excitement surrounding Ethereum has been building since November 2020 when the protocol first embarked on its long transition to proof-of-stake. The highly anticipated London hard fork, which puts ETH on track to become a deflationary asset, was implemented in August of this year. The hard fork introduced EIP-1559, which aims to reform the network���s fee market. As Cointelegraph reported, over 1 million ETH has already been burned since the EIP-1559 came into effect.	1
19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the most important conference in China this year, ended on Oct. 24. With the end of the conference, some temporary regulations and policies are canceled as well. Among the regulations, the shutdown of Bitcoin trading in China might be one. On Oct. 28 ZB.com, which is a new cryptocurrency trading platform, announced that all trading functionality will be available from Nov. 1. Users can sign up for accounts and deposit now. The platform claims that people all over the world, including those in mainland China, can exchange and trade on the platform. The languages of the website are Chinese and English. However, it���s too soon to state that the regulation toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is invalid. Maybe the platform will be closed by the government soon. Nevertheless, there are also people saying that the Chinese government is behind the platform. For now, nobody knows exactly what���s going to happen after Nov. 1. It's good news if Chinese Bitcoin traders may operate more easily. Since the shutdown of Bitcoin trading platforms in China, people have started to trade Bitcoin through Taobao, which is the Chinese version of eBay which belongs to Alibaba Group, Wechat chatting group, and QQ chatting group. Offline trades have become popular between Chinese Bitcoin traders.	2
Major digital asset financial services firm BitGo is expanding its global reach by setting up two new regulated custodial entities in Europe. BitGo, a United States-based firm that claims to process over 20% of all Bitcoin (BTC) transactions, has established new custodial subsidiaries in Switzerland and Germany, the company announced Feb. 10. As the two new entities are regulated by different financial authorities, BitGo intends to allow its clients to choose the jurisdiction that is best suited to their business. As such, BitGo GmbH, the Swiss entity of BitGo, is a member of the country���s major self-regulatory organization, the Financial Services Standards Association, which is overseen by the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA. BitGo���s German subsidiary, BitGo Deutschland GmbH, is now providing custody services in Germany and is set to apply for regulatory approval in November 2020.  Mike Belshe, CEO at BitGo, noted that the launch of new custodial entities in Europe follows increased demand for the services in the region in 2019.  Founded in 2013 in Palo Alto, California, BitGo initially emerged as a major platform for storing Bitcoin online. In 2018, BitGo became a qualified custodian for cryptocurrencies after the firm received a state trust company charter from the South Dakota Division of Banking. To date, BitGo reportedly supports more than 250 coins and tokens with customers spanning over 50 countries, the firm said in the announcement. Belshe also pointed out that Switzerland and Germany have become some of the most friendly jurisdictions for crypto business: ���Switzerland and Germany have both become important European centers for digital assets as well as for forward-thinking regulatory frameworks. Regulatory compliance is a prerequisite for our clients, and we have been impressed with the understanding and support of Swiss and German regulators.��� Indeed, Germany is reportedly considering a bill that could enable banks to support the sale and custody of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by 2020. Meanwhile, Julius Baer, a major Swiss private banking and wealth management group, launched a digital asset trading and custodial service on Jan. 21. However, the local crypto ecosystem in the country is still being extensively monitored by regulators, with FINMA recently passing a law that would reduce the threshold for unidentified crypto exchange transactions from around $5,100 to $1,020.	2
After a crippling market downturn that may be picking up steam this weekend, in a tweet this morning, Elon Musk has voiced tepid support for cryptocurrencies.  The Tesla CEO, whose about-face concerning accepting Bitcoin payments for new vehicles last week was widely blamed as a catalyst for the downturn, responded to a Twitter user who asked what he thinks about ���the peeps who are angry at you because of crypto.���  In response, Musk seemed to take a long view of the situation, saying that crypto���s primary challenge isn���t short-term price action, but instead and ongoing battle against fiat:  The true battle is between fiat & crypto. On balance, I support the latter. The entrepreneur noted that he ���supports��� crypto in that battle, but only barely, noting that the decision is ���on balance.��� Musk���s tweets about cryptocurrencies have been in the spotlight since the market downturn ��� a brutal crash wiping upward of 50% off of major digital assets and sparking fears that the bull run could be over.  Musk ��� who has been shown by multiple studies to be capable of influencing Dogecoin markets with his tweets, though larger currencies by market capitalization have proven to be more resilient ��� has been giving mixed signals in regard to his support as of late and has insisted that cryptocurrencies need a way to become more environmentally friendly.  To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can���t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal His flighty and often changing opinions have been closely watched by the financial press ��� enough so that a recent survey shows that half of Australians believe Musk is the inventor of Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) was created by a developer working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.  The crypto community appears to be turning on him, however, as a petition has been circulating urging the world���s third-richest man to sell his Bitcoin along with the Bitcoin Tesla currently holds.	0
According to local news media reports, a Michigan man named Bradley Anthony Stetkiw has been charged by local authorities for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The charges have been filed in US District Court. Per the report, Stetkiw had been brokering Bitcoin transactions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars without the proper licensing required for monetary brokering. He had been using the website LocalBitcoins, and would meet his would-be clients at Tim Horton���s restaurant, going by the moniker ���SaltandPepper.��� As part of a sting operation, federal agents met the trader and purchased more than $55,000 in Bitcoin over the course of a number of meetings, with Stetkiw even brokering deals with out of state sellers. These activities are all licensed by state and federal agencies. The operation highlights the reality that Bitcoin is still within a widespread ���adoption curve��� as the power of the decentralized currency is mitigated with the dangers of illegal activities. Governments, while embracing the potential for growth, nevertheless continue to express concern over the risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.	0
Enel, one of Europe���s largest power utility companies, announced today, Feb. 1, that they would not be selling renewable energy to crypto mining company Envion. In a brief statement to Reuters, the Italy-based company said that they had ���no interest whatsoever in selling power��� to a mining company: ���Enel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonisation and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing.��� Enel had reportedly been in talks for a deal with the Swiss-based Envion AG, an off-grid mining company that claims to use decentralized, clean energy to power its mobile mining units, prior to today���s decision not to sell. Each Envion unit is installed inside of a shipping container and can be powered by a solar or wind farm anywhere in the world, eliminating a reliance on any one country���s infrastructure. Almost 70 percent of the world���s cryptocurrency mining takes place not in Europe, but in China, due to the cheap electrical costs there. However, as China has recently been tightening up regulations on crypto trading in the country, banning ICOs and exchanges, there is concern that miners could face power restrictions in China. As CT reported in December 2017, standard Bitcoin mining globally uses more power than most African countries. With crypto mining in China based on either the use of coal or hydroelectric power, companies have tried innovative ways to use more renewable forms of energy, like a Netherlands-based company that tried to harness human body heat for mining purposes.	0
The withdrawal of funds from stocks and precious metals has coincided with the massive price increase of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It seems that investors have realized that Bitcoin is a more stable ���store of value��� investment than gold. CNBC has reported that the stock market has seen the largest withdrawal rate since 2004, with more than $30 bln being taken out of the markets over the past 10 weeks. The major withdrawal also included a huge abandoning of precious metals. Private client allocation to precious metals has seen a massive reduction, with portfolios holding 10 percent in 2013 being reduced to below two percent in recent weeks.  (source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, EPFR Global) The precious metals investment decline has coincided with a removal of funds from the stock market overall, with investors choosing to pull back from the market, though the market continues to post gains. Concerns about current market levels and monetization policies may be fueling to flight. Blockchain technology is producing new investment opportunities. Companies like LAToken and MyBit have developed methods for tokenizing investments, making it possible for large-scale investments to be purchased by smaller scale investors. The decentralized platform of these companies makes it possible for investors to participate without the higher fees associated with traditional markets. LAToken has even produced a system where shares of Apple, Amazon and other blue chip stocks can be ���tokenized��� and purchased in part by investors. CEO of LA Token Valentin Preobrazhenskiy says: ���We build a NASDAQ on Blockchain with a wider range of tradable assets, blurring the boundaries between crypto- and real economies, and offering our clients a dramatic reduction of listing costs, settlement time, and transaction costs.��� Whether the tokenized asset market is viable or not remains to be seen, but the flight of investors from stocks and precious metals has pressed the need for new and innovative vehicles for investors.	2
Is it truly possible to harness energy from the human body to power cryptocurrency mining rigs? A Netherlands-based technology company, Speculative.Capital has pioneered a project that explores the possibility of harnessing energy from idle human subjects. To do so, the company created body suits that turn body heat into electricity from human subjects to power computers that are mining cryptocurrency. According to their website, 37 people were involved in the project. The concept is pretty simple, a subject lies down for a few hours while the body suit harnesses energy from their body heat. The technology is pretty nifty, as small thermoelectric generators harvest the temperature differential between the subject���s body temperature and the surrounding ambient temperature of the room. The electricity generated is then used to power mining rigs, that mined recently created cryptocurrencies that promised to create good future growth in value. In total, the subjects provided enough power for the computers to mine for 212 hours, that���s just over eight days, and they claim to have unlocked 16,594 coins during that time. The chosen cryptocurrencies were Vertcoin, StartCOIN, Dash, Lisk, Litecoin and Ethereum. Vertcoin and StartCOIN accounted for the majority of coins unlocked, while comparative crypto heavyweights Litecoin and Ethereum were the least mined coins - given the now-scaled difficulty to mine them. During that 212 hour period, the 37 subjects produced 127,210 milliwatts of power. If you have a Nvidia 1060 six GB graphics card in your computer, you can expect to get a hashrate of 19 MH/s at 80 watts when mining Ethereum - going with data from 1stminingrig.com. Going with CryptoCompare���s current calculations - you would only be able to mine 0.002487 of Ethereum a day and that is using all 127,210 milliwatts, which equals 127 watts, of the power harnessed by the bodysuits. While the idea is admirable, quirky and exciting, it seems like far too much effort for too little reward. However, projects such as these push the boundaries of technology and expand the limits of what the human body is capable of, and how we view and explore the way we harness and produce energy in the future. Whenever projects like these are undertaken and results are published, people are quick to debunk and belittle the work that has been done. While the project may not have produced nearly enough energy to mine extraordinary amounts of cryptocurrency, it is an alternative and green way of looking to power the miners needed to maintain the Blockchain.  Speculative.Capital does make one wonder what other alternatives there are to power up mining rigs - especially for hobby miners at home. The easiest, and probably most accessible option is solar power - if you live somewhere sunny. Solar panels are easy to obtain and setup, although you will need an inverter and batteries to store their power. But given a steady a supply of sunlight, and you could easily produce enough energy to power a home-built mining rig. Going by these calculations on solarpowerrocks.com, an average solar panel will produce 250 watts in an hour. If you get four hours of full sun, your panel will generate 1,000 watts of energy - eight times as much produced by our friends in the Netherlands. At the end of the day, the efficiency of their chosen method matters not. What is imperative is that we look for cheaper and cleaner energy sources to power the power-hungry mining industry that continually verifies the Blockchain of cryptocurrencies. As it stands, the cumulative power consumption of mining operations worldwide use more power than a number of individual African countries, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies promise decentralized and anonymous transactional services to the common man - but we need to be conscious of the effect it has on power grids worldwide. If we can find better solutions - we should be using them. The likes of Speculative.Capital and other technology companies are blazing a new trail for the cryptocurrency space, and it will be a massive triumph if more miners look to alternative power sources in the future. At the time of publishing, Cointelegraph had not received a reply for an interview from Speculative.Capital.	1
According to JoongAng, South Korea���s largest mainstream media outlet, investors in the local cryptocurrency exchange market are outraged over Bitcoin Platinum, an alleged scam created by a South Korean teenager. The Twitter handle @bitcoinplatinum, the official account of the Bitcoin Platinum project has advertised the project, as a hard fork of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Earlier this month, the creator of Bitcoin Platinum claimed that a group of miners, developers, investors and Bitcoin users will hard fork the Bitcoin protocol at block 498,577. However, the Twitter account has not provided the public with any information about supporters, developers, investors and/or miners. Even before this most recent incident that set off the South Korean Bitcoin community, investors remained highly skeptical of the project given its vague description and vision. Bitcoin Platinum claimed to achieve ���Satoshi���s original vision of Bitcoin as decentralized electronic cash,��� copying the vision of Bitcoin Cash. Adding to the skepticism, the Bitcoin Platinum account has not offered any additional information apart from PR gibberish. One statement from Bitcoin Platinum read: ���Bitcoin Platinum brings true Blockchain ledger to the world. Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation and decentralized development.��� Earlier today, on Dec. 10, after releasing all of the statements in English since the first week of November, the Bitcoin Platinum Twitter account holder wrote in Korean:  The brief statements above, written with a highly informal tone, read: ���[Bitcoin] shorting very good,��� and ���so who told you to buy Bitcoin, shorting [Bitcoin] is the best.��� Based on the tweets released by Bitcoin Platinum, the motivation behind the Bitcoin Platinum project evidently was to try to decrease the price of Bitcoin by introducing a hard fork and profit off the short-term price trend of Bitcoin by shorting it. JoongAng and other South Korean mainstream media outlets revealed that the administrator of the Bitcoin Platinum Twitter account and the creator of the project, which is now suspected be a scam, is a South Korean teenager, who allegedly introduced the project to find an opportunity to short Bitcoin in the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market. The teenager then admitted on Twitter from the Bitcoin Platinum account that the project was created as a scam. The Bitcoin Platinum creator wrote: ���Please forgive me. Bitcoin Platinum is a scam coin. I created the project to earn five mln Korean won ($4,590).���  Last month, a $200 mln Ponzi scheme was unraveled, which targeted middle-aged investors. The operators of the Ponzi scheme established a Bitcoin consultancy firm in Seoul, lured in investors in the market, and offered unrealistic profit margins, claiming that their money would be invested in Bitcoin. Ultimately, the five individuals behind the Ponzi scheme were arrested, as investors requested a local police department to investigate into the scam many months after they did not receive any payouts from the operators. In the upcoming months, the South Korean government and its cryptocurrency task force formed by five ministries and commissions, including the ministry of strategy and finance, will create policies to regulate the South Korean cryptocurrency market. The upcoming regulation is an effort to crackdown on scams and fraudulent operations, such as the $200 mln Ponzi scheme mentioned above and, most recently, Bitcoin Platinum.	0
The Chinese actions of banning ICOs and shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges may be with the intention of preventing ordinary Chinese citizens from incurring financial losses. They should, however, be wary of the Cobra Effect. There is an interesting anecdote about the British rule of India. Worried about the large number of venomous cobras in the Indian city of Delhi, the British government had a brilliant idea: they offered a reward for every dead cobra. While this initially resulted in people killing cobras to claim the reward, it soon resulted in unforeseen problems for the British. People began to breed cobras to claim the reward. When the British realized this, they scrapped the reward program. The people then released the worthless snakes, resulting in an increase in the cobra population. The efforts taken by the British to solve the cobra problem had actually exacerbated the situation. Ceteris Paribus (Latin for all other things remaining unchanged) is a key underlying assumption when people debate solutions to problems. If they fail to consider the side effects or secondary effects of the solution that they propose, they could be in for surprises. The British thought offering a reward for dead cobras would result in people killing cobras and the cobra population decreasing. Similarly, since most cryptocurrency trades take place at exchanges, the Chinese government may have thought shutting down exchanges will decrease the number of people investing in cryptocurrencies. They might just be in for a surprise. What could be the motivation behind the Chinese government's actions of banning ICOs and shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges? One reason could be that the Chinese government would like to make it more difficult for ordinary citizens to buy cryptocurrencies and therefore make it less popular. While there has been a temporary blip in trading volumes, resulting in Bitcoin trading it a discount, it is difficult to say how long it will last. Another reason might be that the Chinese government would like to 'protect' the retail investor by making it difficult for him to buy Bitcoins. However, the decision to shut down cryptocurrency exchanges will likely just drive people who want to buy Bitcoins to enter into PTP trades. These are far riskier than buying Bitcoins through exchanges, with a high risk of fraud. The Chinese are, right now, creating their own version of the Cobra Effect!	0
Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and entrepreneur known for founding and leading Tesla Motors and SpaceX, revealed on Twitter Thursday Feb. 22, how much Bitcoin (BTC) he owns ��� 0.25 BTC or about $2,478 as of press time, or 0.000012% of his total net worth. Musk���s cryptocurrency holdings reveal comes after a number of fake accounts posing to be various well-known figures, including Musk, cropped up on Twitter promising crypto donations to those who send them crypto. On Feb. 22 a Twitter user concerned about the scam accounts asked Musk in a tweet "why is all the spam popping up lately?" Not sure. I let @jack know, but it���s still going. I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago. Musk responded that he had already reported the issue to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to no avail. Evidently as a way of explaining his surprise at the multiple scams, Musk noted in the same tweet that apart from the 0.25 BTC a friend had given to him ���many years ago���, he "literally own[s] zero cryptocurrency." The Bitcoin sum he reports to own is indeed an extremely small fraction of Musk���s total net worth, which stands at $21.4 billion as of Feb. 24. In November 2017, Musk denied rumors suggested by former SpaceX intern Sahil Gupta that Musk was probably Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary anonymous creator of Bitcoin. As Cointelegraph reported Feb. 21, a cloud security firm recently reported that Tesla���s non-password protected Amazon Web Service���s (AWS) software container had been hacked to mine cryptocurrency over an as yet unknown period of time.	0
BlockShow, a major international blockchain event powered by Cointelegraph, announced the new conference BlockShow Americas 2018, which will be held in Las Vegas August 20-21, 2018. The event comes on the heels of the successful BlockShow Europe 2018 in Germany in May 2018. According to the BlockShow team, the upcoming conference will be focused on the crucial questions that affect the blockchain community ��� governmental initiatives, insights from central banks, and the evolution of law and regulations. BlockShow Americas will be held at the premises of the Venetian and the Palazzo, the famous hotels of Las Vegas, which recreate the atmosphere of old Venice. According to the BlockShow team, it perfectly compliments the visual concept of the event - the famous Carnival of Venice. More than 80 international speakers ��� from fintech, blockchain and cryptocurrency ��� are expected at the event. The list of speakers include Alex Mashinsky, founder of the Celsius Network, a serial entrepreneur and venture investor; Mike Butcher, editor at large at TechCrunch ��� awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2016; Dr. Nouriel Roubini, Co-founder & former chairman of Roubini Global Economics, ex-senior economist for international affairs at the White House Council of Economic Advisors; David Schwartz, CTO at Ripple; Johanna Maska, CEO of Global Situation Room and former White House Director of Press Advance (for President Barack Obama); and other well-known personalities. BlockShow Americas 2018 is planned to be a platform for companies in the blockchain and allied space to show off their latest and greatest products, releases and projects. The companies will feature their important developments in different sectors, such as voting and elections, e-commerce, and supply chains. One of the highlights for the participants will be the BlockShow Oscar, a startup competition for young and innovative blockchain companies. In the previous editions of the contest, six companies were awarded almost $90,000 in total. A previous BlockShow Oscar winner has reportedly reached a full hard cap of $30 million and the previous participants have raised more than a combined total of $500 million. The previous BlockShow conferences had become the venue for over 7,000 private meetings and over 170 exhibitors, with more than 1000 startups presented. There have been over 1,000 media publications about BlockShow. Describing how the conference has been able to bring people together, Rachel Wolfson ��� a Forbes journalist ��� said: ���l���m really impressed with the European crypto conference scene. This conference brought a lot of people together. Coming from San Francisco, it is really refreshing to see. It is exciting.��� Bobby Lee, co-founder of BTCC and board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, told Cointelegraph about his previous experience at BlockShow, ���I really enjoyed BlockShow Europe. It was great to see a lot of enthusiasm from the attendees and the organizers did a wonderful job. It was very professionally done and everything was on schedule. I think conferences are important to get the word out there, to educate people and help them learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain. This is how we get on-board the next billion people.��� More than 100 organizations and companies ��� such as Achain, Changelly, iExec and Iconiq Lab ��� provided support for the BlockShow event in Europe. BuzzFeed quoted Addy Creeze, CEO of BlockShow as saying, ���Among conferences, BlockShow is like the Cirque du Soleil of the circus ��� we stand out from the competitors. We are not your typical conference: We remove standard, official stuff from it and focus on a casual atmosphere where community feels like home and where people can network and sign contracts. We disregard the word ���official,��� and like to replace it with ���informal.��� We are a show for blockchain business representatives to spend their time efficiently.��� Registration for BlockShow Americas 2018 is already open on the website. There is a special offer which allows to save on ticket purchase.	1
The Robinhood mobile trading app launched zero-fee Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading for the first batch of the users of its Robinhood Crypto platform on Thursday, Feb. 22, as announced on the company���s blog. The first users to get access to the commission-free platform are customers residing in the US states California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and New Hampshire. Robinhood noted that the application will be rolled out gradually with support for ���many more states��� coming ���later.��� At the moment, all users of Robinhood are able to monitor the market for the prices of 16 different cryptocurrencies, regardless of whether or not they have access to the actual trading feature. As Robinhood stated on Jan. 25, the main goal behind launching its zero-fee cryptocurrency trading platform was to bring as many new customers as possible. Robinhood claimed that the company is planning ���to operate this business on break even basics.��� According to the latest blog post, the current number of Robinhood Crypto users has reached four million with over $100 bln in transaction volume on its brokerage platform and over $1 bln in saved commissions in equity trades. Apart from the launch of cryptocurrency trading, Robinhood has also released its Robinhood Feed which allows cryptocurrency investors to discuss cryptocurrency markets, trends and news online.	2
Following a long-term bearish trend on altcoins this autumn, the cryptocurrency market was surging at the end of the last year. Altcoins as Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Verge (XVG), Cardano (ADA) skyrocketed in the course of two to three week. Many others grew in price by five to ten times with the record-setters, such as Tron (TRX) and Verge - by 20 to 30 times respectively. Many altcoins proved to be stabilizing. Major players such as Ethereum (ETH) increased immensely with a huge capitalization. It should be noted that the increase in prices has been growing alongside a relatively stable BTC price, which means that all the generated profits were nominated not only in US dollars but also in BTC. By investing a minimum of one BTC in XVG at the price of 50 Satoshi in early December, an investor could sell it at the price of 1,500 Satoshis with a 30-time return on investment within just two weeks. To make a good investment in these coins, one simply needed to register at three major cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bitfinex, Bittrex, Binance. There you can also monitor listings of new coins that could generate substantial profit as demand for them grows in the long run. Another area on the market that is less known, but no less potentially profitable, is emerging crypto assets that are not yet listed on major exchanges. And this is not surprising, as being listed on a major exchange is rather time and effort-consuming for any startup project. Hundreds of applications are received by markets every day, but cannot be accepted immediately, as new coin undergoes a check of its technical specs of a new coin and its real demand on the market. Each new coin that is to be listed would either draw back the liquidity from other traded pairs or become a dead-weight and delude the traders damaging the exchange���s reputation at the same time. Several instances of this can be observed at the hitBTC listed pairs overview. That is why a great number of really valuable up-and-coming crypto assets with good chances for growth are starting at minor exchanges, where the conditions to be listed are less strict. Here these coins are making the first sparkles and then increase in price several times more once they get to a big exchange, like Bittrex. These are assets that if managed correctly from the start could make an investor very rich. Let���s look into five new assets that, if invested in December 2017, would have generated an amazing profit for the investor and could maybe generate even more in the near future. Only assets with the trade volumes no less than $1 mln were taken into consideration. All the ���shit coins��� that are growing at pump and dump schemes were filtered. Assets that are traded at major exchanges such as Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex, Binance were not taken into consideration either. All mentioned crypto assets (or ���coins���) have been selected by the following criteria:  RaiBlocks (XRB) is a coin, built on DAG-technology along with well-known IOTA, focusing on fast microtransactions. One of the important points why this coin was picked is demand for DAG technology in industry and a broad market for future implementation. Dent (DENT) is used for sharing prepaid packages of mobile data. According to Cisco review, 15 percent of mobile data is unused and this is the market of 4.8 bln dollars. User cases are as follows: sharing unused data packages, avoid roaming, automated buying mobile data for IoT devices at best price. This concept is good for future demand on Dent token, so it was selected. IoT Chain (ITC) is a coin from a Chinese-based startup, providing high-scalable transactions for IoT industry. The project is based on a high-scalable DAG version. IoT in general is a trend in the industry and a new high-qualified project, which could present an interesting opportunity in an investment portfolio. Dragonchain (DRGN) is a new Blockchain platform, designed by Disney. The platform is high-scalable, has huge functionality and can serve many fields of operation - smart contracts, identity, intellectual property, p2p financial instruments and many others. Also, the platform is building its own ecosystem with startup incubator. At the moment Look Lateral - an Italian project selling art with Blockchain rights fixation as well as LifeID (Blockchain-based identity) are making a product using Dragonchain. According to the top-tier company behind this project and technological functionality, this asset is surely a ���little coin, going big.��� XTRABYTES (XBY) is a platform for dApps, offering high-scalability and decentralization opportunities over current Blockchain technologies. The team created a new consensus method, Proof-of-Signature and algorithm Zolt. This project seems good and new-tech oriented, so possible high-demand for XBY coin may arise if XTRABYTES solution becomes used widely. Profitability from holding these ���little coins��� was compared to buying and holding major crypto assets like ETH and XRP at the same time as demonstrated below. RaiBlocks demonstrated an enormous price growth rate, giving a 70 times increase on the investment; Dent provided 23 times capital growth. Otherwise little, but promising coins that were selected are comparable to XRP and significantly higher profit of investment in comparison to ETH. It seems that these coins with good fundament and technology were unknown in a major part of the community whose price greatly increased once discovered by investors. Besides fundamental reasons of investment, many of them probably keep in mind that after listing on major exchanges price will be rising even more, when a very large community and big money will have direct access to trade these coins.  Assets in the crypto industry grow rapidly if there is a large influx of funds coming in from new investors with simultaneous holding by earlier investors. The price increase, in this case, is due to the constantly increasing demand together with the shrinking amount in circulation. After listing on a bigger exchange, like Bittrex or Binance, the demand grows massively, which increases the price even further. For this reason, investors would monitor new coins introduced to smaller exchanges, because these assets are seriously underestimated due to the lack of audience and low trade volume. But constant monitoring can be rather tedious and requires having multiple accounts, which is time-consuming. On the other hand, potentially attractive coins don���t get a decent audience, because investors would rather prefer to purchase a new asset once it is listed on some bigger exchange. That results in a huge price increase and high volatility: massive funds are injected to the coin instantly at its purchase.  One of the current issues of the market should be facilitating the access to new assets for investors. On one hand, it will be easier for new users to start investing into crypto assets, and on the other hand, it would bring audience and liquidity to new coins.  This is possible only by means of integrating all exchanges into one technical and visual interface that would allow trading multiple cryptocurrency pairs in one terminal at single-click ease. Once deployed, this would bring about another perk for both traders and new coins: traders would be able to start buying the coin from the date it was listed at any of the exchanges that are part of this integrated network, while the coin gets a more extended and organic timeline of growth. The problem has already been tackled by several teams. One of them is B2BX that ran a successful ICO in late 2017. They plan to make the first official B2B cryptocurrency exchange aggregator or marketplace to connect institutional clients, forex/DMA and stockbrokers with cryptocurrency exchanges. So, when the B2BX product is delivered on the market, cryptocurrency exchanges could receive more liquidity. The project is targeting brokerage houses, liquidity providers and institutional investors, the majority of the traders will have access to the market via their forex or stockbrokers. Another startup that proved to be pretty successful is Arbidex ��� the platform that integrates crypto exchanges into one single interface with a built-in mechanism for automated arbitrage. The Arbidex team claims that integration of cryptocurrency exchanges together with the additional functionality as an automated arbitrage system will provide more liquidity to trading pairs and eliminate borders between exchanges. Using only one Arbidex account, a customer can buy and sell crypto assets and coins at all connected exchanges. So, new trading pairs on major exchanges like Binance or small like Livecoin automatically are in availability to trade for all Arbidex users. They even offer a breakthrough high-end trading terminal for traders, integrating orderbooks and trading pairs from multiple exchanges with an opportunity to make extra profit. The third solution can seen in the Japanese project Liquid, which is operating under Quinone Corporation, which has the exchange license from the Japanese authority. One of the project goals is to provide liquidity for the cryptocurrency exchange market and to create a worldwide order book. This year seems to be bringing more maturity to cryptocurrency exchange markets. Hopefully we will see the introduction of market brokerage platforms and services with trading tools such as professional trading terminals, analytics, and the possibility to buy and sell the majority of crypto assets in one window. What if 2018 is the year of little coins becoming big? Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Singapore's deputy prime minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam provided new commentary on the government���s commitment ���not to ban��� cryptocurrency as part of its future regulatory plans. In a series of fourteen statements published Monday, Feb. 5 in response to questions posed by members of parliament Tuesday, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, deputy prime minister and minister in charge of regulatory body the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), confirmed a broadly hands-off policy regarding cryptocurrencies going forward. ���...(MAS) has been closely studying these developments and the potential risks they pose. As of now, there is no strong case to ban cryptocurrency trading here,��� the deputy PM said. ���But we will be subjecting those involved as intermediaries to our anti-money laundering regulations. And we will keep highlighting to Singaporeans that they could lose their shirts when they invest money in cryptocurrencies.��� Like Japan, Singapore has highlighted itself as a permissive environment for both cryptocurrency and Blockchain innovation over the past few years. In stark contrast to China and Indonesia, the city-state has favored Blockchain in particular as part of its bid to become a global hub for the technology. Addressing the disparity between Singapore and its neighbors, Shanmugaratnam noted that volumes involved were comparatively small and exposure to the financial system correspondingly insignificant. ���For now, the nature and scale of cryptocurrency trading in Singapore does not pose risks to the safety and integrity of our financial system,��� he continued. ���...Further, connections between cryptocurrency trading and Singapore���s financial system are also not significant at present. Singapore���s banking system does not have any signficant (sic) exposure to global and local entities dealing in cryptocurrencies. We hence do not have broader, systemic risk concerns with regard to cryptocurrencies.��� Last month, MAS managing director Ravi Menon sounded similarly bullish on crypto���s future when he went on record to mainstream media to say he hoped assets and their underlying technology would survive a major crash.	2
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted by 14% from $10,180 to $8,600 on BitMEX within less than 15 minutes. Three major factors that caused the price drop were: long contracts accounting for the overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin market, BTC reacting to a multiyear resistance at $10,500 and whales dumping.  BTC/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView Before the price correction occurred, the funding rate for Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) hovered at around 0.16% and 0.19%, respectively. The term funding rate in the Bitcoin futures market means the fee long contract or short contract holders have to pay their counterparts to establish balance in the market. As an example, let���s say the price of Bitcoin is going up and the funding rate, which typically is at around 0.01%, rises to 0.16%. If a trader is holding a $100,000 long position, the trader has to pay $160 every eight hours to another short contract holder holding a $100,000 short position. The funding mechanism prevents the market from swaying to majority longs or shorts for an extended period of time. A signal something was amiss was the fact that prior to the price drop, Bitcoin���s funding rate was too high and around 75% of the market was holding long contracts. The majority of traders were anticipating Bitcoin's price to increase and were aggressively longing the market. Inevitably, a long squeeze occurred, liquidating about $120 million worth of long contracts.  BitMEX XBTUSD Liquidations. Source: Skew The price of BTC also fell exactly as the United States market opened. It suggests the CME Bitcoin futures market was partially behind the sell-off in BTC. Cryptocurrency investor PlanB said: ���BTC crashes -$1000 in 15 minutes on US opening (exact same time and volumes as of May 20 and May 21.��� Bitcoin has tested the $10,500 resistance level a total of three times in the past eight months. The top-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap rose to as high as $10,500 in October 2019. Within four weeks, it dropped to $6,400, bottoming out in a six-week span. In February, Bitcoin made another attempt to surpass the $10,500 resistance level. After rejecting violently to $8,400, BTC fell to as low as $3,600 in the following four weeks. This is the third time BTC has tested the same level in the last three quarters, and it is also the third time it has been met with a similar reaction. As BTC fails to reclaim the same level for three consecutive times, the question traders are asking is if BTC is ready to break out of it and initiate a proper bull trend in the coming weeks. Given the intensity of the drop and the breakdown of the short-term market structure, the probability of seeing Bitcoin testing higher resistance levels in the near term found at $11,500, $12,400 and $14,000 decreased with the recent price action.  A few hours before the drop happened, whales moved their funds to BitMEX and Binance. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said: ���Multiple significant BTC inflows from Binance and BitMEX a few hours before the dip.���  BitMEX and Binance inflows before the drop to $8,600. Source: CryptoQuant The combination of whales selling Bitcoin right at a multiyear resistance with high funding and the majority of the market being long triggered a strong long squeeze within a short period of time.	0
Bitcoin seems to be going from strength to strength, recording a new all time high of $8725 on Saturday. While this is impressive in itself, investors who held Bitcoin before August 1 are doing even better, as the combined price of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has crossed $10,000. After a relatively quiet few days, Bitcoin seems poised to resume its uptrend. The price jumped up from a low of $8,200 to cross $8,700 in under 12 hours. The rally seemed to be driven by retail investors in Asia, with the largest volume being traded on Bithumb and Bitfinex. Bitcoin seems to have shrugged off the $30 mln hacking of Tether, which some had speculated could destabilize Bitfinex and by extension Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin bulls like Ronnie Moas and Mike Novogratz who predicted that Bitcoin would reach $10K in 2017 may be proven correct shortly. The number of users of the popular exchange Coinbase has been growing in leaps and bounds in 2017. Many in the digital currency world have been monitoring the speed with which Coinbase has been adding users, since that can be taken as a measure of Bitcoin���s retail adoption. According to data compiled by Alistair Milne, of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, the number of users of Coinbase has increased from about 5 mln at the start of 2017 to 13.1 mln today. Over 100k users were added in 24 hours at the start of November, when CME announced that it would launch Bitcoin futures trading. During Thanksgiving weekend, Coinbase again crossed that mark, with another 100k users signed up in 24 hours.  Individual investors seem to be afraid of missing out on buying Bitcoin, which might become unaffordable once the institutional money starts flowing in. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash proponents may not see eye-to-eye on a scaling solution, but they share significant overlap among their user base. Most Bitcoin users, who didn't actively trade after the August hard fork, hold equal amounts of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The combined value of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has now crossed $10k. If we include the value of other forks like Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond, the value would be even higher.	2
For a long time, people debated whether Ethereum would one day overtake Bitcoin and become the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The tables have turned on Ethereum now, with Bitcoin Cash overtaking Ethereum to become the #2 cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash had a phenomenal run during the weekend, with its price increasing from $660 on Friday to a peak of $2,446 on Sunday. The price has almost quadrupled in a matter of two days. While the price seems to have been driven by Korean exchanges, other global exchanges have reported healthy gains too. At the time of reporting the price had corrected, but still bore a healthy gain. The overall market capitalization of Bitcoin Cash after the correction is still ~$31 bln, which is more than the market capitalization of Ethereum. While people had always thought of Ethereum as the major challenger to Bitcoin, it now appears that Bitcoin Cash has taken Ethereum's place. Vitalik Buterin tweeted his congratulations Congrats on this. Seriously. @rogerkver @JihanWu @deadalnix pic.twitter.com/UXYdEcRn4y The sharp rise in Bitcoin Cash's price has come at the expense of Bitcoin. Bitcoin���s price has been on a steady downtrend ever since the Segwit2X fork was cancelled. A lot of people had bought Bitcoins in the expectation that they would get free Segwit2x coins after the fork. While market observers had expected some of this hot money to flow into altcoins once the Segwit2X fork happened/got cancelled, Bitcoin Cash seems to have been the main, but not only, beneficiary. The combined price of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is over $8,000, which is not very different from the price on Friday. Apart from the dashed expectation of free Segwit2X coins, another problem plaguing Bitcoin is the huge transaction backlog. With over 135,000 unconfirmed transactions and transaction fees soaring, the Bitcoin network seems to be grinding to a halt. Segwit2X would have made a difference, but it has been abandoned. Other scalability solutions, whether the Lightning Network or others are urgently needed, but may not get implemented in the near future. In the face of these problems, Bitcoin Cash seems very attractive. People have all along been looking for a Bitcoin-killer altcoin, an altcoin with enhanced features, whose value would increase to overtake Bitcoin. In the end the solution might have been staring everybody in the face - the market may place a premium on quick confirmation and low fees, which could boost Bitcoin Cash.	1
A blockchain data platform has been selected the winner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission���s first science competition, offering yet another compelling sign that distributed ledger technology has burst onto the mainstream.  Nakamoto Terminal, a digital-asset analytics platform built by open-source intelligence company Inca Digital, has won the CFTC���s "Project Streetlamp" competition. Nakamoto Terminal was also named "Innovator of the Year" by the CFTC for its successful submission.  The Project Streetlamp competition challenged innovators to come up with an artificial intelligence solution that could help the CFTC ���automate the process of identifying and adding unregistered foreign entities��� to its Registration Deficient List. The RED List was created in 2015 to help consumers make informed decisions about whether to invest through such entities.  Since 2015, hundreds of companies have been placed on the RED List.  In an official statement, LabCFTC director and chief innovation officer Melissa Netram said: Nakamoto Terminal���s winning submission automates deep metadata searches and aggregates them to determine whether a company should be placed on the RED List. CFTC regulators already use Nakamoto Terminal���s technology for market surveillance and litigation support. Inca Digital, the company behind the platform, was founded by former INTERPOL analysts who have created natural language processors to track individuals and companies, monitor media outlets and scan global regulatory edicts.  Nakamoto Terminal was named after Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin���s (BTC) pseudonymous creator. The person or entity behind the pseudonym developed Bitcoin, authored the Bitcoin white paper and developed the first blockchain database before essentially disappearing.	1
Today, January 9, ProShares, Raffety Assets Management and VanEck all withdrew their Bitcoin-related ETF proposals from SEC consideration, at the regulator���s request. Rafferty Assets Management commented that the SEC ���expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation��� of the underlying asset.���   None of the withdrawn proposals were actually Bitcoin ETFs, per se. An actual Bitcoin ETF is widely seen as the holy grail of mainstream financial acceptance, as it would require the purchase of actual Bitcoins in order to ���back��� investments in the ETF. All of the proposals withdrawn today were related to Bitcoin futures markets. Nonetheless, the proposed ETFs had been greeted with pleasure by the Bitcoin community, which saw them as a stepping stone to a true Bitcoin ETF. Indeed, Bitcoin investors believed they had reason to be optimistic following the release of regulated Bitcoin futures markets last month. In rejecting the Winklevoss ETF proposal early last year, the SEC specifically left the door open to approving a Bitcoin ETF in the event that regulated futures markets emerged. The SEC���s unwillingness to consider ETFs based on these futures market is certainly a cause for concern. Nonetheless, it���s wise to remember that the regulatory wheel turns slowly. Chris Concannon, CEO of Cboe, told Business Insider last month: ���A healthy market is a healthy underlying market, derivatives markets, and an ETF. That will take time.���	0
The most anticipated cryptocurrency event of 2020, Bitcoin���s (BTC) third halving, has just taken effect. Occurring only once every four years, the latest Bitcoin mining block reward halving just reduced the Bitcoin block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. Bitcoin���s third halving event took place at 7:23 p.m. UTC on Monday, according to data from Tradeblock.com. Having overcome the halving, Bitcoin is trading at $8,500, with market dominance of 67% as of press time, according to Coin360. Since the first Bitcoin block was generated back in 2009, there have been three halving events. Taking place once every 210,000 blocks mined, or approximately once every four years, a Bitcoin halving cuts the current miner block reward by 50%. The first Bitcoin halving event took place in 2012, cutting the original block reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. The second halving took place in 2016, with the reward dropping from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. As Bitcoin���s supply is limited to 21 million coins, Bitcoin halving events should continue to take place until the year 2140, or until the 21-millionth BTC. By that time, the block reward should reach 1 satoshi, or the smallest unit of Bitcoin at 0.00000001 BTC. At the time of publication, the number of Bitcoin in circulation amounts to 18.37 million, according to Blockchain.com. As the two previous Bitcoin halvings eventually impacted Bitcoin���s price in positive ways, Bitcoin halvings have become the subject of diverse price predictions and speculation. While some crypto players have predicted that the third Bitcoin halving will have no effect on Bitcoin's price, others are confident that the halving will definitely affect the price of the cryptocurrency due to a cut in new Bitcoin supply. While Bitcoin price correlation appears to be questionable, the latest Bitcoin halving has a direct impact on miners. A number of crypto experts predict that the new halving will imminently trigger miners to shut down generating new Bitcoin as a wide number of mining devices will become outdated. According to mining pool Poolin���s vice president, Alejandro De La Torre, a number of unprofitable miners had already begun shutting down their equipment before the Bitcoin halving on Monday. Bitcoin���s halving has just happened, but Cointelegraph���s Bitcoin halving party still continues on YouTube. Check out the schedule and use this link to join.	0
Billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway���s Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett reiterated his negative stance towards cryptocurrencies at the annual meeting of his company Saturday, May 5. Buffet repeated his idea that cryptocurrencies will come to a ���bad ending,��� and claimed that Bitcoin (BTC) is "probably rat poison squared," according to CNBC. In response to a question on Buffet���s view of cryptocurrencies raised by an attendee from Ukraine, the ���Oracle Of Omaha��� has made yet another anti-crypto statement. According to Buffet, Bitcoin is not a ���productive��� asset, unlike land or corporate shares. As a result, investors��� demand for it is the only price-determining factor, making digital currency a handy tool for ���charlatans,��� Buffet said. The billionaire investor claimed that cryptocurrency community is in for a ���bad ending��� after the ���euphoria wears off.��� Berkshire Hathaway���s Vice Chairman Charlie Munger echoed Buffet���s criticism of cryptocurrency investment, albeit in much harsher terms: "Someone else is trading turds and you decide I can't be left out." Earlier in February, Munger called Bitcoin ���totally asinine��� and argued that people get involved in crypto ���because everybody wants easy money.��� 87-year-old Buffet is known for his scepticism towards cryptocurrencies. The billionaire investor has made repeated statements claiming that Bitcoin is neither a currency, nor a way of investing. In October 2017, Buffet claimed that Bitcoin had entered the ���bubble territory,��� and is ���going to implode.��� Some institutional players, on the other hand, are much more enthusiastic about Bitcoin. For example, the banking giant Goldman Sachs has launched a Bitcoin trading operation earlier this week, commenting that Bitcoin ���is not a fraud.���	1
All eyes are on Litecoin amid a surge in price rivaling the recent rebound of Bitcoin. Charlie Lee���s cryptocurrency, created in 2011, was surging up to 30 percent over the last 24 hours, for a number of reasons. According to CNBC, Litepay CEO Kenneth Asare announced that over 41 countries, including the likes of the US, UK, China and Germany will have access to Litepay���s payment system. Meanwhile, Coinbase also announced that it would be launching it���s ���Coinbase Commerce��� software which will allow vendors to accept payments in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum as well as Litecoin. Another factor in the surge of price in Litecoin is the supposed upcoming fork, which will create Litecoin Cash. In a situation that some are likening to the Bitcoin-Bitcoin Cash saga, holders of Litecoin are being promised 10 Litecoin Cash for every Litecoin they hold. The Litecoin Cash website states that the new coin, LCC, will be governed by Bitcoins SHA256 algorithm instead of Scrypt which verifies Litecoin transactions. The website is also enticing users to jump onboard - by touting the use of legacy Bitcoin mining hardware to mine the upcoming LCC coin. The hard fork is scheduled for Sunday Feb. 18, or Litecoin block 1371111. As the image below shows, the forked cryptocurrency will have a maximum supply ten times that of Litecoin - with users able to claim coins in a 10:1 ratio and mine coins after that.  Image source: Litecoinca.sh The Litecoin Cash fork was announced on Feb. 3, and it didn���t take long for Litecoin founder Charlie Lee to denounce the fork. PSA: The Litecoin team and I are not forking Litecoin. Any forks that you hear about is a scam trying to confuse you to think it's related to Litecoin. Don't fall for it and definitely don't enter your private keys or seed into their website or client. Be careful out there! https://t.co/qXbiIxp5Al Interestingly, the Litecoin Cash website claims to be following good practice in the crypto community, by taking on the name of the coin they are forking. ���We're using the Litecoin Cash name simply because it has become customary in recent months for a coin which forks a Blockchain to prefix its name with the name of the coin being forked. This practice has become a widely understood convention. We're not associated or affiliated with Charlie Lee or any of the Litecoin team in any way; we are big fans though.��� Lee hasn���t been the only member of the crypto community to denounce the fork. Cypherpunk Jameson Lopp took to Twitter, with a tongue-cheek post that seemed to poke fun at Roger Ver and his take on Bitcoin Cash followed by a tweet highlighting the absurd number of ���Bitcoin��� forks trying to take advantage of the name: Litecoin Cash is the real Litecoin that follows @SatoshiLite's Vision!https://t.co/qzzBIamwnD  *ducks* pic.twitter.com/BgDGXXNrRO Another Twitter user warned of an all out scam- highlighting the fact the Litecoin developers have no affiliating with the form: I will say this ONCE. $LTC is NOT having a Hard Fork. @SatoshiLite has also stated that Litecoin Cash is a SCAM. Do NOT buy $LCC. Brian Haggerty pointed out that Litecoin Cash doesn���t even have a white paper, and urged people to protect their Litecoin wallet private keys: #litecoincash has NO White Paper. And DO NOT, repeat. Do not give your private keys to any site to receive the forked Litecoincash coins! This whole thing seems very absurd! #Litecoin is fine on it���s own. Be VERY careful, folks! One of the most interesting facets of the Litecoin Cash fork is maybe its intended support of legacy mining hardware. The creators of Litecoin Cash seem to be interested in creating a new cryptocurrency that allows owners of older Bitcoin mining hardware to put their equipment to use once again. Litecoin Cash���s mining difficulty will reportedly be governed by Evan Duffield's DarkGravity V3 algorithm from Dash while claiming new blocks will be created every 2.5 minutes - ���four times the transaction bandwidth of Bitcoin, while transactions are 90 percent cheaper than Litecoin.��� While some Litecoin holders will be more than happy to get an airdrop of a new cryptocurrency, they should be aware that their Litecoin needs to be in an actual Litecoin desktop wallet, not just an exchange. Although Bitcoin Cash has garnered the support of exchanges around the world - it seems unlikely that big exchanges will play ball with this fork. The simple fact that Litecoin���s founder has denounced the coin could stop most from moving in that direction.	1
Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the board of Germany's Bundesbank, has suggested that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies would require international cooperation. Speaking at an event in Frankfurt on Jan. 15, the director told listeners: "Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited.��� After the Chinese government banned cryptocurrency exchanges from operating domestically in September, many Chinese crypto traders simply moved their activities to exchanges in Japan, and possibly South Korea, according to some analysts. Many countries globally have already attempted regulatory control over cryptocurrencies in different ways. China has created the most strict controls, banning crypto exchanges and ICOs and now attempting to close all ���exchange like services���. South Korea���s Justice Minister recently proposed a trading ban and the government has put other controls into place in the face of what some see as a ���cryptocurrency mania��� in the country.  Russia has suggested some measure of legality for trading on ���official exchanges���. The US is seeing regulation of cryptocurrency both on a federal and state level. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued multiple warnings for crypto investors last year, and has already taken action against Blockchain or crypto-related companies. On the state level, regulators in Texas recently issued a cease and desist order to a UK-based crypto company allegedly selling unlicensed securities to Texas residents.	2
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose to as high as $10,272 on July 26 in an unexpected weekend rally. It liquidated $74 million worth of long contracts on BitMEX alone, catching many traders off guard.  The hourly price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.com There appear to be two main reasons behind the abrupt upsurge of Bitcoin from $9,700 to over $10,200. They are the liquidation of over-leveraged shorts and traders taking profit from over-extended alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). When the price started to rally, major altcoins, as well as well-performing DeFi tokens, began to slump. Ethereum declined from $322 to $311, and DeFi tokens, including Aave and YFI, saw steep rejections.   Cryptocurrency market performance July 26. Source: Coin360 The simultaneous rejections of major altcoins and the price surge of Bitcoin suggest that traders took profit from recent altcoin rallies. As traders moved their altcoin gains to Bitcoin, it possibly triggered a BTC uptrend, while altcoins declined. ETH, as an example, rose from $247 on July 23 to $322 on the day���s peak, recording a 30% gain. Despite the strong sentiment around altcoins, investors are possibly taking a more cautious approach by hedging their gains. When Bitcoin initially broke over $10,000, it triggered over-leveraged short contracts to become liquidated. When BTC reached $10,200, it caused a cascade of liquidations to occur, totaling $74 million. Bitcoin has seen many phases when more than $50 million worth of short or long contracts gets liquidated. But for this to occur within a span of a few hours is less typical. The mass liquidations of long contracts at $10,000 also suggest that the $10,000 to $10,200 remains as a heavy resistance area. As soon as BTC hit $10,200, the price dropped below $10,000, marking a short-lived rally. As the price of Bitcoin recovered strongly in recent weeks, some industry executives and investors expressed optimism toward BTC and ETH. ���Are you ready?��� Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert tweeted when Ether price broke out of the dreaded $280 resistance level on July 25. Well-known trader Peter Brandt, meanwhile, expects the price of Bitcoin to hit a new record high and eventually make its way to $50,000. He said: ���That is actually where my head is. Massive symmetrical triangle in $BTC points to ATHs, then $50k.��� But some variables could affect the short-term price trend of BTC price. First, the funding rate of Bitcoin is projected to be over 0.04% on BitMEX. That is nearly four times higher than the average funding rate of 0.01%. It signifies that the majority of the market is taking long positions. For Ethereum���s ETH token, the funding rate is hovering at over 0.1%, which suggests the rally is beginning to get overheated. In February, ETH���s price rejected at $280 as its funding rate surpassed 0.2%, and when the overwhelming majority of the market was longing the asset. Second, $10,000 has acted as a key psychological level for Bitcoin since October 2019. If BTC rejects at $10,200, it would still be lower than the previous peak in February 2020 at $10,473.  Although it would be far-fetched to call it a lower high formation, it might show that BTC price has not cleanly broken out of the multi-month range.	2
The local government in Dubai has officially launched its own cryptocurrency called emCash, according to announcements by local news media outlets. The cryptocurrency would be used for payment of governmental and nongovernmental services. According to Ali Ibrahim, Deputy Director General of Dubai Economy, the token will be considered legal tender ���for various government and non-government services, from their daily coffee and children���s school fee to utility charges and money transfers.��� The flexibility and convenience of cryptocurrencies makes the solution a win-win for Dubai. The government is strongly pro-Blockchain and sees it as the next major wave of paradigm changing technologies, and wants to be forward-thinking in adoption. According to Ibrahim: ���The fast-paced environment and incredible willingness to adopt innovative technology has made Dubai the perfect place for us to do business. This project is a great example of the ambition we have met here, together we are essentially creating a whole new economic ecosystem. It will harness Blockchain technology to make financial transactions cheaper, faster and more secure while demonstrating the huge advantages of embracing this technology for governments, business and customers alike.��� Blockchain technology, as a system for a number of various services, has been widely embraced in the country. Dubai is seeking to become a fintech hub for the eastern world and has even recently signed deals to allow for property sales entirely in Bitcoin. The new cryptocurrency will move the country���s adoption paradigm forward.	2
The U.S. dollar is getting so weak that even Warren Buffett is getting out and Bitcoin (BTC) will see all-time highs, says Max Keiser. In his latest forecast for macro, the RT host warned that safe havens would seriously outperform fiat. Buffett, he implied, knew what was coming. ���Buffett���s move into Japan, along with his gold investment, confirms he���s getting out of USD bigly,��� Keiser wrote on Twitter on Monday.  ���USD is trending lower today, about to break key support. Bitcoin - Gold - Silver Will all make new ATH in the near term.��� He was referring to Buffett���s move into Japanese assets, taking a 5% stake in the country���s five biggest trading houses in a move totaling $6 billion, Reuters reported. ���The five major trading companies have many joint ventures throughout the world and are likely to have more. I hope that in the future there may be opportunities of mutual benefit,��� the publication quoted him saying. The announcement came days after the Federal Reserve confirmed that it would let inflation rise above its 2% target as a temporary measure, something that weighed heavily on the dollar. After volatility, the USD currency index (DXY) began plunging to new depths on Monday, bouncing off its lowest levels in two years. Late in July, when those levels first appeared, Bitcoin saw a price jump to $12,500. As Cointelegraph reported, expectations remain that further dives in the DXY will produce similar effects.  USD currency index 1-day chart. Source: TradingView Buffett, meanwhile is well known for his macro moves, even as he remains a steadfast Bitcoin skeptic.  Last week, the so-called ���Buffett Indicator��� warned about a stock market crash, even as large-cap equities continued their climbs higher. Prior to that, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, publicly bet on Buffett eventually buying Bitcoin after he revealed his move into gold. At the time, Keiser claimed that the gold entry alone would spark a run among investors, helping push BTC/USD to $50,000. Perhaps Buffett���s most famous quip about Bitcoin is from 2018 when he referred to cryptocurrency as ���rat poison squared.���	2
Predicting is a big part in cryptocurrencies, especially when it comes to prices, but in this volatile market it is not only the price that can see-saw, all kinds of occurrences are affecting this burgeoning market. This has led to people to speculate already what 2018 will hold for the cryptocurrency world. 2017 was definitely a massive platform on which a sturdy foundation was built for this market, but what does 2018 hold? As Bitcoin peaked to $20,000 just before Christmas last year, it was unstoppable in both its growth and dominance, but since then it has dropped away in both respects as altcoin seasoned opened up the new year. The original cryptocurrency saw its dominance fall to below 33 percent as others such as Ripple, Stellar and Tron have snatched some of the overall market cap. However, already on the comeback trail, the belief is that Bitcoin will still be the market leader through 2018. Erik Voorhees, CEO of digital asset exchange ShapeShift, has said that there has been a decline in Bitcoin���s dominance in transactions since a year ago on their platform, but that Bitcoin is actually benefiting from growth in Altcoins. "Bitcoin has such magnificent network effects that I don't see another altcoin that's a little better at payments" or some other function right now, Autonomous' Global Director of fintech strategy, Lex Sokolin said. Already, after mostly laughing, then shunning, then finally taking note, the Wall Street-types have been forced to pay attention to Bitcoin. It has led to more institutions either accepting Bitcoin or even joining the fray. The likes of CME and CBOE taking up Bitcoin futures are indicators of this. "Our institutional investor base is very interested in learning more and getting exposure," said Michael Graham, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, said. "With the regulated futures markets going live in 2017, the stage is set for ETFs to gain approval in 2018," Nolan Bauerle said. "In fact, the CBOE filed for six cryptocurrency ETFs at the end of 2017 which could go live in 2018. This would dramatically increase how institutional investors can get exposure." Up until now, regulation has been a symptom treatment rather than an established procedure on the cryptocurrency market as they are still playing catch up. However, 2018 will be a year for them to consolidate and make up ground as cryptocurrencies steady and slow somewhat in their pioneering ways. ���One of the things we'll see is enforcement here from the regulators," Canaccord���s Graham added. He expects that greater regulation will cause a "major price dislocation event for the whole sector." Regulators will no doubt cause some issues in the growth as they spook the burgeoning but fragile market. Spencer Bogart, managing director and head of research at venture capital firm Blockchain Capital is predicting big losses in regulation. "I think we could easily purge 60-75 percent of crypto hedge funds in this type of market," Bogart said. "In this environment, funds that can call capital and deploy it counter-cyclically stand to benefit significantly." You cannot talk about Bitcoin without making mention of its volatile market nature, and although it is a year older and wiser, it will still be a wild ride. ���We think we're going to have more forks in 2018 than 2017," Canaccord's Graham continued. "Ultimately we think those forks are going to be a short-term tailwind to Bitcoin's value and a long-term headwind."	1
Reports surfaced Saturday night that Tether and their auditor, Friedman LLP, had dissolved their relationship. Due to the weekend, independent confirmation has not been received. Calls to Friedman LLP have gone to voicemail. It does seem unusual for either company to take such an action without issuing a formal statement, particularly since this would create a firestorm. Many in the crypto community have had concerns about whether Tether truly maintains adequate reserves to redeem all the outstanding tether tokens. The company had hired Friedman LLP to conduct an audit in an effort to resolve the community���s concern. Tether has been the source of much controversy for the past year, and the company has struggled to respond to critics. The company, which shares some of the same owners as Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange, wrote last fall: ���Friedman LLP has been engaged to perform historical balance sheet audit procedures for Tether Limited. However, as the amount of Tethers in circulation has increased substantially in recent months, we have also asked Friedman to analyze our bank balances and our issued and outstanding token balance on an interim basis. Friedman agreed to perform consulting services for us in an effort to provide management with useful information concerning Tether���s cash position and Tether tokens issued and outstanding as of an interim date. Friedman was able to provide consulting services for us on an expedited basis, using a procedures date of September 15, 2017. These consulting services do not constitute an audit or attestation engagement, which would include a significantly expanded scope of procedures and take substantially more time to complete.��� Any ���dissolution��� of the relationship between Tether and Friedman LLP would invite great suspicion from the community, as this would seem to run contrary to Tether���s desire for greater transparency. Tether (the company) claims to receive deposits of US dollars from investors, following which they create an equivalent number of tethers (the currency) and give those tethers to the depositor. Tether claims to have $2.2 bln on deposit in its bank accounts to back every tether token in existence on a 1:1 basis. Without an audit, though, it cannot be proven that Tether in fact has those reserves, or that they are not being used for something besides the backing of tether tokens. Some in the digital currency community have expressed deep skepticism over the issuance of tether tokens. It is not uncommon for the company to release massive amounts of tether, 50-100 mln at a time, which leaves many wondering who the investors are that deposit those funds. Since the disruption of Bitfinex���s banking relationships early last year, the exchange has become heavily dependent on its sister company���s tokens to move funds in and out of the exchange. Some have speculated that Tether may be operating a fractional reserve, issuing more tokens than they have backing for, and sending them to Bitfinex. The exchange then uses those tokens as collateral to create leveraged long or short positions in the Bitcoin market. Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, has commented: There's a fear going on that the recent price rise was helped by printing of USDT (Tether) that is not backed by USD in a bank account.   I urge @bitfinex and @Tether_to to perform a 3rd party audit to prove their reserves. Please do the right thing. Thanks. In early December, Bitfinex threatened to ���pursue legal action��� against the anonymous blogger ���Bitfinex���ed��� based on his claims of wrongdoing on the part of Bitfinex and Tether. This story will be updated as more information becomes available.	0
The Ethereum spring continues. From a unit price of $8.52 in the beginning of the year, Ethereum reached its all-time high this week, topping at an incredible $269.36 per unit. The price is up by over 3,000 percent since January 2017. This week, Ethereum traded at an all-time high of $269.36, according to data from WorldCoinIndex. It has stabilized slightly below that price since June 6. The figure below retraces its 3,000 percent growth since the beginning of 2017.  Many factors have led to this record rally, which fit pretty well in the quadriptych of the EEA, ICOs, South Korea and Russia.  In March 2017, Blockchain startups, research labs and global companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). The goal of this alliance is to collectively develop industry standards and encourage collaboration between its various members. The EEA now counts hundreds of members, among which include Microsoft, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Deloitte, Accenture, ING, ConsenSys and the Toyota Research Institute. The alliance is seeking to work on common projects and contribute to the future of the Ethereum permissionless Blockchain by focusing on its scalability, privacy and confidentiality. Julio Faura, chairman of the EEA, says: ���The enthusiasm around EEA is remarkable. Our new members come from varying industries such as pharma, mobile, banking, automotive, management consulting, and hardware as well as the startup community driving innovation. It���s great to see everyone come together and build the next generation of our economy on Ethereum blockchain solutions.��� Such an initiative is without a doubt giving legitimacy to Ethereum, and played a role in its recent rally. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a new way for Blockchain startups to raise millions of dollars in short periods of time, by selling custom tokens. This type of offering has flourished without a legal or regulatory framework, and it is perhaps exactly what made it so attractive. Smith + Crown is a Blockchain consulting firm that tracks ICOs and their achievements. According to the firm, ICOs raised $101 mln in 2016. Since the beginning of 2017, the total amount raised has passed the $300 mln bar, which represents a near 200 percent increase in less than six months. Many of the recent initiatives in this field are based on the Ethereum Blockchain due to its smart contracts capabilities, and thus, ICOs use Ether tokens and, therefore, contribute to raising the unit price of ETH. South Korea���s three largest digital currency exchanges have integrated Ether, making it the largest Ethereum exchange market with a $335 mln daily trading volume. Since then, and over the past few months, the country accounted for around 38 percent of the total trading volume of Ethereum. The sudden interest in ETH from South Korea is so strong that the ETH/KRW pair processes more trades than the ETH/BTC pair, which used to account for over 50 percent of all Ethereum trading. At Cointelegraph, we recently commented on this historical meeting. Even though not many details have been revealed following it, we do know President Vladimir Putin is ready to support the development of Blockchain technology. This interest has been further confirmed by referring to this meeting on the Kremlin���s website and through its Press Secretary. These are, in my opinion, the four main factors that altogether drove the price of Ethereum to its all-time high this year. What will come next?	2
In Forbes' third edition of the ���Fintech 50���, a list of the top 50 financial technology companies globally of 2018, released on Feb. 13, eleven of the companies listed use Blockchain technology or are connected to the cryptocurrency industry. The founders of three of the companies, The Bitfury Group, Coinbase, and Ripple that made the Fintech 50 also made Forbes' list of the ���Richest People in Cryptocurrency��� released last week. Forbes' site has a separate article breaking down the influence of Blockchain and crypto companies that made the Fintech 50 list. Forbes writes that perhaps unseen behind the nonstop news coverage of crypto price volatility, the Blockchain companies listed in the Fintech 50 are ���building infrastructure���to support both public cryptocurrency markets and initiatives that could transform how current financial transactions are executed and recorded.��� Of the nine companies that Forbes lists as ���The Future of Blockchain And Cryptocurrency���, five have made the Fintech 50 list for the first time this year. Each of the nine companies are profiled with a small blurb about their activities, their cofounders, their funding, and who they are a ���threat to.��� For example, the company Blockchain is described as the ���world���s most popular cryptocurrency wallet��� that is a threat to Coinbase and Xapo, while Chain, which offers office Blockchain technology and ledger balance software, is described as a threat to ���inefficient legacy record keeping in finance.��� Veem and Robinhood, which made the Fintech 50 list, but which Forbes does not mention on its Blockchain and crypto side list, are also associated with the crypto world. Veem is a sending and receiving payment system for businesses that uses Blockchain technology, and Robinhood is a stock trading app that recently announced the launch of zero-fee crypto trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) for its users this month.	2
Fundstrat���s Tom Lee has predicted a ���massive outflow��� of cryptocurrency to fiat in the lead up to tax day in the US, CNBC reports today, April 5. In a Thursday report Lee notes that, since US households owe an estimated $25 bln in capital gains taxes due to their crypto holdings, and crypto exchanges also will owe income taxes, both households and exchanges will be selling their crypto to pay the US government: ���We believe there is selling pressure by crypto exchanges who are subject to income tax in U.S. jurisdictions. Many exchanges have net income in 2017 [of more than] $1 bln and keep working capital in [Bitcoin]/[Ethereum], not USD ��� hence, to meet these tax liabilities, are selling BTC/ETH.��� According to Lee, ���historical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.��� The crypto markets reported near 50 percent losses across the first quarter of 2018, marking BTCs and ETH���s worst first quarter performances in the history of the coins. However, anyone that capitalized on the crypto market spike in December 2017 that saw BTC���s price rise to $20,000 will need to pay capital gains tax on their earnings. Lee���s Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI), created in mid-March to show how ���miserable��� BTC holders are based on the current price, shows that crypto holders are currently feeling the ���misery:��� "Regulatory headline risk is still substantial. And sentiment remains awful, as measured by our Bitcoin misery index, which is still reading misery.��� Lee concludes that "[u]ltimately, we expect Bitcoin to find footing after April [17], tax day.��� Lee most recently predicted that Bitcoin will hit $91,000 by March 2020, based on BTC���s performance after past market dips. In January of this year, when BTC���s price was around $9,000, Lee told CNBC that BTC would hit $25,000 by the end of 2018, instead of by 2022 like he had previously predicted.	0
Bitcoin���s price will ���explode��� but mass adoption is ���not going to happen,��� Allianz���s chief economic advisor has said.   Speaking on US media network CNBC���s Squawk segment, Mohamed El-Erian told a panel that Bitcoin should be worth half or one third of its then $4000 price.       ���The current pricing assume massive adoption, and I don't think governments will allow the amount of adoption that's currently priced in,��� he explained.   ���I think the price will explode, but I think it will exist because it���s a peer-to-peer currency.���    El-Erian joins an increasingly high profile debate on Bitcoin���s future, after China spooked markets with unsubstantiated claims it will ban exchanges, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called it a ���fraud.���   Dimon also suggested Bitcoin���s only ���limited��� use case would be as a p2p currency, specifically for Venezuelan citizens, North Korea and drug dealers.   ���It exists in that world,��� El-Erian continued about Bitcoin���s use as such a currency. ���But current prices assume massive adoption, which is not going to happen."   The increasing divergence in perspective between traditional finance figures and pro-cryptocurrency voices such as John McAfee, Max Keiser and investor Jeremy Liew, all of whom have given sky-high Bitcoin price predictions for the near term, is palpable.   As of press time, Bitcoin had meanwhile lost 5.3 percent in 24 hours to circle $3700. On Wednesday, analyst Tone Vays suggested the ���perfect buy floor��� would be $3000, where strong support meant he ���didn���t think it will go any lower.���	1
The pump and dump, an age-old scheme to quickly raise the value of a worthless asset and then selling it to reap the profits from the price increase. Not only is the pump and dump illegally under the securities laws, but it is also extremely popular in the world of Blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and digital assets. In a pump and dump scheme, the price of a worthless asset-usually a penny stock with a low market cap-is artificially inflated through well-planned marketing. False statements, misleading statements, a large number of social media posts, co-signs, and other chicanery are used to get the word out that a worthless asset is actually a hot buy that investors do not want to miss out on (the pump). To support these claims, the price of the worthless asset is increasing rapidly due to the well-planned pump. Once investors get word about the worthless asset and see its price rising rapidly, more investors start to buy up shares of the stock. This is when individuals who are in on the pump and dump scheme will sell or ���dump��� the shares of the overvalued asset. These individuals profit from selling the asset at or near its peak for many times more than the price they purchased it at. When they begin to sell their shares of the overvalued asset, the price of the asset tanks and corrects to a more accurate and appropriate valuation. Before the invention of the Internet, pump and dumps were much harder to organize. Individuals had to organize pump and dumps in person, via telephone, or via snail mail. Pump and dump schemes were often organized by ���Boiler Rooms,��� outbound call centers that were known for using dishonest sales tactics like promoting penny stocks to turn a profit. With the creation of the Internet, it became far easier to execute a pump and dump scheme. These days, individuals converse in chat rooms, via messaging apps, and on Internet message boards to coordinate a pump and dump. With all the venues that the Internet provides to converse with each other, the Commodities Futures Trading Commision (CFTC) has become wary that pump and dump schemes could even sway professional investors into taking on an amount of risk that they did not intend to undergo. On Feb. 15, the CTFC released their first Pump and-Dump Virtual Currency Customer Protection Advisory statement. ���Customers should know that these frauds have evolved and are prevalent online. Even experienced investors can become targets of professional fraudsters who are experts at deploying seemingly credible information in an attempt to deceive.��� The advisory even quoted messages from an online chatroom coordinating a pump and dump,  ���15 mins left before the pump! Get ready to buy.��� ���Five minutes till pump, next message will be the coin! Tweet about us and send everyone the link to telegram (sic) for outsiders to see what we are pumping so they can get in on the action too!! lets (sic) take it to the MOON!!!!!��� In the scheme cited above, the entire pump and dump process only lasted eight minutes. The CTFC warns consumers: ���Customers should avoid purchasing virtual currency or tokens based on tips shared over social media. The organizers of the scheme will commonly spread rumors and urge immediate buying. Victims will commonly react to the currency���s or token���s rising prices, and not verify the rumors. Then the dump begins. The price falls and victims are left with currency or tokens that are worth much less than what they expected. From beginning to end, these scams can be over in just a few minutes.��� As the market for cryptocurrency continues to grow, government organizations give the burgeoning market the attention that it needs to develop. This includes releasing detailed reports like the CFTC Primer on Virtual Currencies, holding hearings with Congress, and giving consumers all the available information they have to mitigate the chance that the consumer will be susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Pump and dump schemes are illegal and considered securities fraud by the SEC. In most regulated markets like the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, they are illegal as well. The CTFC is even offering a 10-30 percent bounty for any pump and dump whistleblowers who are able to lead the CTFC to monetary sanctions of $1 mln or more. However, pump and dump schemes aren���t illegal on cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrency exchanges are not regulated; there is no piece of the legislature about cryptocurrency exchanges. So even though a pump and dump is unethical, it is not officially illegal (yet). Cointelegraph reached out to anti-money laundering (AML) specialist Joe Ciccolo, founder of BitAML-a company that provides anti-money laundering solutions for digital currency startups. When asked about the legal status development of pump and dumps in the cryptocurrency market, and if it is possible to whistleblow in an unregulated industry, Ciccolo said: ���The CFTC, like other financial regulators, will continue leveraging existing enforcement resources. Whistleblower programs, a common regulatory tool, have generally worked remarkably well at putting crucial and credible information into the hands of investigators. The CFTC has rightfully prioritized consumer education and protection by focusing on detecting and deterring fraudulent activities, such as pump and dump schemes, while not stifling early innovation in the crypto space.��� A well-planned pump and dump could earn investors over 100 percent return on investment. In one case, an altcoin pumping group was able to pump a coins price by over 950 percent. At 11:40 a.m. on July 2 the moderator of the chatroom announced that the next pump would take place in 20 minutes on Bittrex. 15 minutes later, the moderator announced that the pump and dump would take place in 5 minutes (12:00 pm). At 12 p.m. the moderator announced the name of the coin, SLS, and sent a link to the relevant market on Bittrex. At the start of the pump, the SLS coin was worth .0046 BTC ($11.61 based on July 2 price). At the height of the pump, SLS was worth .0438  BTC ($110 based on July 2 price), and after the dump, SLS was back at .0059 BTC ($14.90).    Image source: Altcoin Pumping Group 2/2 Telegram Chat In November of 2017, a Business Insider investigation revealed that traders were coordinating pump and dumps on Bittrex and Yobit via the messaging app Telegram. Shortly afterward, Bittrex issued a statement: ���A general statement about market manipulation tactics:  Bittrex actively discourages any type of market manipulation, including pump groups.  Consistent with our terms of service, we will suspend and close any accounts engaging in this type of activity and notify the appropriate authorities.��� Following the announcement, pump groups on Telegram warned their members that Bittrex would be cracking down on manipulative behavior. One group-Trading signals for crypto-canceled their pump and dumps due to Bittrex��� policy change. Another group-Fake Pump&Dump Hunter-was interested in knowing if Bittrex���s announcement was a scare tactic or if it had actually been enforced. Fake Pump&Dump Hunter requested that any user who had their account suspended by Bittrex get in contact with them.     Image source: Business Insider Pump and dump groups often have thousands of members. At one point, Trading signals for crypto had over 7,000 members. Some members are professional investors and pump organizers who invested in the coin way before the date of the pump; others are retail investors, who find out which coin is being pumped at the same time the pump begins. Although the cryptocurrency industry is maturing and taking the necessary steps to merge with the traditional banking and finance system. Blockchain and cryptocurrency is still in its Wild West phase. Due to a lack of regulation and consumer protections in the cryptocurrency markets, there are still enough opportunities to pull off fraudulent and manipulative schemes like the pump and dump. That is why it is always better to do independent research of the assets you are interested in investing in, and to only take on an amount of risk that allows you to sleep comfortably at night. To protect investors against manipulative markets, The CTFC���s advisory also gave consumers the following warnings:	1
Shark Tank investor Kevin O���Leary has offered both encouragement and warning to Bitcoin investors in a recent interview on CNBC���s Make It. He offered a stiff warning for those who don���t understand Bitcoin, and an encouragement that the cryptocurrency is definitely an asset, if not a viable currency. O���Leary was quick to point out that those wanting to invest in Bitcoin but who don���t understand it may create a ���cocktail for disaster.��� He said: "I'm quite sure that 99 percent of the people that own Bitcoin do not understand how it works. That always is a cocktail for disaster. You should never invest in something you don't understand.��� Additionally, O���Leary made it clear that, at this stage, Bitcoin is not suitable as a currency for transactions. In his own experience, he was unable to complete a $200,000 transaction because the other party was concerned over volatility. Nevertheless, the famous investor was not completely down on Bitcoin either. He views the cryptocurrency as one of the most successful assets in the world, based on global speculation.  In the final analysis, he concluded, Bitcoin may go up or down, and so it���s more of a gamble than an investment. He advises investors to only put in what they can afford to lose, saying: "I don't know if it is going to $40,000 or zero, and nobody knows. So, I just think it is a wonderful entertainment, just like a slot machine is, or putting chips on a roulette wheel. Right now it is fun, exciting, entertaining. As long as you can afford to lose everything you put into it, go with it.���	0
In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph during Virtual Blockchain Week, privacy coin advocate, fugitive, and self-proclaimed candidate for the president of the United States, John McAfee, asserted that he knows the identity of Satoshi Nakmoto with 99% certainty. The discussion came following an eventful discussion at the conference, with McAfee rejecting COVID-19 as a government conspiracy and brandishing his AK-47 on camera. Speaking to Cointelegraph, McAfee described the popular belief that an individual named Satoshi designed Bitcoin as ���nonsense,��� stating: ���It was a team of eleven people over a period of five years, that came up, eventually, with [Bitcoin]. ���How they decided who would write the paper, I don���t know. But anybody who wants to know who it is ��� I mean, you know who the options are, you���ve got Craig Wright possibly, I���m not going to name everyone else otherwise you���ll figure out who it is, but somebody wrote the whitepaper,��� he continued.  McAfee asserts that linguistic analysis of the whitepaper, also known as stylometry, is all that is needed to uncover Satoshi���s identity. ���If you read the whitepaper, number one, it's totally clear he���s English ��� every single word that has a different spelling in English and American is English,��� McAfee asserts. ���Number two, he left tells. There is only five percent of the population that has two spaces after a period ��� everything has two spaces after a period. And, the format of the document was identical to documents that he had published professionally,��� he adds. ���If you buy a two-hundred dollar authorship program, and you take the whitepaper and you run it through, and you take any one of the papers that he���s published ��� all of these people wrote papers by the way, only one comes out with ninety-nine percent probability it's him.��� McAfee recounts that he had previously planned to publicly reveal Satoshi���s identity, before deciding against such after a phone call with the individual. ���I have spoken to him on the phone, I was actually going to divulge who he was. Why? Because all of this nonsense was just stupid, people wasting time over nothing ��� I was going to say, ���listen, it was this guy,������ McAfee said. ���And you know what he told me? Very smart motherf*****, he said ���Ok, what if you���re wrong?��� He goes, ���if you���re right, then Satoshi is going to have to hire fifty security guards and change his life,  or else he will die.��� Why? Everyone is going to want a piece of him, including the governments that demand that he pay taxes.��� ���He said, ���Ok, if you���re right, then that person has the ability to do something. But what if you���re wrong? You will end up destroying an innocent man���s life forever, and probably cause his death,������ continued McAfee. ���At that moment, I said ���I understand, I won���t say no more, and your name will never leave my lips.��� And that is why I never continued past Craig Wright, because the name would have to leave my lips.��� ���But if you want to know, figure it out yourself, it's easy.���	1
Samsung announced a deal on Monday, Jan. 29 to manufacture ASIC mining hardware with Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC. ���Mass production��� of the ASIC chip has already begun in January, according to Korean news outlet The Bell. An ASIC chip, which stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, is a specialized piece of hardware designed to only mine cryptocurrencies based on a specific hashing algorithm, such as SHA256 or Scrypt (which Bitcoin and Litecoin run on, respectively). It makes up part of a crypto mining device. TSMC supplies the ASIC chips needed for cryptocurrency mining to Bitmain, a China-based Bitcoin mining company. Bitmain also manufactures its own hardware, having released two ASIC-style products in September 2017 to relatively negative fanfare as well as an unexpected launch of a SiaCoin miner on Jan. 19. In regards to the profitability of Samsung entering the crypto mining market, Hwang Min-seong, an analyst at Samsung Securities, told The Bell: ���Samsung Electronics could increase its revenues through ASIC chip manufacturing but because the foundry only accounts for a small portion of the company���s semi-conductor manufacturing plant, it is difficult to predict that the firm���s mining venture will have a significant impact on the company���s revenues.��� South Korea-based Samsung���s deal with TSMC comes after a turbulent month in the crypto markets in Asia, with exchanges banned in China and accusations of insider trading and confusion over regulation in South Korea leading to losses across the board.	2
A DNS hijack has led to hackers withdrawing $400,000 worth of Stellar Lumen (XLM) coins from wallets hosted by Blackwallet.co without users��� permission. As multiple sources report, on Saturday, Jan. 13, attackers took control of BlackWallet���s hosting server, changing settings to allow code to run which automatically sent customer balances over 20XLM to an address under the hackers��� control. Almost 670,000 tokens are currently missing as a result of the attack, likely explaining XLM���s almost 23 percent dive over the past 48 hours. On social media, desperate efforts to contain the threat before the service was taken offline saw BlackWallet���s developer caution users to move their funds elsewhere if they had entered their wallet information since Saturday. The developer, known as u/orbit84 on Reddit, wrote: ���I am sincerely sorry about this and hope that we will get the funds back. I am in talks with my hosting provider to get as much information about the hacker and will see what can be done with it. If you ever entered your key on blackwallet, you may want to move your funds to a new wallet using the stellar account viewer������ A Reddit user u/nuclearping has apparently managed to identify the hosting provider which services BlackWallet as 1&1. If that is the case, the event would be the second such incident involving 1&1. In August last year, hackers persuaded a customer service representative at the company to cede control of Classic Ether Wallet���s domain from its original owner. The result was mass losses of funds and sensitive user information being stolen, sources reported at the time. The BlackWallet developer meanwhile added an edit to his original Reddit post asking community members not to ���spread rumors��� about the German hosting provider.	0
There is little doubting why, in the run up to Bitcoin all time high of $20,000, people were entering the cryptocurrency market. There was a promise of massive growth, potentially huge returns on investment, and a story already told of missing out as an early adopter. People thus flooded the market, entering for all the wrong reasons, really. However, this created a massive spike in interest and a massive spike in price. Things have changed somewhat now, with Bitcoin heading towards $6,000 rather than above $20,000, and this has caused a huge sell off as investors now flood out of the market. But what reasons remain today for people to buy Bitcoin? The issue was, with this massive spike in interest, that people were throwing money at something they did not understand in the hopes of making a profit. It sounds familiar because it happened before. The dotcom boom has predicated around similar happenings. People jumped on the bandwagon, not knowing why, and built a huge market on a flimsy base. Those who are not so technologically inclined may have shunned understanding Bitcoin as a new wave of technology, and used that as an excuse. But then still, as investors, they should at least be savvy with their assets. In comparison to stocks and bonds, Bitcoin does not hold much water as a good investment asset, especially when considering long-term capital appreciation. True, Bitcoin has increased its value substantially over time, but it lacks a few other facets. In stocks, an investor stakes a claim in the company's net assets, and as the value of the company rises over time, so does the equity. In bonds, individuals essentially loan the company money in return for an agreed upon stream of interest income. Thus, both these options provide future profits and future income and tick the boxes of sound investments. Bitcoin cannot be counted in the same breath as stock and bonds. Having one Bitcoin today does not entitle you to more Bitcoins in the future, nor does it offer the promise of any future cash flow. But in any case Bitcoin shines as a technology. Those who are trying to separate Bitcoin and Blockchain are wrong in doing so, but their premise is right; Bitcoin should be heralded for its potential as a technology. Its use as a decentralized system of money which liberates users from the tyranny and hegemony of the banking system allows for seamless cross-border transfers and disrupts the financial system - these are reasons to celebrate and back Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been likened to the dotcom bubble burst a number of times, and there is probably merit in it. In the dotcom situation, a technology was being used as an investment opportunity as people rushed in to be a part of the bandwagon. That foundation of uninformed get rich quick types in the dotcom boom caused the technology to be almost forgotten about as companies changed their names and did all they could to cash in, including buying with debt. All of these signs have repeated themselves in Bitcoin, and perhaps it is the best thing for it. Those who got into the space for the wrong reasons have quickly gotten out of it. And those who remain, are true to the potential and vision it still has. As old as the adage is, it is worth repeating and highlighting: ���Don���t buy Bitcoin to become an overnight millionaire.��� The reason this needs to be said again is because it will end badly for the individual and for the currency. If like the Internet and all its associated powers today, you believe Bitcoin can change the world, then it is worth buying into today - while it is cheap. If, you are out to make a quick buck, leave this space alone.

Block data from Blockchain.com reveals that a colossal Bitcoin (BTC) transaction worth $2 billion was processed on Monday night. Despite the enormous financial value, the unknown wallet holder only paid 0.00001713 BTC fees equivalent to $0.78.  Although it is unknown what the purpose of this transfer was, or indeed which individual or entity enacted it, what has clearly been showcased is the enormous potential of financial transactions utilizing cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.  However, this is not the first instance of a transaction of this magnitude with minimal fees. Back in August 2020, a Bitcoin transaction worth $1 billion was recorded with a nominal fee of just $4.  Attempts to transfer money of this value in traditional fiat markets would simply be futile. Anchored to anachronistic models, the financial ecosystem stands as a stark outlier to the instantaneous, largely inclusive, modern information services experience. An international fiat transfer often takes one to four working days to process and includes a hefty transaction fee of 1%���3%. For a transaction worth $2 billion, this would come at the cost of between $20 million and $60 million. Alongside this, banks and governments hold central influence over the activity of financial infrastructures, unlike Bitcoin, and as such, arguably threaten the privacy, autonomy and principles of a free market. According to BitInfoChart, the average price of a transaction fee on Bitcoin���s base-layer blockchain stands at 0.000058 BTC ($2.67). This has been a consistent floor level across the last two months but was not been printed before that since the beginning of the market���s bullish surge in October 2020.  For context purposes, the average transaction fee for the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, Ether (ETH), remains several multiples (770%) higher at 0.0061 ETH ($20.44). Technical data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro reveals that Bitcoin surmounted a challenge to reestablish $46,000 on Tuesday morning after registering price lows of $43,380 on Bitstamp in the wake of major market volatility. This bullish sentiment falls in line with an additional data point that reserves of Bitcoin on major cryptocurrency exchanges have recorded new multi-year lows this week ��� akin to the transaction fees ��� levels not witnessed since the inception of the bullish surge in October 2020.	1
Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, believes the network is on the verge of scaling by a factor of 100, predicting the Optimism will release its layer-two solution in the coming weeks. Speaking on the Tim Ferriss podcast, Buterin noted Eth2���s developer are focused on working toward the chain merge with Ethereum, and are confident that layer-two solutions can support the network until sharding is developed.  ���Rollups are coming very soon,��� he said, adding: ���we���re fully confident that by the time that we need any more scaling of that, sharding will have already been ready for a long time by then.��� Rollups are second-layer solutions that process and store transaction data on a designated sidechain, before bundling batches of transactions together onto Ethereum���s mainnet. The solutions are designed to mitigate Ethereum���s scaling woes, where fierce competition for bandwidth on the Ethereum mainnet has resulted in skyrocketing fees. While Eth2 will use sharding to ensure scalability when fully rolled out, Buterin believes rollups will suffice for the mid-term ��� emphasizing rollups could improve Ethereum���s transactional throughput by 100 times: Buterin predicted Optimism will launch their fully Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM,-compatible rollups ���in around a month or so,��� also highlighting significant progress made by Arbitrum on their own EVM-compatible rollups.  Optimism���s rollups are expected to be embraced by some of DeFi���s industry leaders, with commentators speculating that Uniswap���s coming V3 overhaul will utilize it. Aave and Synthetix are expected to be among the first projects to utilize the technology.  ���There was actually simpler rollups that are only capable of processing simple transactions that are exchanging between assets like Loopring, and zkSync,��� he added noting: ���Those rollups have already been running stably for about a year ��� so rollups aren���t even theory. They���ve been a practical part of [the] scalability of Ethereum for a few users for almost a year.��� Last week, Buterin authored a proposal for a system allowing smart contract protocols to directly communicate between one another across different layer-two scaling solutions.	2
Cardano has announced the completion of its Alonzo hard fork, ushering in its long-awaited smart contract functionality. On Monday, IOHK tweeted that the upgrade had been completed successfully at epoch 290, facilitating the creation and execution of smart contracts on the public blockchain for the first time.  Despite celebrating the milestone, Cardano notes that it is still in the ���early days for the project,��� asserting that now is when ���the mission truly begins��� in a blog post published on the same day: The Alonzo fork enables smart contracts to be written for Cardano using Plutus scripts, which the team describes as ���a purpose-built smart contract development language and execution platform using the functional programming language Haskell.��� However, the team has encouraged its community to maintain sensible expectations for Alonzo, stating:  Cardano is a public blockchain that was founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed by his research firm, IOHK.  While Cardano pledged to rival Ethereum���s dominance in hosting decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 applications, the project has garnered criticism for failing to deliver smart contract functionality until now despite launching in September 2017. Dominic Williams, founder of rival platform Internet Computer, slammed Cardano for the amount of time taken for the protocol to launch smart contracts, stating, ���It amazes me that this chain had been in the market for 2 years, and is only just adding support for smart contracts, and people are happy with this progress.��� Cardano also copped flak in early September after the first decentralized application (DApp) to launch on its testnet encountered issues relating to failed concurrent transaction processing.  Outspoken Ethereum maximalist Anthony Sassano tweeted, ���Seriously 6 years of ���peer-reviewed��� research and a $90bil+ market cap later and the first dapp on Cardano can���t even do concurrent transaction processing (aka the very thing you need for DeFi).��� The first dapp went live on Cardano today and ADA fanboys are finally discovering that you can't peer review your way out of fundamental issues. pic.twitter.com/tYQXNcVKGN Cardano has since sought to address the criticism, asserting that DApps built on the protocol ���are not limited to one transaction per block.��� Despite its detractors, the hype for Candano���s upgrades recently drove its native token, ADA, into record highs, with ADA rallying 192% from a local low of $1.06 in late July to tag $3.10 on Sept. 3, according to CoinGecko. ADA is also up more than 1,600% since the start of 2021. However, ADA has since dipped and spent the past week oscillating between roughly $2.30 and $2.80, suggesting many speculators may have bought the rumor and sold the news.	2
Cryptocurrency mining operations in China are reportedly selling mining machines by weight, as opposed to price per unit. This selloff was reported by local Chinese crypto outlet 8BTC Wednesday, Nov. 21, with reference to the cryptocurrency mining pool F2Pool. Cryptocurrency markets experienced widespread decline throughout last week, with Bitcoin (BTC) declining to as low as $4,300 per coin. The decline has resulted in a similar drop in mining profitability and forced Chinese operators to sell their mining devices at a loss, according to 8BTC. The news outlet has reported that the miners are being sold ���by kilo,��� citing a post made by the founder of F2Pool on the Weibo microblogging platform. Crypto miners are reportedly especially eager to sell the older models, including Antminer S7, Antminer T9, and Avalon A741, as these have reached their ���shutdown price.��� According to local Chinese outlet Tencent News, the earnings from mining are no longer enough to cover electric power and other associated costs. The market slump has reportedly affected mostly small and medium-sized mining operations in the Chinese regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. There, 8BTC reports, some mining machines are being sold on the second-hand market for merely 5 percent of their original value. A mining machine bought at a price of up to 20,000 yuan ($2,885) a year ago is reportedly currently sold for just 1,000 yuan ($144). Bitcoin���s price has kept falling, along with the rest of the crypto market, since the hard fork network upgrade of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that took place Nov. 15. The update has led cryptocurrency exchanges around the world to suspend BCH trading and withdrawals. Earlier this month, Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain announced plans to reach out to local mining farms in the coal-rich province of Xinjiang, and deploy around 90,000 Antminer S9 devices in the region. Bitmain���s move is reported to be a strategic one in the computing ���power war��� associated with the BCH hard fork. At press time, the crypto markets have calmed down, with most of the top ten cryptocurrencies seeing only mild losses. BTC has today hovered between $4,450 and $4,630. In September, the CEO of F2Pool published an infographic that indicated that if Bitcoin price would reach lower than 36,792 Chinese yuan (about $5,376), mining the cryptocurrency with an Antminer T9 would become unprofitable. In the case of an S7 model miner, the break-even point amounted to a significantly higher Bitcoin price point of about 79,258 yuan (about $11,581).	0
A driver who held $5 in Bitcoin (BTC) as a tip for his pizza delivery services has reportedly resurfaced after seven years. According to a post from Redditor btcbible, the Bitcoiner ordered a pizza on Dec. 28, 2013 and gave the delivery driver two options for his tip: a $5 bill, or 0.0069 BTC on a paper wallet. The value was roughly the same at the time, given the price of the crypto asset was $774.  However, the driver reportedly contacted btcbible this week for help on getting the funds into a hot wallet. With Bitcoin���s recent rise to a new all-time high of more than $58,000, the BTC is now worth roughly $400, an increase of more than 7,000% since the pizza was delivered hot. "I let the pizza guy choose between $5 in fiat or BTC," said btcbible. "Needless to say, he chose wisely. I've responded with instructions on how to import the private key via Electrum." The Redditor clarified that they were "not Bitcoin rich," having liquidated the majority of their funds last year to buy a home. The Redditor said at the time that the driver "had heard of bitcoin from the news and grasped the general concept of it" but was "obviously still very new to it." The Reddit post is a reminder of one of the most iconic stories in the crypto space from Bitcoin's beginnings. The first documented commercial purchase using BTC was an order for two pizzas in May 2010, when a programmer paid 10,000 BTC ��� now worth roughly $580 million ��� for a Bitcoin Talk forum user to send him two pies from a Papa John's store in the United States. The most recent Reddit post says that btcbible gave the delivery driver 0.05 BTC, or roughly $2,900 at the time of publication. Cointelegraph reached out to the Redditor for comment, but did not receive a reply.	1
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum���s Ether (ETH) plunged by 13% and 21%, respectively, within minutes on Aug. 2. The move liquidated more than $1 billion worth of futures contracts as BTC/USD dropped from around $12,000 to as low as $10,550.  BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Tradingview There appear to be two main reasons behind the sudden cascade of liquidations. First, the volume in the cryptocurrency market tends to drop during weekends. Second, the market was heavily swayed to longs or buyers.  Cryptocurrency market snapshot, Aug. 2. Source: Coin360 The cryptocurrency market tends to see large liquidations during the weekend. The liquidity often drops as there are fewer active traders in the market. Lower volume leads to massive price movements, as cryptocurrencies become more vulnerable. Mass liquidations become more likely during the weekend because one large liquidation could trigger a cascade of liquidations. When a long contract gets liquidated, as an example, it forces the buyer to market sell, causing selling pressure. As hundreds of millions of dollars worth of long contracts began to get liquidated, Bitcoin and Ether dropped rapidly. Bitcoin declined from $12,000 to $10,600 within 15 minutes, while ether declined from $417 to $300. But mass liquidations happened several times in the past five months. Most notably, on the so-called ���Black Thursday��� on March 13, $1 billion worth of liquidations occurred. Similarly, right before the halving on May 11, the price of Bitcoin dropped to $8,100 resulting in mass liquidations. In the last several days, especially after Bitcoin���s upsurge above $11,000, the cryptocurrency market was heavily swayed to the side of the buyers. The funding rates of Bitcoin and Ether were nearing levels that are not sustainable over a prolonged period. Futures exchanges, like BitMEX and Binance Futures, utilize a mechanism called ���funding��� to implement balance in the market. When the overwhelming majority of market participants are holding long contracts, then short holders are incentivized with a fee and vice versa. Prior to the drop, the funding rate of Bitcoin was hovering at around 0.0721%. Since the average funding rate of BTC is at around 0.01%, the market was dominated by long contracts. The market imbalance was even worse for Ether. The ETH funding rate was at 0.21%, which indicates significant bullish bias. But after the liquidations, the predicted funding rate of ETH is at 0.19%. It suggests that ETH longs were not flushed out, unlike Bitcoin.  Ether funding rate across major futures exchanges. Source: Skew Michael van de Poppe, a trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, previously anticipated Ether to drop to $300 as a result. He said: ���Let���s see $ETH at $300-320.��� For now, some traders anticipate sideways action for the days ahead as Bitcoin has rebounded to a key support level at $11,300 and a CME futures gap will likely emerge on Monday given Friday���s close price of $11,630. ���The bullish scenario depends on the crucial threshold of $11,300-11,400 as the pivot to hold for the price of Bitcoin,��� Van de Poppe explained in his latest BTC technical analysis.  In the medium-term, meanwhile, there is increasing optimism about the price trend for Bitcoin. When asked whether BTC will hit a new all-time high, Spartan Black���s Kelvin Koh said: ���Without a doubt. BTC hit a new ATH in each of the last 3 cycles and this one will be no exception. The scarcity effect, the halving and more capital coming into crypto will ensure that.���	0
Ethereum���s native cryptocurrency Ether has surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time, achieving a new all-time high merely five days into 2018. The recent surge in Ether price and the market valuation of the Ethereum Blockchain network can be largely attributed to two main factors: the abrupt surge in the value of Ripple (XRP) and the rising user activity of decentralized applications. In late December of 2017, Ripple overtook Ethereum for the first time in history, becoming the third alternative cryptocurrency with the exception of Ether and Bitcoin Cash to become the second largest cryptocurrency in the global market behind Bitcoin.  As Cointelegraph previously reported, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market, which has accounted for nearly 50 percent of global Ripple trades over the past week, pushed the market valuation of Ripple from $40 bln to $120 bln within less than a month. The recent rally of Ethereum can be seen as its highly anticipated long overdue recovery and the early signs of competition against Ripple. Merely two days ago, Ripple became the first alternative cryptocurrency to surpass the $100 bln mark. Yesterday, on Jan. 4, the Ethereum network achieved a $100 bln market cap as well. Currently, the Ethereum Blockchain network processes more transactions than all of the Blockchain networks in the global market combined, including Bitcoin. According to EtherScan, the Ethereum network is settling nearly 1.4 mln transactions on a daily basis, which is substantially higher than that of the Bitcoin Blockchain network, which settles 420,000 transactions per day. Charlie Lee, former Coinbase executive and Litecoin creator, noted that transaction volume and user activity are important factors investors must consider in analyzing the performance and future trend of cryptocurrencies. In the two categories, Ethereum is in an optimal position to surge in value. As you can see, Litecoin is doing very well in terms of growth in usage. This chart shows the growth in the past year compared to other coins.   Let's not let price distract us from what's actually important. This is what I mean by conflict of interest. No LTC, no distraction. pic.twitter.com/uYHNshho5s In consideration of the two above mentioned categories, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who has been an active advocate of cryptocurrencies and long-term investor, stated that Ethern price has the potential to increase by threefold by the end of 2018. Already, since November when Novogratz predicted Ether price to triple, Ether price has doubled. "Ethereum, which I think just touched $500 or is getting close, could be triple where it is as well.��� Cointelegraph also reported that decentralized applications on the Ethereum network such as CryptoKitties and EtherDelta have started to gain massive popularity and users. In the future, the emergence of Ethereum decentralized app browsers that will operate as app marketplaces like Google Play Store and Apple App Stores will drive the adoption of decentralized applications, improving the accessibility of the Ethereum network. ���To imagine the current structure of Ethereum���s decentralized application market, one has to consider the mobile app era prior to the existence of Google Play Store and Apple App Store. At that time, users had to download apps from websites directly from the distributors and developers.��� If decentralized app browsers become adopted at a larger scale and the Ethereum network scales, analysts like Novogratz see Ether price surging from its current level.	2
The SENS Research Foundation, a charity funding research for treating-age related diseases, has received a $2.4 million Ether donation from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, according to a press release on the charity���s website Friday, Feb. 1. The foundation was co-founded in 2009 by Aubrey de Grey, a gerontologist who is researching rejuvenative therapies to extend people���s biological ages, hoping to permit humans to live much longer than ever before. Buterin, who is quoted in the press release as a ���fan of Aubrey���s work since [he] first read Ending Aging [de Grey���s book] as a teenager���, also said: ���I am happy to have been blessed with the opportunity to personally support SENS's efforts. Their focus on creating solutions to the diseases of aging, one of the greatest problems facing humanity, is very much in line with my goal to positively impact the lives of millions of people around the world.��� The SENS Research Foundation has already received two large donations totaling $2 million in Bitcoin (BTC) from the anonymous Bitcoin-only charity fund, Pineapple Fund ��� the first million dollars in December 2017 and another $1 million in BTC on Feb. 2.	2
A second day of losses throughout cryptocurrency markets is giving would-be traders a chance to buy that may not be repeated. Bitcoin dropped below $10,000 on Cointelegraph���s price index Wednesday, Jan. 17. On the same day, Ethereum (ETH) went below $900, marking a price slide of over 30% for both assets this week. Community and industry figures have reacted with mixed emotions to the downturn, which mimics behavior seen in January over the past three years. ���Unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50% without becoming panic-stricken, you should not be in the stock market.��� ��� Warren Buffett.

If #Bitcoin was a bus. pic.twitter.com/mcDcj0Cvf5 Data shows that Bitcoin set its annual low in the second week of January for 2015, 2016 and 2017: 2015 - Low was Jan 15  2016 - Low was Jan 16  2017 - Low was Jan 12  2018 - Low .... Across major altcoin markets, assets are also currently being traded at steep discounts versus just a week ago, when many were still beating all-time highs in USD.  The slide against fiat is fuelling a fresh round of mainstream media speculation Wednesday, meanwhile, with various publications hinting at the possibility of Bitcoin���s alleged ���bubble��� having burst. ���Did Bitcoin just burst?��� Bloomberg writes citing analysts who compare current price performance to historical commodity bubbles. A curious U-turn in the industry came from highly-critical CNBC. Even as prices had fallen 20% Tuesday, the network came out with a piece explaining why Bitcoin ���skeptics��� were ���wrong��� to suggest it has no value. ���Many people think that bitcoin is a bubble, and that's predicted on the concept that bitcoin has no value. But there's reason to believe that that just isn't true,��� CNBC���s article concludes. ���By definition, bitcoin is scarce. And the cryptocurrency may have utility as a superior way to store and exchange wealth.���	1
According to Shark Tank���s Robert Herjavec, Bitcoin is ���here to stay��� in the long term, cryptocurrency will definitely be regulated, and investors should both get in and get out now, according to an interview with financial news outlet TheStreet. While Herjavec says that he himself is not an investor in crypto, he predicts that Bitcoin���s price will continue to rise in the short term, even above the January high of 20,000: ���It���ll take out that high, I���m saying it right now.��� He believes that cryptocurrencies should and will be regulated, and that as firm regulation becomes closer to reality, the price of Bitcoin will continue to speculate but then drop way down.  Based on this idea, while maintaining that Bitcoin is around for the long term, Herjavec tells TheStreet that ���I don���t know if you want to own Bitcoin right now. I think you want to get in, and you want to get out,��� a mentality that is opposed to the traditional crypto geek���s desire to ���hodl,��� that is hold onto your coins. Besides Shark Tank, Herjavec is the CEO of the cybersecurity firm the Herjavec Group. When asked about the security of cryptocurrencies, Herjavic doesn���t think that crypto exchanges themselves are ���prone to great security,��� referencing the hack of over $500 mln in NEM from the Japanese-based crypto exchange Coincheck last month, but that cryptocurrency transactions are secure. In answer to a question about the future of Blockchain, Herjavic thinks that Blockchain shows a lot of promise because of its ���inherent security of a transaction.��� He predicts that 10 years down the line, due to the power of Blockchain: ���I will walk somewhere and a sensor will automatically know it���s me, the sensor will be linked to my bank, it���ll know how much money I have, I���ll pick up something like at the Amazon store, it���ll automatically be scanned, and as I leave, it will automatically be verified and paid for.���	0
In the mad mania for cryptocurrencies, there are some dissenting voices from old timers, calling this irrational exuberance. Could a crypto winter be in the offing? A year after the block reward halving, with media buzzing about Bitcoin, and a multifold increase in price - this is not just a description of 2017 but also perfectly fits 2013. After the block reward halving in 2012, the price of Bitcoin shot up during the following year. The price increased from around $13 at the starting of 2013 to a peak of over $1200. The reasons for this jump are manifold (including the bots  - Willie and Markus, which bought Bitcoins on Mt. Gox), but the almost 100 fold increase in price was unprecedented. The 500% increase in price of Bitcoin in 2017 appears tame in comparison. Of course, the base effect does make such 100 fold increases in price almost impossible now, with Bitcoin's market capitalization crossing $100 Bn. When comparisons to 2013 are made, the common refrain is ���this time is different.��� There is increased Bitcoin adoption, there is no Mt. Gox, the ecosystem is better developed, institutional money is coming in and so on. If time has taught us one thing, it is that history usually repeats itself. Or rather, as Mark Twain said, ���History doesn���t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.��� A 500% increase in price in just a year is the sign of a bubble building up. There has been no catalyst driving the growth and a fear-of-missing-out mentality seems to be at play. Newbies are being attracted to Bitcoin (and ICOs) driven by the promise of massive gains. They believe that "this time is different." While traditional economists believe that the market is made up of rational investors, behavioural economists believe otherwise. People who have made windfall profits take higher risks than they normally would. This is similar to gamblers taking higher risks after winning, believing that they are playing with "house money." With Bitcoin's rapid rise in price this year, a lot of investors have seen their portfolio appreciate rapidly in price. Rather than evaluating whether Bitcoin is overvalued and it is time to sell, these investors may be willing to hold longer because of their windfall profits. The crash of 2013 was the first long term downtrend in Bitcoin's price. Although there were previous crashes with higher percentage drops (from $32 to $2), this was the first time that the price didn't recover quickly. Bitcoin's price had risen during every calendar year until 2013 and people believed the price would recover in 2014. This was not to be. It would take more than three years for the price to cross the $1200 levels attained in November 2013. This year has been extremely strong so far, but a crash would be terribly painful. A lot of recent cryptocurrency converts could get hurt and it could take even longer to recover this time.	1
In a podcast for Lend Academy recorded Nov. 5, RippleNet general manager Asheesh Birla called Bitcoin (BTC) a ���pretty innovative alternative to gold,��� but added that 2020 had shown there was room for a lot of tokens in the crypto space.  Birla said that he believed Bitcoin had not ���gone after��� payments, and because different projects had different use cases, the coin���s overwhelming dominance was no longer a certainty: ���I think that the days when folks believed that there���s only going to be Bitcoin, I think, are over. I think it���s clear that there���s gonna be a lot of digital assets and there���s gonna be a lot more traditional assets that are gonna be tokenized as digital assets.��� The RippleNet GM made the comments when the price of XRP was roughly $0.25. It has since tripled, surging to $0.92 last week before crashing 30% amid a wider market rout.  Despite the lack of movement in XRP at the time, Birla added he was feeling bullish over the crypto space coming back ���red hot again��� after the 2018 crash. ���I don���t see the traditional venture capitalists as interested as they were in 2017,��� he said. ���But in my mind I couldn���t be happier in terms of innovation in the space.��� Both Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and CEO Brad Garlinghouse have recently expressed frustration at the lack of regulatory clarity for Ripple in the United States. Last month, SBI Holdings CEO and Ripple board member Yoshitaka Kitao said that the blockchain-based payments may be considering relocating its headquarters to Japan. Larsen believes authorities in the U.S. have a ���regulation through enforcement��� policy and are ���woefully behind��� in preparing for the cryptocurrency-based next generation of a global financial system. At the time of publication, the price of XRP is $0.61, having dropped 3% in the last 24 hours.	1
It took just seven days for the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem to spiral down as prices came crashing from $85 on May 5 to nearly $0 on Thursday. As the market slowly gained clarity on what transpired, the trading volume of LUNA saw a steep recovery of over 200% over the weekend. As a result of TerraUSD (UST) de-pegging, which crashed the LUNA market, LUNA investors mirrored the price dip as CoinGecko recorded the decline of trading volumes to $178.6 million on Friday ��� a number that was last seen in February 2021. Terraform Labs CEO and co-founder Do Kwon sought damage control on the same day as he proposed a revival plan for Terra���s comeback, which involves compensating UST and LUNA holders for holding the tokens during the crash.  Despite the risks involved, Terra���s ���insane volatility��� still serves as an attractive market for many short-term investors ��� mainly due to the fact that LUNA momentarily gained 600% in value on Saturday. (only need a few more 100x's to get back to $1) As investors try to recoup their losses while others attempt to cash in on Terra���s comeback, the trading volume of LUNA surged over 200% back to $6 billion. Before the crash, the LUNA ecosystem consistently recorded over $2 billion in trading volumes on average over the past two years. However, right when LUNA prices tumbled between May 10 and May 13 morning, its trading volume surged as investors attempted to reduce their losses ��� ranging from $5 billion to $16 billion. At its peak, LUNA���s trading volume recorded an all-time high of $16.15 billion on May 11. Due to the various factors stated above, LUNA regained its trading volume and trades at $0.00025 at the time of writing. According to data from CoinMarketCap, crypto exchange Binance represents 68.26% of LUNA���s trading volume, followed by KuCoin at 9.52% and FTX at 1.13%. On Friday, Crypto.com users raised concerns about LUNA trades being reversed on the exchange���s mobile application.  Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, later revealed that an internal error caused the system to display incorrect prices, which led to numerous investors cashing in 30-40x profits. There was a lot of customers who were buying at wrong prices and of course some also jumped onto the opportunity to exploit the glitch to the maximum.We reversed ALL trades. Some customers saved a ton of $ and are thanking us, some didn���t abuse the glitch and are bashing us. As a result, Crypto.com temporarily blocked all users from trading. After a day���s review of the supposed system glitch, Marszalek informed everyone that ���all user accounts have been re-enabled.���  As Cointelegraph reported, the company has offered $10 worth of its in-house token Cronos (CRO) as a goodwill gesture for affected investors.	1
The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. A bullish rumor doing the rounds was that the Chinese ban on bitcoin trading is likely to be lifted. That news boosted Bitcoin���s price higher yesterday. However, a parting message by Huobi poured cold water on the expectations. As a result, Bitcoin prices are correcting from their highs. While Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, and a few others are warning of a bubble in Bitcoin, the legendary investor Bill Miller is smiling away to the bank. His fund is up 70% this year. Miller had invested about 30% of his fund���s assets in Bitcoin in early-2016. Elsewhere, a few central banks are trying to stifle the use of Bitcoin by banning it. Nevertheless, the beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they are not controlled by anyone. The market shall decide the value. Though the ban might make it difficult to use Bitcoin in the marketplace, it is unlikely to affect trading activity. Bitcoin has rebounded sharply from the trendline support and is attempting to breakout of the ascending channel. On Sunday, the cryptocurrency broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel, but could not sustain it. Though the ascending channel has been a stiff resistance and the RSI is also showing a negative divergence, we believe that if the digital currency again breaks out of the channel, it is likely to gain momentum and rally towards its target objective of $6845. Therefore, we recommend a buy at $6400 with a close stop loss of $6000. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please use only 30% of the usual allocation. If the cryptocurrency fails to breakout and sustain above the resistance line of the ascending channel, it can again fall to the trendline support. It will become negative, only if it breaks down of the trendline support and the 20-day exponential moving average, which is at $5623. Ethereum continues to trade in a range. It has still not been able to breakout of the overhead resistance at $315.  If the cryptocurrency breaks out of the resistance at $315, chances are that it will start a new uptrend. This time, we expect ethereum to breakout of $353 and head higher towards $366 levels. Therefore, we recommend a buy on Ethereum at $319 with a stop loss of $289. Partial profits can be booked at $350 levels and the stop loss on the remaining position can be trailed higher. On the other hand, if the digital currency fails to break out of the range, a fall to the trendline is likely. Ethereum will become negative if it breaks down and sustains below the trendline. Therefore, we recommend a buy, only on a breakout. Traders who initiated long positions on our recommendation would have earned a quick 22% return within a day. They would have entered at $422 and exit at the target objective of $518 on October 29. Bitcoin Cash broke out of the range on October 28 and has been sustaining above it since then. This is a bullish sign. Next, the cryptocurrency is likely to rally to $549 levels, where it can face some resistance, but if the bulls��� breakout of this overhead resistance, a move to $700 is possible. We, however, don���t find any reliable buy set up at the current levels, which offers us a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we don���t recommend any long position at the current levels. We shall wait for a small consolidation to re-establish the positions. Ripple has still not triggered our buy levels. It continues to trade in a tight range. The longer it trades in this range, the farther it will run when it starts a new uptrend or downtrend. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation on Ripple at $0.22, on a breakout above the moving averages. The stop loss should be kept at $0.19659. The breakout is likely to carry the digital currency to $0.23955 and $0.25311 levels, which are 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $0.29699 to $0.18211. Traders should raise their stops to breakeven once the cryptocurrency rallies to $0.23955. We suggest booking partial profits at $0.25311. The stop loss on the remaining position should be trailed higher. If the breakout fails to sustain, ripple is likely to remain range bound for a few more days. It will become negative only on a breakdown below $0.18211. Litecoin has still not closed above the range of $44 to $57.7. Therefore, our buy levels from the previous analysis have still not triggered.   Litecoin continues to consolidate near the upper end of the range, therefore, we are modifying our previous buy recommendation. We, now, recommend buying Litecoin at $59 with a stop loss of $53. Our profit objective remains $71, where we recommend booking 50% profits. The remaining position can be held with a trailing stop loss because if the digital currency breaks out of $71, it can rally to $82 levels. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout and sustain above the range, it can again fall towards the $51 levels.	1
Researchers from Chinese Cybersecurity company 360Netlab has discovered a new Android-based cryptocurrency mining malware that infects vulnerable Android devices to mine cryptocurrency, as reported in a blog post from the firm on Feb. 6.  As 360Netlab reports, the ADB.Miner worm scans can affect any kind of Android device, including smartphones, tablets, and television sets. The malware infects the device to mine Monero (XMR) coins and sends all acquired funds to a single wallet.  According to 360Netlab���s blog post, the cryptocurrency mining worm ADB.Miner has been actively infecting devices since Feb. 5, managing to infiltrate 7,000 Android devices, mainly in China and South Korea. The researchers emphasize that the ADB.Miner���s spreading speed is high, the number of scanned devices doubling every 12 hours.  The malware is being spread using the publicly accessible Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on an opened port 5555, which is normally closed. At the current stage of the research, the the security specialists claim that they ���have no idea about how and when this port was opened���. Last week Cointelegraph reported about another case of malware mining Monero, the Smorinru botnet, which has managed to mine over 9,000 Monero coins since May 2017. Previously, on Jan. 26 Monero-mining malware attacked users��� PCs via online ads serving Coinhive code, which affected large number of users and websites worldwide.	0
The UK���s Royal Mint, the institution responsible for producing all the physical money the country has for circulation, has announced the launch of its own gold-backed cryptocurrency. The Blockchain-based coin, called Royal Mint Gold (RMG), is a digital representation of gold stored in The Royal Mint vault. The Royal Mint Bullion, the Royal Mint company that sells physical gold, is the first company to allow customers to hold gold-backed assets on Blockchain, Tom Coghill, RMG���s Commercial Lead, stated in an interview with Express.co.uk. Coghill also mentioned that one RMG coin is equal to one gram of gold, adding that ���it���s real gold you���re holding when you���re holding our RMG.��� A recent report published by the World Gold Council (WGC) compared Bitcoin and gold, declaring that though Bitcoin saw a higher growth in value in 2017, gold would remain an important store-of-value investment. Coghill claimed that Bitcoin investments are more uncertain than investments in gold: ���Gold has probably had an argument that it���s been a store of value for 6,000 years, bitcoin���s a bit younger and the future of bitcoin is uncertain.��� The RMG project was first unveiled by the Royal Mint in December 2016. The UK is not the only country to create a precious metals-backed cryptocurrency. Last week local sources in Australia reported that the country���s largest precious metal refinery, Perth Mint, was set to develop its own cryptocurrency backed by physical precious metals.	2
This week, $534 mln worth of XEM, the native cryptocurrency of NEM, was stolen from a major Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck. On January 27, merely hours after the hacking attack was announced, developers behind NEM created an automated tagging system to track down the funds stolen by hackers. As Cointelegraph reported on January 26, $534 million worth of XEM were stolen from low security hot wallet that lacked multi-signature security measures. During a press conference covered by Cointelegraph, Coincheck executives stated that all of the funds were stored in a hot wallet or an online wallet, which left user funds vulnerable to the security breach. Shortly after the press conference, NEM representatives and its open-source development community firmly opposed the idea of conducting a hard fork to prevent user funds on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange from being recovered. A hard fork could have been executed if $534 million in NEM were stolen due to the fault of the NEM blockchain. But, because the security breach was caused by the lack of strong security measures of Coincheck, the NEM development team rightfully refused to conduct a hard fork. Instead, the NEM development team created an automated tagging system to ensure that all funds stolen from Coincheck are traced. By tagging stolen funds as tainted funds, cryptocurrency exchanges can now easily verify if stolen NEM funds are withdrawn or deposited to regulated trading platforms. ���Hack update: NEM is creating an automated tagging system that will be ready in 24-48 hours. This automated system will follow the money and tag any account that receives tainted money. NEM has already shown exchanges how to check if an account has been tagged. So the good news is that the money that was hacked via exchanges can't leave,��� said a NEM spokesperson. During an interview, NEM Foundation vice president Jeff McDonald confirmed the development of the tagging system and the work NEM Foundation will lead in the next few weeks to prevent stolen funds from being cashed out or converted to other cryptocurrencies through trading platforms. As of now, the hackers behind the Coincheck NEM security breach are out of options. It is not possible for the hackers to convert the stolen NEM to other major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum because the automated tagging system will immediately alert exchanges about the tainted funds. Due to the sheer size of the stolen funds, it is also not likely that the hackers will go through small-scale cryptocurrency exchanges to convert or launder the stolen funds. At this stage, the only safe option for the hackers is to hold onto the stolen NEM. Because of the technology NEM has developed in light of the recent Coincheck hack, it has become significantly difficult for the hackers to do anything with the funds. It is not possible to cash out the stolen NEM to fiat currencies like the US dollar and it is also not possible to convert the stolen funds to other cryptocurrencies. NEM, its open-source development community, and the NEM Foundation did not have to develop the tagging system for the benefit of Coincheck, specifically because stolen funds on the NEM blockchain network would still have circulated around the network even if they are not recovered. But, NEM developers have done Coincheck and investors that lost millions of dollars in the hacking attack a tremendous favor by voluntarily creating a solution to a serious problem.	1
U.S. rapper T.I., also known as T.I.P., is being sued for $5 million by a group of people after his FLiK token has reportedly failed, according to court documents obtained by U.S. celebrity news media The Blast. As per the lawsuit cited by the outlet, the group of 25 persons claims that they have invested $1.3 million in ���now worthless securities called FLiK Tokens,��� promoted by T.I. and his business partner Ryan Felton. The plaintiffs state that the token was actively endorsed in social media both by celebrities and experts to create an impression of  ���a valuable liquid investment.��� However, the group continues, T.I. and Felton defrauded them by using the money raised to drive the token���s price up, and when the prices fell down, they dumped the FLiK and disappeared. According to the lawsuit, Felton even created a new company, stating it had acquired FLiK and telling investors he had nothing to do with it. Now the plaintiffs want to obtain a minimum of $5 million in damages from T.I. and Felton. The lawyer for the celebrity did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter to The Blast. The FLiK was announced back in September 2017 and also actively supported by U.S. actor Kevin Hart, who promoted the coin on his Twitter. As U.S. tabloid TMZ reports, the promo campaign also mentioned Mark Cuban ��� a billionaire and owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. According to the stats provided by CoinMarketCap, the coin was traded at its peak on Oct. 17, 2017, when its price reached 21 cents. Seeing a brief takeoff in February, it slowly declined to nothing, traded at $0.001 as of press time. Celebrities have often become involved in crypto-related activities from time to time, but their attempts and promotions do not always succeed. For instance, another U.S. rapper Ghostface Killah ��� a member of renowned Wu Tang Clan ��� co-founded an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that hoped to raise up to $30 million. However, his Cream Capital was later suspended ���with no plans to hold the token sale in the future.��� Floyd Mayweather, one of the world���s famous boxers and the highest paid athlete of his discipline, also engaged in an ICO, dubbing himself as Floyd ���Crypto��� Mayweather. Later in 2018, one of the coins he backed, Centra, was charged with fraud by U.S. securities watchdog SEC. Another celebrity to recently join a crypto startup was Johnny Depp, who partnered with crypto-powered social entertainment platform TaTaTu. Cointelegraph reported in mid-October that the American movie star is going to team up with the TaTaTu founder in order to jointly create and produce film and digital content.	0
Banking group Santander will be partnering with Ripple to release an international money transfer app using Ripple���s Blockchain xCurrent and RippleNet platforms, Business Insider reports today, March 24. When speaking about the upcoming app release at the International Fintech conference in London yesterday, March 23, Nathan Bostock, the UK CEO of Santander said: ���This spring, if not [sic] one beats us to it, we will be the first large retail bank to carry out cross-border payments at scale with Blockchain technology.��� At the end of January of this year, Ana Botin, the CEO of Santander, had mentioned the app launch in the company���s 2017 earnings presentation, noting that it will be open to Spain, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Poland.  According to Business Insider, Santander had invested in Ripple in 2015 and 2016. The two companies tested an international payment app with test trials in 2016 that showed that Ripple���s technology concluded transfers in less than a day. The payment app will also be able to show an estimate of the cost of a money transfer. So far this year Ripple has partnered with MoneyGram to speed fiat settlements, a consortium of 61 Japanese banks for creating an instant domestic payments app, and a South Korean bank for ���commercial��� international remittances, among others.	2
As Bitcoin continues to become far more commonplace in everyday life, more people are starting to sell lucrative items for virtual currency. The housing market is slowly adopting Bitcoin as a payment method, a number of online platforms accept virtual currencies and you can even buy games on Steam. It seems this also applies to collectors items, including luxury vehicles. A Manchester car owner has listed his Gold Rolls-Royce Ghost for sale on Autotrader, but his asking price is not in pounds but in Bitcoin. A brand new Rolls-Royce Ghost is valued at over ��230 000 - but with just under 50,000 km on the clock, you could snap this up for the equivalent of ��117,000 in Bitcoin. According to the Daily Mail, the owner is happy to be paid in Bitcoin, which has been on a massive bull run culminating in a $12,000 high this week: ���Why not trade in Bitcoin? I treat it in exactly the same way as normal currency these days. It���s safe, convenient and incredibly valuable right now so, to me, it makes sense to trade my car this way. It���s the future.��� The 2010 Ghost Model also comes with a personalized number plate - for an added fee. Complete with a 6.6-liter engine, the Gold car is as luxurious as its price tag.  The most mind-boggling thing about this sale is that if you had bought ��12,000 worth of Bitcoin at the beginning of 2017 and held onto it - you would be able to buy golden Rolls-Royce. As the world gears up for launch of Bitcoin futures in the coming weeks, the demand for the virtual currency is bound to grow. Whether or not people decide to hold onto their Bitcoin or sell, there will be a flood of people looking to get into the market. With more people wanting Bitcoin, we���re likely to see more ���everyday��� transactions made with the virtual currency. Why not sell more items for Bitcoin as the value of the currency grows?	2
During a Facebook Live interview between Xapo CEO and Paypal board member Wences Casares and PayPal CEO Dan Schulman on Jan. 12, Casares explained his vision of a single ���robust��� Blockchain to move value globally, saying Bitcoin (BTC)���s Blockchain would likely play this role. He also predicted that BTC could become an apolitical standard of value. Casares, who grew up in Patagonia, Argentina, explained during the interview that he had seen his family lose everything three times during his childhood due to banking failures and hyperinflation. He, like many tech pundits, compares the creation of Blockchain technology to the creation of the Internet in terms of its innovative potential. Earlier this year, Casares had predicted that the price of Bitcoin would eventually reach $1 mln. During the Jan. 12 interview, Casares repeated the same prediction, but in a modified form, calling Bitcoin and crypto in general an ���interesting experiment��� and predicting BTC���s $1 mln price if that experiment should succeed: ���I also think that there is a higher than 50% chance that this experiment succeeds...If that happens the world is going to look very very different... I happen to believe that if it succeeds that one bitcoin is going to be worth one million dollars.��� He also said he thinks there is an ���at least a 20 percent chance that this experiment fails���. Casares���s optimistic views on the digital currency, however, are bigger than price gains: ���I can imagine a world in which bitcoin becomes a global standard of value ��� it���s the first global and non-political standard of value ��� coupled with the first global and non-political standard of settlement [...] It would be the biggest leap forward in the democratization of money we���ve ever seen.��� According to Casares, the future of crypto lies in the cooperation around a singular, robust Blockchain, and in his opinion Bitcoin���s is the most likely to be the Blockchain of choice: ���There is a huge incentive to have one very, very robust blockchain. At least for any process that, in the end, will be moving value of any kind [...] There may be other use cases that do not entail value that may merit a different blockchain, but in terms of value, it���s most likely, in my opinion, that we���re going to have one. And right now, the most likely one seems to be the Bitcoin blockchain.��� Casares���s focus on Bitcoin underlines the importance of miners being able to successfully rely on transaction fees as incentives to replace block rewards, once the 21 mln Bitcoin mining cap is reached. 80 percent of bitcoins had already been mined on Jan. 13, leaving 4.2 mln coins left until the supply cap.	2

Major global crypto exchange Binance had confirmed on Nov. 2. they will support the upcoming Bitcoin Cash hard fork, which will take place when ���the median time past [1] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is greater than or equal to UNIX timestamp 1542300000.��� The exchange notified its users that deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin Cash will be suspended starting on Nov. 15, claiming that users should leave enough time for deposits to be processed in ���full prior to this time.��� Meanwhile, tomorrow, Nov. 5, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will face a deadline for reviewing proposed rule changes related to a series of applications to list and trade various Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).	2
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen low volatility throughout the past six weeks, hovering in the $9,300���$9,900 range for most of the time. This has led traders to warn that it is likely to cause a massive price movement in the near term. Over the last 12 months, Bitcoin has seen two extended ranges. One was in June 2019 and the other in December 2019. In both instances, the price of BTC saw a 40% move in the following months. Traders generally foresee two short-term scenarios for the top-ranked digital asset on CoinMarketCap. One is a rejection at $9,200 that will be followed by a fall to the $7,000s, and the other would entail the price holding $9,200 then retesting $10,500 to potentially see the start to a newfound rally. Whichever direction the price heads in the upcoming weeks, analysts anticipate a highly volatile trend for the cryptocurrency market. A technical analyst known as Crypto Birb wrote: ���Consolidating for 1.5 months already. This is going to be a monster move for BTC soon.��� Similarly, Pentarhudi, a Bitcoin trader who predicted the steep downtrend of Bitcoin by as early as February, said BTC is on track to see explosive price action. Pentarhudi explained that the technical structure Bitcoin is now portraying is either a triple top or a range lock.  Bitcoin price sees a triple top on the daily chart. Source: Tradingview The price of Bitcoin rejected at $10,500 in October 2019, February and June. On the daily BTC chart, it created a triple top formation, which typically is a bearish pattern. If the price of Bitcoin continues to fall in the upcoming weeks and confirms that it is a triple top, Pentarhudi warned that BTC could drop to as low as $6,000. The analyst said: ���Triple top on daily... Bearish pattern. Will trigger at close below $8000 with a target to $6000. Either triple top or range lock.��� Bitcoin is also entering a ���fear zone��� on various investor sentiment indices, suggesting traders are becoming increasingly cautious about the short-term trend of BTC.  Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index plotted on a four-hour BTC/USD chart. Source: Byzantine General There are two main variables that may shift the price trend of BTC in June. One is the risk of miners selling more Bitcoin after a difficulty adjustment, and the second is JPMorgan Chase���s surprising praise of the top cryptocurrency. Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase said Bitcoin has ���staying power��� after it survived from its crash to $3,600 in March. It completed a V-shaped recovery by surging above $10,000 within less than three months. At a period where institutional demand for Bitcoin has been rapidly increasing since the start of 2020, JPMorgan Chase���s change in stance toward BTC could bode well for Bitcoin���s future price action. However, the mining difficulty of Bitcoin is set to increase by 13% within the next three days, meaning there will be a significant increase in the cost of mining. This may apply additional selling pressure on the Bitcoin market, amplifying the short-term bearish scenario.	2
The global cryptocurrency community has been abuzz with speculation in the wake of a leaked white paper linked to the popular, encryption-based messaging app Telegram. News of Telegram���s plans to launch a Blockchain platform originally broke in December, although it still remains unclear if the project legitimately exists.   Cointelegraph has reviewed the leaked white paper, which lays out ongoing plans to launch Blockchain services and its very own cryptocurrency using Telegram as a springboard. While the legitimacy of the white paper and its actual association with Telegram has not been confirmed by the Durov brothers, who founded Telegram, the white paper promises some interesting applications to users of the messaging app and wider audiences. With access to 200 mln Telegram users, the developers of the project hope to reach a massive audience with what they are calling the Telegram Open Network (TON). TON is being touted as a scalable multi-Blockchain architecture using a proof-of-stake protocol to address what the white paper describes as major hurdles facing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The white paper cites a lack of capacity to manage high volumes of transactions, unfriendly user applications and a limited market to use cryptocurrencies for goods, content and services as stumbling blocks TON will address. By using Telegram���s massive user base, the developers hope to reach the critical mass required for mass adoption if its services. According to the white paper, the TON Blockchain is ���a scalable and flexible Blockchain architecture that consists of a master chain and up to 292 accompanying Blockchains.��� The various protocols chosen promise to be able to process millions of transactions per second. This will be facilitated by the use of an infinite ���sharding��� paradigm which will allow the Blockchain to split and merge in response to different network loads. Instant hypercube routing will supposedly manage transaction across different Blockchains. Along with a proof-of-stake protocol, the use of 2-D distributed ledgers is said to allow TON to build ���new valid blocks on top of any blocks that were proven to be incorrect to avoid unnecessary forks.��� Once their Blockchain is up and running, TON will launch a number of services with the Blockchain. This will include a data storage service, a virtual private network service, a DNS as well as its very own payment system. The payment system will use TON���s very own cryptocurrency, called Grams. Users will be able to use Grams to pay for content and services that will be provided by Telegram and other decentralized services. Of course, to make all of this a reality, TON will launch a token sale sometime in the first quarter of 2018. There will a total supply of five bln Grams, of which 200 mln (four percent) will be held by the development team in a four-year vesting period. In what is described as a bid to prevent speculative trading, 52 percent of the overall supply will be held in the TON reserve during the initial development and launch. The other 44 percent will be sold using a formula ensuring a steadily rising price per token.  Now that we���ve got through the nitty gritty of the proposed TON ICO, we can discuss the legitimacy of the project and its purported link to Telegram, its founders and developers. Both Nikolai and Pavel Durov, as well as a number of Telegram���s senior developers, are listed in the white paper. However, there has been no official comment from either of the Durov brothers. Nevertheless, there seems to be mixed sentiment on social media. Some users are excited by the promise of a mix of decentralized, encrypted data services linked to TON. You can already find in the internet leaked Telegram ICO white paper, but the most excited part for me that there are TON Storage(aka decentralized Dropbox), TON DNS(friendly account names), TON Proxy(anonymizer) #Telegram #TON #TelegramICO Another user expressed concerns at the initial holding structure of Grams by the development team: @durov Does your team have any clue of how POS works? I'm sure your ICO will do very well, but to be quiet honest in your white paper proposal you're already a threat to "Ton". Coins/Tokens in POS are not to be distributed like a company and holding 52%. What in the world pic.twitter.com/YdgE96fcjp Conversations with a couple of Blockchain and cryptocurrency experts bring to light a number of points to consider. The best way to describe this white paper is ���fun fiction,��� according to ICObench.com advisor Vasily Sumanov. With a massive user base, it���s not hard to see why fans of Telegram would want to see it metamorphosize into something far greater. A state free community with its very own cryptocurrency and linked services - a crypto-utopia of sorts. If this piece of work really is fun fiction, the authors have produced a compelling white paper that promises many things. The sharding technology may not be available in current projects, but it's also not clear if there is a need for a Blockchain that can store that much information. How much space would a node need to store a Blockchain that has 292side chains? The writers have also used good-practice mechanisms in the restriction of available tokens during the initial stage of development, which would chase away speculative investors in favor of long-term capitalists that see real value in the technology. If this ���leaked��� white paper has done anything, it has shown that there is great interest in an ICO that is linked to established applications that provide crucial real-world solutions. Telegram and its creators will no doubt have appreciated the attention, but whether they are actually busy concocting their own legitimate ICO based on Blockchain technology remains to be seen. Sumanov, who also doubles up as an academic researcher, believes the Durov brothers would not leave anything to conjecture, with a guns-blazing announcement if they were truly launching an ICO. ���Really, it is too simple and too ���good.��� I think, that if Durov plans to make an ICO, he will make a public announcement with a really original white paper. Taking into account that Mr. Durov is a libertarian, I believe he will somehow make the integration of his own cryptocurrency and services into Telegram. Will be this done using an ICO or not? Only time will tell,��� Sumanov told Cointelegraph. Conversely, ICOBox founder Mike Raitsyn is far more optimistic about the authenticity of the white paper. Given that the Durov brothers have previously spoken about the possibility of an ICO, Raitsyn says the documents look legitimate. Furthermore, he insists that the success of Telegram and the network it has built could be the catalyst for a truly universal cryptocurrency. ���Despite their revolutionary potential, existing cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum lack the qualities required to attract the mass consumer. The current state of Blockchain technology is very promising, but it is obvious that the market is experiencing an acute need in a mainstream user-friendly cryptocurrency that would attract mass users and employ the full potential of the new technology,��� Raitsyn said. The technology that will power TON is also a first according to Raitsyn, providing unique features like sharding technology which promises to increased speed and scalability to its Blockchain to support a massive user base. The expert isn���t concerned about the grand scale of the project, saying the broad scale of offerings is a natural progression of Blockchain technology. ���TON will be a third generation Blockchain project which would offer vastly superior capabilities to users. TON has been designed as a multi-Blockchain platform, which would meet the growing demand for a platform offering a broad range of services. It will provide speed and scalability, intuitive user interfaces and an engaged use base to exchange value.��� If Raitsyn is correct, the Durov brothers will make announcements later this year to either confirm or deny the legitimacy of this project. Polynom Crypto Capital founder Alexey Ivanov told Cointelegraph that the most crucial part of TON���s plans is the massive Telegram user base. If they make good on their promises, only social media giants could rival them. ���They have almost a 200 mln audience to reach and give them the payment platform. They can only be outdone by Facebook or Google,��� Ivanov said. Meanwhile, adverts promoting the presale of Gram tokens have been seen on Facebook.  On Tuesday, Jan. 16 Pavel Durov sent out a tweet warning people of potential scams around the TON ICO. This is scam. Be careful. However neither one of the Durov brothers have come out with a public statement regarding the TON ICO.	0
Industry executives and famed technical analysts including Morgan Creek CEO Mark Yusko and trader Peter Brandt predict Bitcoin (BTC) to reach $100,000 in the long-term. For that to happen, the top cryptocurrency needs to see consistent accumulation. According to options trader Theta Seek, for the price of Bitcoin to remain stable at that price point, investors need to invest $90 million in BTC every day. The $90 million figure is derived from the total amount of BTC that miners can mine per day. After the 2020 halving, miners can generate up to 900 BTC every day. If the price of Bitcoin reaches $100,000, 900 BTC will be equivalent to $90 million. Data from ByteTree shows miners sold all BTC they mined in the past week, likely to cover operational costs. Given that miners typically sell what they mine on a regular basis, the assumption that the selling pressure on Bitcoin may reach $90 million when BTC hits $100,000 is reasonable. Theta Seek explained that one way to think about the accumulation of such a large amount of Bitcoin is to envision consistent buying demand from retail investors. The trader said: ���At 100K per BTC, the market has to absorb a miner supply of $90 Million USD daily. Assuming that there are 10 million people worldwide buying BTC on a regular basis. It would cost them each $9 daily to sustain those price levels. I've met people who spend more than $9 on coffee.��� The trader added that hodlers���a term used to describe long time Bitcoin holders���have not sold throughout the past three all-time highs of BTC, noting: ���Data suggests otherwise though, HODL-ers throughout the past 3 ATHs have not been selling in significant portions. 60% of BTC has not moved for more than 2 years. Even if that were to be true, the long time supply of BTC will eventually equal the mining (new) supply.��� Market data from Glassnode similarly suggests hodlers have been consistently accumulating Bitcoin ever since the price of BTC flash-crashed to $3,600.  Hodlers accumulated Bitcoin even more as BTC dropped to $3,600 in March. Source: Glassnode In the last eight weeks leading up to the halving, Glassnode researchers explained that hodlers added to their positions with expectations of a higher Bitcoin price post-halving. The absorption of $90 million in daily selling pressure would sustain BTC at $100,000, but not lead to an upsurge to that point. For Bitcoin to hit $100,000, it would need to achieve a market capitalization of $2.1 trillion. That is around 25% of the market cap of gold. In other words, the perception of Bitcoin as an established store of value has to increase and institutional, retail, futures and options market activity will have to reach new levels. Bitcoin has seen some progress in being recognized as a store of value in recent months. JPMorgan became the first major bank to reportedly open accounts for cryptocurrency exchanges and Grayscale saw record institutional activity in the first quarter of 2020.	2
Amid a wild market-wide bullrun for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), an ultra-rare ���alien��� CryptoPunk has sold today for 605 Ether, worth over $750,000 at today���s prices.  CryptoPunks are widely considered to be the original NFT project, released even before Cryptokitties, the blockchain-based collectibles project that propelled NFTs to mainstream consciousness. CryptoPunks developers Larva Labs report that Punks have accounted for $26 million in lifetime sales on their native marketplace, and the average sale price for Punks over the past year has been $6,199. Each Punk has unique attributes, such as background color, accessories, and even some ultra-rare features, such as an ���alien��� or ���zombie��� appearance. The Punk that sold today, #2890, is one of nine alien Punks in existence. Punk 2890 bought for 605 ETH ($761,888.57 USD) by 0x24c5eb from 0x6611fe. https://t.co/p5IvIq3MnB #cryptopunks #ethereum pic.twitter.com/xq8Cl2imKV The bidding for the Punk was competitive throughout the last week, with DeFi megawallet-turn-Twitter personality 0x_b1 putting in a 500 ETH bid. The Punk was last sold in July of 2017 for 8 ETH, meaning the owner made a 75x return on their investment.  The new owners are a group of investors that include FlamingoDAO, a ���NFT collective that supports and collects premium NFTS,��� according to a Flamingo spokesperson. The official FlamingoDAO Twitter handle confirmed the purchase with a meme: pic.twitter.com/BwKa6481hm ���It's simple: Cryptopunks is a groundbreaking project; it pre-dated the ERC 721 standard and crypto kitties,��� said the spokesperson on the investment thesis. ���Aliens are the rarest form of Cryptopunk and we believe that the acquired Alien will be prized by collectors over time and mature into an iconic digital art piece.��� Crypto art collector @gmoneyNFT, who himself dropped 140 ETH on a Punk earlier in the month, thinks that the alien is a fine investment despite the sky-high valuation.  ���I think it was a great purchase. As the world moves more digital, the digital "flex" will be more and more important. It's how humans operate in the physical world. It won't change in the digital realm,��� he said.  Long-derided as a secondary usecase for blockchain, sales like today���s demonstrate that NFTs are just beginning to have their day in the sun. NBA Topshot, a collectible highlight project from Dapper Labs, has proven to be tremendously popular, and Axie Infinity���s native critters have been selling for remarkable prices as of late as well.  Some critics have called into the question the sky-high prices rare NFTs have been fetching, however, arguing that simple digital scarcity is a shaky foundation on which to justify a $750,000 sale. @gmoneyNFT dismisses these criticisms, saying that there are plenty of real-world analogues that make just as much ��� or as little ��� sense.	2
Amid the cryptocurrency market crash, even the newest crypto mining machines are struggling to seal profits for their operators, according to real-time data published by mining profitability data site ASICMinerValue.com (AMV) today, Dec. 11. AMV is a site that calculates real-time profitability rates for ���ASIC��� miners, hardware that uses Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips, tailored to efficiently mine cryptocurrency based on a specific hashing algorithm. Updated every minute, the site calculates profit yields for specific miners based on current power costs, network difficulty, block rewards, and cryptocurrency prices. As of press time, the site indicates that among ASIC mining machines geared to mine coins that are based on cryptographic hash function ���SHA-256��� ������ such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ������ only two are currently making any profit. Both models were released in October 2018, and show $0.58 and $0.21 in daily profits.  ASIC miners tailored for SHA-256-based cryptocurrencies, in order of profitability, Dec. 11. Source: ASICMinerValue.com The currently most profitable machine, the Ebit 11++, was released by Chinese mining hardware manufacturer Ebang Communication and is currently priced at $2,024. As reported just this week, mining manufacturing giant Bitmain has announced it will be closing its development center in Israel and firing local employees, with local reports attributing the decision to ���the current situation��� and ���shake-up��� of the global crypto market. This October, even ahead of the recent market slump, a report from crypto outlet Diar indicated that crypto mining is gradually becoming profitable only for ���big guns,��� whose pockets are ���deep��� enough to subsidize burgeoning electricity costs. A Cointelegraph in-depth report published this November analyzed the impact of the protracted crypto bear market on the mining landscape, including its impact on global sales of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).	1
On Monday, developers of the Ethereum Classic blockchain announced a hard fork to implement the project���s latest version, now scheduled for launch in late July. The upgrade, which the community has dubbed ���Magneto,��� will include the four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) first seen in Ethereum���s Berlin upgrade earlier this year. These proposals are meant to improve the network���s security while saving on gas costs by storing addresses and keys in one place for users to access with a single transaction. Beta testing on Ethereum Classic���s Morder and Kotti testnets began on June 2 and June 9, respectively. The Magneto fork is set to officially occur once these tests have concluded.  Stevan Lohja, developer relations manager at Mantis ��� a full-featured client and wallet for Ethereum Classic ��� told the Ethereum Classic community: Ethereum Classic (ETC) was originally created under rocky circumstances back in 2016. The protocol forked from the Ethereum mainnet due to the $60-million hack of a project known simply as ���the DAO��� ��� an early decentralized autonomous organization. Following the exploit, Ethereum���s developers decided to roll back the malicious transactions in an attempt to circumvent the hacker and return the stolen funds to their proper owners. Some believed that undoing these transactions would in effect override one of Ethereum���s core tenets ��� ���Code is law.��� These users felt that it was better to accept the loss and learn from the engineering mistakes that allowed the hacker to siphon the funds. As a result, the Ethereum Classic project forked away from Ethereum in an effort to preserve what some felt was the most accurate representation of the project���s blockchain. Back in May 2021, some Ethereum Classic enthusiasts jokingly referred to the project as ���the wrong Ethereum��� as the price surged in excess of 300% ��� perhaps due to new crypto traders confusing it for Ether (ETH).	2
The energy consumed by mining ��� the process that keeps Bitcoin���s blockchain running ��� has been an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent weeks. On Friday, CNBC posted an interview with SUKU CEO Yonathan Lapchik, during which he explained the Bitcoin mining scene as it relates to renewable energy. The interviewer noted Lapchik previously claimed that 75% of Bitcoin mining comes from renewable energy. ���We think that 75% is an actual figure,��� Lapchik told CNBC, ���The miners are truly incentivized to use renewable energy." Turning his thoughts to electric car-maker Tesla, which recently announced it would no longer accept Bitcoin for purchases due to environmental concerns, Lapchik said ���It���s surprising that Elon didn���t consider that before getting into the space, before accepting Bitcoin as a payment mechanism for Tesla.��� Tesla opened its doors to payments via Bitcoin by United States clientele back in March. The move went public following the car company���s purchase of $1.5 billion worth of BTC, announced in February.  Musk, however, recently stated disapproval of the fossil fuel energy Bitcoin mining calls on, via a Tweet on Wednesday. He also discontinued payments to Tesla in BTC, albeit seemingly a temporary move until Bitcoin mining reaches satisfactory energy usage levels.  ���Really the data has been there forever,��� Lapchik said of the 75% number. ���We���ve been proving over and over and over that that���s a real case for miners in the Bitcoin network.���	2
In an age where ICOs are the rage and everybody with an idea is rushing to the market to sell tokens and raise money, have you wondered why OpenBazaar doesn���t have a token yet? A recent phenomenon has been the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fund the development of new ideas, based on the Blockchain. These ICOs (or tokens) help the sponsors of a project to fund its development. Of late, there has been a large number of ICOs with questionable ideas/backers who have raised funds. Investors rush to buy these tokens because of the opportunity to make profits once these tokens are listed on exchanges and increase in price. The huge amount of money raised by ICOs is currently under the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC is looking into ICOs and if it decides that these tokens constitute securities, it could lead to a lot more oversight/regulation of these tokens. Currently, there are no disclosure norms followed by ICOs and tokens can be sold to anybody without restrictions. If there indeed is a regulatory crackdown, the market for these tokens would disappear overnight and there would be a huge price correction. OpenBazaar doesn���t need a token to work. It is a protocol, using software to connect people and help them trade without a middleman. It works perfectly well and is able to reach a wider audience with the help of Bitcoins. Using a token would actually restrict its user base and would increase the barriers to entry. While OpenBazaar is looking to add support for other cryptocurrencies and increase its user base, having a token just for OpenBazaar would be counterproductive. Moreover, any regulatory restrictions on tokens would involve huge compliance costs and might require the protocol itself to be changed. While the possibility of OpenBazaar issuing tokens in the future is not ruled out completely, it is expected to happen only when the negatives highlighted have been resolved. The ICO frenzy is not going to last forever. When there is a price correction and investors in these ICOs book losses, the irrational exuberance is going to end. Raising millions of dollars in a matter of hours for any conceivable idea is not going to be possible. Companies could, however, raise money in stages, similar to the traditional equity market where there are initial public offerings and follow-on offerings.	1
While on trip to China for economic talks, South Korea���s Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon spoke positively about the potential for Blockchain, saying that ���Blockchain technology can disrupt and revolutionize the world,��� according to the South Korean-based Yonhap News Agency. During a meeting with Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People���s Bank of China, Yeon also spoke of a need for more cooperation with China on Blockchain technology. According to another Korean news site Chosun, Yeon reiterated that the South Korean Finance Ministry has no plans to ban or restrict cryptocurrencies within the country, adding: ���Blockchain technology is an important technological breakthrough to fuel the fourth industrial revolution and as such, the ministry will take a cautious approach in regulating the cryptocurrency market. For negative use cases of cryptocurrencies, the ministry will impose strict regulations.��� While some have made the case that cryptocurrencies aren���t necessary for still reaping the benefits of Blockchain technology, Yeon sees the two as inextricably linked: ���For open-source blockchain networks, cryptocurrencies are necessary as incentives for individuals to participate in the network.��� Yeon���s positive comments about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies come after a period of harsher restrictions on crypto investing and exchanges in South Korea, with the country���s ban on anonymous trading of cryptocurrencies and a false scare of an overall crypto ban making the markets dip.	1
Josh Althauser is a tech entrepreneur and open source advocate specializing in providing mentorship for startups for their marketing technology. You may connect with him on Twitter. Bitcoin���s value is soaring. Over recent months, the cryptocurrency has hit record highs. In early May of this year, the open-source digital currency ballooned to almost $3,000 a coin. Last May, one coin fetched only $450. By no means is this growth a sudden trend. Bitcoin���s value has been steadily increasing since its inception in 2008, nearly a decade ago. Still, many remain hesitant to invest. The theft of hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins from the now-infamous Mt. Gox may still haunt investors. Or perhaps the volatility, as the Bitcoin market is 26 times more volatile than the S&P 500, and the lack of governmental oversight have speculators forecasting disaster. This is understandable as Bitcoin is not backed by a precious metal, a country or a bank. It���s regulated by sentiment alone. Although there are clear advantages to a market structured like this, there are serious obstacles and dangers that cannot be ignored. If you���re willing to stomach the risk, however, investing in Bitcoin may be a worthwhile endeavor. 1. It���s experiencing incredible growth. The currency suffered greatly due to the theft of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins in 2014, but has recovered quite quickly in the span of two years and is now experiencing rapid growth. In February of this year, Bitcoin surpassed one troy ounce of gold in value. It���s now surpassing the value of gold by even larger margins. If you happened to invest meagerly in Bitcoin in 2011, you would have already seen massive returns. For example, an $100 investment would have garnered you approximately $600,000 if you sold this May. 2. The supply is fixed. 21 mln Bitcoins are scheduled for release. No more, no less. It is likely that every Bitcoin will be in distribution around the year 2140. Each year, the number of Bitcoins slated for circulation is halved, slowing the process significantly. A currency with a fixed supply seems counterintuitive to some. Fiat currency is printed as needed. More money is circulated as time goes on. According to Bitcoin���s website, ���Bitcoin is intended to inflate in its early years and become stable in its later years... With a stable monetary base and a stable economy, the value of the currency should remain the same.��� Although it might be predicted that a lower supply results in hoarding and deflation, this most likely will not be the case for the currency as the fixed supply is expected. 3. Bitcoin may be an effective way to diversify. Investors are beginning to take Bitcoin more seriously. In 2011, Bitcoin was virtually unknown. Now, it regularly appears in the mainstream news. Kiosks devoted to trading Bitcoins have sprung up. Increasingly, digital currency is being used for everyday transactions, international trade and as investment vehicles. Adoption rates have risen and trust in the digital currency has strengthened steadily. Cryptocurrency itself is widening as dozens of competing alternatives based on Bitcoin technology (aptly named altcoins) flood the market. JP Morgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft even came together to back the Blockchain currency Ethereum. ���More and more investors are looking for unique opportunities outside the traditional arena,��� writes Bobby Cho for The Street. ���[B]itcoin is emerging as a viable alternative asset class for institutional and retail investors alike. It has an enormous amount of investment potential and is unlike any investment product in the world today.��� Bitcoin has grown exponentially. But, by the same token, the currency���s upward climb hasn���t been without setbacks. Mt. Gox underscored fears about the mercurial nature of the peer-to-peer currency. Millions of dollars were lost likely due to undetected theft, leaving supporters and skeptics alike with concerns about its security and long-term viability. However, it has taken these losses in stride. The Blockchain currency has surged well over its pre-Mt. Gox market value this year, experiencing two all-time highs in the span of a few months. The original public ledger provides unique opportunities to investors who are willing to steel themselves against downturns and remain calm during record surges. The supply of Bitcoins is fixed, which may stabilize the currency over time. Moreover, faith in Blockchain currency is expanding as giants like JPMorgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft have already shown their support of cryptocurrency. Therefore, Bitcoin is currently experiencing wider adoption and is being taken more seriously as an investment vehicle. If you are serious about adding Bitcoin into your portfolio, you���ll need to exercise caution. When investing in cryptocurrency, you should only risk as much as you���re willing to lose. Continue to conduct your own research, monitor Bitcoin���s growth and assess the currency���s weaknesses. Shrewd investment bolstered by thorough research could, in fact, lead to immense returns.

The European Central Bank (ECB) says it ���expects��� cryptocurrency regulation to be high on the agenda at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires this March. In comments at an event during the ongoing World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos, ECB board member Benoit Coeure added further weight to France���s economy minister Brune Le Maire���s vow to make Bitcoin a topic at the political forum. ���The international community is... preparing an answer to that and I would expect, for instance, the G20 discussion in Buenos Aires in March to focus very much on these issues,��� Coeure said quoted by Reuters. Le Maire had previously expressed a desire to have Bitcoin regulation feature on the G20 agenda, with various entities repeating calls for an international regulatory effort on cryptocurrency during the WEF. British prime minister Theresa May and US Treasury secretary steven Mnuchin both expressed the need to consolidate standpoints, while former US Secretary of State John Kerry told Cointelegraph the technology ���had value��� and that people were thus going to talk about it. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden���s deputy central bank governor has stopped short of calling for heightened control of cryptocurrencies, saying at the WEF they ���don���t meet the criteria to be called money.��� ���They can be called an asset, fine, but they are not a very good version of money because it's not a very stable store of value where they fluctuate a lot,��� she continued adopting a frequent narrative on Bitcoin���s use. ���And it's not a very efficient medium of exchange because you don't buy your groceries with bitcoin.���	2
According to an exclusive report on Blockchain technology blog Modern Consensus, Circle, a multi-currency money-sending app, is reportedly in the works to acquire Poloniex, a major US-based cryptocurrency exchange. Modern Consensus cited two unnamed sources that had information about the potential deal. However, when asked about the reported acquisition of Poloniex, Raj Date, a board member of Circle, told Modern Consensus: ���I can���t comment on anything like that. I���m actually in Europe right now. Thanks for the reach out.��� Ari Paul, the CIO at digital currency hedge fund BlockTower Capital, denied the legitimacy of any deal on Twitter, citing his own source at Circle and calling the Modern Consensus article ���fake news���: I just posted a link to an article asserting that Circle was acquiring Poloniex. Someone helpfully replied that the article was fake news. I confirmed with Circle that the article is not correct. Circle is not acquiring Polo (according to my circle source.) Modern Consensus is a blog founded by Ken Kurson, former editor-in-chief at the New York Observer, that covers technology news in the cryptocurrency and Blockchain spheres. Another twitter user responded to Paul casting doubt on his alleged Circle source, given that Kurson put his reputation at stake in publishing the news: Do you think there is any possibility that your source at Circle is wrong or intentionally denying? Asking because the post on modern consensus is by Ken Kurson, who appears to be someone who would care for their reputation. Kurson cited one of the sources, who he referred to as ���highly placed���, with apparent access to the acquisition discussions as saying: ���Circle and Poloniex agreed to terms and Circle has already approached the regulators. The regulators came back with a list of KYC demands [Know Your Customer] and Circle has agreed to meet all the conditions.��� Both Circle and Poloniex did not respond to Cointelegraph���s requests for comments on the pending deal by press time. Circle, which received $50 mln from Goldman Sachs in a funding round in 2015, contains Circle Pay for fiat transfers, Circle Trade as a liquidity provider of cryptocurrencies, and soon will add Circle Invest, an app allowing retail customers to invest in crypto markets. Poloniex is currently the 14th largest crypto exchange by 24-hour volume on CoinMarketCap, trading a total of almost $300 million on the day to press time. The exchange allows users to trade in 68 different coins, a huge number as compared to Coinbase's popular crypto exchange platform GDAX, which offers only four, but is in 7th place by trading volume. The Poloniex exchange faced problems this year with incorrect user balances and a very slow withdrawal waiting period.	2
As usual there is a massive overreaction from news coming from China. It���s possible to say that the basis of latest announcement that China is banning ICOs and exchanges is unreliable as there has been no formal statement from a government official. The origin of the news was a Google translated article from a Chinese journalist, who apparently had spoken to some official. So the news is three layers from the original source. Last time China banned or wanted to stop Bitcoin, they reversed the situation some months after. Remember, China have many laws preventing capital flight, money leaving China, and we are not used to laws being verbal unsubstantiated statements, from non-government officials. Are some people having an agenda to pump Bitcoin and spook the market? This news may actually be doing everyone a favour, as it is likely to be the last time you can buy Bitcoin at these levels. We have just had it gifted to us, a 30 percent return as BTC will dipped below $4000 and then returned to business as usual. Bitcoin isn���t the issue here. It���s Ether, which is largely the hub of the ICO community, that is likely to take a pounding, with the Ethereum network struggling to keep pace with demand. ICOs are, after all, the pump for Ether, and it is likely that ETH will continue to rise for the time being. Many ICOs are founded on poor ideas, and big ones could expose the market when founders fail to deliver what was promised, because they lack experience and have never run a business. Many ERC20 token launches in the past six months are based on bad ideas and flawed thinking where tokenomics don't work for investors. First ICOs get called out, run out of money, and many have delivered nothing to users or investors. But for the time being, ICOs will pump ETH and in 2018 we will see 5000 ICOs. Remember, Chinese investors are still out there, still buying into ICOs, and above all China is not the market, it is not Bitcoin, and the world of crypto will push on with or without them. China has and will reverse the decision, they are pumping mining pools like everyone else, Russia, America, India and the enterprise takeover continues��� China banned Bitcoin, then changed its mind. China���s rules to prevent capital flight isn���t working. China cannot pick and choose the things it likes from capitalism, it���s capitalism that is paying to build China into what it is today.	2
Raoul Pal, the CEO and founder of Real Vision, believes the price of Bitcoin (BTC) can reach $476,000 in the long term. Pal is not alone in this belief, as hedge fund managers such as Morgan Creek Digital���s Mark Yusko have also made similar predictions in the past. Currently, the price of Bitcoin hovers at around $9,700, and high-profile investors such as Max Keiser and Mark Yusko believe Bitcoin can rise to $500,000 in the long term under two simple scenarios: One requires Bitcoin to overtake the gold market, and the other stipulates that Bitcoin operates in a strong ecosystem.  Pal said: If it becomes an ecosystem, and we believe it will be and it will take the whole ecosystem with it as well, then yes, I think a $10 trillion number is easily achievable within that process. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin���s current market capitalization is $177 billion. The figure is reached by multiplying the circulating supply of 18,377,331 BTC by the market price.  The total market cap of gold is estimated to be $8 trillion, meaning Bitcoin���s market capitalization is merely 2.2% of gold. This shows that Bitcoin is still in an early phase of growth.  Bitcoin vs. traditional assets. Source: howmuch.net A growing number of investors, institutions and hedge fund managers are actively exploring alternatives to traditional assets to store wealth, and the United States Federal Reserve���s aggressive fiscal policy continues to raise concerns about the future performance of the U.S. stock market. Investors fear that over the long run, the Fed���s current policy of printing record-high amounts of cash will lead to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. As an example, earlier this week Paul Tudor Jones, one of the top hedge fund managers in the U.S. with a net worth of over $4 billion, said that he is investing at least 1% of his portfolio in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Veteran investors such as Peter Schiff frequently argue that gold is one of the best hedges against market volatility, and while this is true, there are limitations such as fungibility and the ease of transporting the asset. By nature, Bitcoin is a blockchain network that is run by node operators, miners and developers. Every transaction that is settled on the network is like a piece of data that is confirmed and verified by miners. As such, it is transparent, fast and easy to send transactions on the Bitcoin network to transfer value, whereas with gold, its physical attributes restrict transportability. In a recently published essay, Xapo CEO Wences Casares advised that medium- to large-size portfolios should have at least some exposure to Bitcoin. In the long term, Casares said that the price of Bitcoin could reach a million dollars if more than 3 billion people start to use BTC. Casares said: My preferred way of guessing how the price of Bitcoin may evolve is much more prosaic. I have noticed over time that the price of Bitcoin fluctuates around ~ $7,000 x how many people own bitcoins. So if that constant maintains and if 3 billion people ever own Bitcoin it would be worth ~ $21 trillion (~ $7,000 x 3 billion) or $1 million per Bitcoin. The predictions between $500,000 to $1 million consider a future where Bitcoin is widely acknowledged as a leading store of value alongside gold and billions of people use it on a regular basis to transfer value.	2
Cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex announced that it will block its United States-based users from trading in 32 cryptocurrencies. The exchange revealed the news in a post on its blog on June 7. Per the announcement, after June 21, U.S. traders won���t be able to access a slew of coins listed on the exchange, including QTUM and STORJ. The exchange noted that U.S. users will receive an email with explanations concerning what they are and are not allowed to do with the aforementioned assets. The options cited by the exchange include selling them for assets that will stay available to them, canceling orders and moving them off the exchange. After the change comes into effect, U.S. customers won���t be able to buy or sell the select coins, while all open orders involving said assets will be canceled. Some limited functionality concerning the assets will still be available to U.S. traders and the coins will be transitioned to the Bittrex International platform: ���U.S. Customers may withdraw or continue to hold in their Bittrex wallet affected Tokens/Coins for as long as Bittrex International supports a market in those Tokens/Coins.��� Bittrex International is Bittrex���s Europe-based affiliate, which lists certain tokens that are only available on the Bittrex International platform ��� not to U.S. users. As Cointelegraph reported in mid-March, Bittrex canceled its first Initial Exchange Offering, which it had been planning to host on Bittrex International. As reported last week, the decentralized exchange developed by top cryptocurrency exchange Binance will block website access to users based in 29 countries, including the U.S. As Cointelegraph reported this week, bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes on major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently hit a high of 263,000 BTC on May 12, a volume that has not been seen since February 4, 2018.	0
Simon Byrne has taken at-home crypto mining to a whole new level as he looks to capitalize on Ethereum���s (ETH) potential.  As first reported by Anthony Garreffa, Byrne has set up an ETH mining rig consisting of 78 GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards. Although the RTX 3080 is marketed toward high-end PC gamers, crypto miners are using these powerful specs to enhance their capabilities.  With each card using roughly 300W of power, Byrne���s setup uses 23.4KW of energy. And that doesn���t even factor in associated costs like AC. All said, his electricity bill is estimated to run up to around $2,166 per month.  The RTX 3080 launched in September at a price of $699, but supply shortages have caused the per-unit cost to swell to $1,199. At the shortage price, that���s a price tag of $93,522 for Byrne���s setup.  Still, these costs could be offset by the operation���s mining capability. One GeForce RTX 3080 graphic card has a hash rate of around 83MH/s using Ethash, which should generate roughly 0.22236870 ETH per month, according to Garreffa. All 78 cards would therefore generate 17.3 ETH per month, which is equivalent to around $12,352 at today���s prices.  Stripping away the electricity costs, that���s roughly $10,200 per month or $122,000 per year. And that���s not factoring in Ethereum���s price potential during the next bull market.  Ether���s price zipped past $700 over the weekend, the first such move since mid-2018. The return of altseason, as some have predicted, could send ETH���s price even higher over the medium term as investors cycle from Bitcoin to other large-cap cryptocurrencies.	1
Anyone who has used Ethereum in 2020 knows the frustration of paying for gas, the measure that represents a transaction���s computational weight. With gas prices sometimes rising up to 100 to 200 gwei, a unit equal to one billionth of an Ether (ETH), many users are finding themselves priced out of the action. While only a wide adoption of layer-two scaling solutions and the arrival of sharding can truly fix the situation, a few tricks can still help save some money when using the blockchain.  The easiest trick is simply avoiding making transactions during certain times of the day. New research from Flipside Crypto shows that the Ethereum blockchain shows quite specific patterns of congestion that a savvy user can exploit to pay less in gas. The analysts sampled average fees on Ethereum starting from Jan. 1, 2020. The bars represent a median where most of the data points are located, while dots represent outliers.  The chart shows that, on average, the Ethereum blockchain is busiest from 1 PM UTC to about 6 PM UTC, corresponding approximately to the early U.S. trading session between 8 AM EST and 1 PM EST. This is likely no coincidence, as during this time window both Europe and the U.S. are fully awake and at work.  By contrast, the least busy period is between 9 PM UTC and 11 PM UTC. This also makes sense ��� The U.S. workday is coming to a close, Europe is getting ready to sleep, while in Asia it is still very early in the morning. In addition to lower average values, the evening UTC period also sees fewer outliers. The information is useful to wait out periods of high activity, or to send a lower fee transaction with the confidence of knowing it will be confirmed in a few hours. The latter trick is only useful for low-priority transactions like token transfers, while it is discouraged for certain DeFi protocols.  Most notably, decentralized exchanges are usually a poor target for low-priority transactions. Slippage protection settings could mean that by the time the transaction is confirmed, the price has naturally moved from the initial point and the transaction fails ��� completely wasting precious gas. Some DeFi protocols also have internal checks to reject transactions older than a few minutes. Beyond simply waiting, some situational tricks can also help vastly decrease the cost of gas. The Chi Gas Token, for example, lowers the total gas consumed by a particular transaction. The token acts as a discount storage mechanism ��� users should mint Chi when gas is cheap and use it when fees rise. Chi can also be purchased like any other token. Depending on the user���s needs, certain solutions may help completely avoid high gas costs. Several layer-two solutions like Zk Sync, OMG���s Plasma or xDai offload transactions to another ledger, allowing virtually free token transfers after an initial setup cost. For trading, Loopring and DeversiFi offer non-custodial trading with essentially zero gas fees.  Such alternative platforms are seeing lower adoption and may not be suitable for everyone, but they are also the only realistic pathway towards reducing congestion once and for all.	1
White shoe investment bank Goldman Sachs has admitted that Bitcoin and other digital currencies could succeed as real money in developing economies. Goldman strategists wrote in a recent report: ���In recent decades the U.S. dollar has served its purpose relatively well. [But] in those countries and corners of the financial system where the traditional services of money are inadequately supplied, Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies more generally) may offer viable alternatives.��� Nonetheless, the investment bank warns against expecting 2017-level returns: ���Our working assumption is that long-run cryptocurrency returns should be equal to (or slightly below) growth in global real output���a number in the low single digits. Thus, digital currencies should be thought of as low/zero return or hedge-like assets, akin to gold or certain other metals.��� This is a remarkable change of tune from the skepticism with which big banks and ���mainstream��� investors have generally treated digital currency. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon famously called Bitcoin a fraud last year, while legendary billionaire investor Warren Buffett insists that Bitcoin isn���t money and people should stay away. Likewise, hedge fund magnate Ray Dalio dismisses Bitcoin as a bubble. Goldman Sachs holds outsized influence in the world of finance and politics. Both The Independent and Al Jazeera refer to Goldman as the bank that controls the world. The Atlantic is only slightly more subtle, referring to Goldman Sachs��� growing influence in the US government as ���The Quiet Coup.��� Likewise, the Huffington Post has written extensively about the ���revolving door��� between Goldman Sachs and the US government. The publication points out that two Goldman Sachs CEOs - Rubin and Paulson - have served as US Treasury Secretary, and former CEO Jon Corzine became a US senator. Other Goldman alums serve in various positions throughout government and finance.	2
As Bitcoin continues to grow, some altcoins are not being left behind either. Last week there was an intense competition on the Top 10 of CoinMarketCap with some casualties being posted. It was so engrossing to see some old cryptocurrencies uprooted from their longstanding positions. This registered the fact that no entity has a monopoly over a particular position. Smart Contract king, Ethereum in a very surprising circumstance lost its long-held number two spot to snowballing Bank Transfer giant Ripple. Fascinatingly, within the week it doubled its value and it was near twice the value of Ethereum. Rising almost 40 percent, its market cap was over $15 bln. It has now lost almost $2 bln and Ethereum is now closing the gap. Actually, it was the second best-performing cryptocurrency on the top 10 last week. Yet still, Ripple leads Ether with almost $2 bln in Market Cap. Some analysts in the space are strongly convinced it is likely that it will recover and take back the number two position it nearly monopolized for a couple of years. It remained to be seen since Ripple keeps making deals with banks around the world expanding its portfolios. Anyway, Ethereum with no doubt as well has become a popular smart contract platform. In a related development, on Thursday fast-growing NEM also pushed SegWit trailblazer, Litecoin to the fifth rank and became the world's fourth most valuable digital currency. This was when the Ethereum Token rose a towering 50 percent in growth rate. It became one of the notorious astonishments associated with altcoins rise since Litecoin, the silver of crypto has been performing awesomely in the market since choosing the SegWit path. Well in this space nothing is no more a bewilderment. NEM now holds more than $2 bln in Market Capitalization. Significantly New Economic Movement (NEM) was the best performing crypto in the week and continues to lead in altcoin growth in 2017. It seems to be attracting more investors to its fold. Another interesting raging battle is between the radioactivity of Ripple as a result of a misunderstanding, Stellar Lumen, and steadily declining Monero. On Thursday XLM dislodged Monero from the eighth rank but the latter fought back gallantly to take it back on Friday. Alas! This did not last long and the Microfinance Blockchain once again took over on Saturday. At the time of filing this report, the difference in Market Cap between the two was $20 mln. If Monero remains the way it is tanking, the likelihood of gaining back the position is slim. Moreover, Stellar Lumen so far has given all indications it has come to the top 10 to stay. Among the other things, last week witnessed a newcomer in the ranks of the elites when Bytecoin crashed the gates of the top 10 sending Steem stumbling down below. For four days now Bytecoin has held the tenth position firmly. It is up to them to prove to the community if they have come to stay or not. Meanwhile, Siacoin is barking fiercely to gain entrance to the top as it is now at the eleventh spot. Cointelegraph anticipates a hot week ahead.	1
UPDATE: Binance Reverses Irregular Trades, Resumes Trading Amidst Community Confusion About Hack. Users of Binance, the top cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trade volume, are reporting suspicious activity in their accounts stemming from an apparent hack on Reddit, March 7. Binance has stated that the issues stem from third-party tools and that ���there is no evidence��� of the platform itself being compromised. The only users affected are those who have issued API keys on their accounts. Reddit user shashankkgg originally posted in the Binance Exchange subreddit that all of their altcoins were sold at market rate. Another Redditor wrote ���My balance dropped by 25%, I now have VIA and 3 of my coins were sold in their entirety. I bought one of them back, only to have it sold again.��� According to their post on Reddit, Binance stated it is investigating user reports of ���issues with [users���] funds.��� While Binance is investigating the issue, they have disabled all withdrawals. Moderators of the CryptoCurrency subreddit recommend several courses of action for traders using a portfolio management tool or third-party trade bots that use Binance API keys. These include disabling those accounts on Binance or the tools themselves, disabling trade access to the API on Binance, or resetting the API key.	0
Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com predicted Bitcoin (BTC) to drop to $4,000 prior to a rebound above $10,000 by 2019 on CNBC���s Stock Draft June 22. Gordon suggested that BTC will drop below $5,000, subsequently hitting $10,000 by the end of the year, citing significant market volatility to be the main reason. When asked to explain his estimates, Gordon cited a ���beautiful uptrend,��� and called the recent correction down from $19,000 ���inconsequential��� given the gains in BTC price since 2015. The analyst said that the current high to low range is 17 percent on average, which is one of the lowest BTC has ever seen. ���There were times when it was 20, 30, 40 percent [per] week so, if I���m down 30 percent right now in Bitcoin, that���s nothing, I can make that up in two weeks,��� he continued. Gorgon argued that the cryptocurrency market is ���very technically driven,��� so reckoning on the technicals and market sentiment, it���s possible to recover certain losses in the near future. Gordon���s site, TradingAnalysis.com, provides market analysis and trading strategies. Gordon has also made predictions about other markets, including commodities like crude oil. In November 2015, when crude was trading at $41, he predicted a decline of nearly 50 percent down to $26. In February of the following year, crude was trading at $26.05. Earlier in June, stock analytics firm Trefis estimated a BTC year-end price of $12,500, which is $2,500 lower than their initial forecast. Trefis��� BTC forecast analytics is based on fundamentals of supply and demand, where demand is the number of users and the amount of transactions, and supply is the number of available BTC. Last month, Wall Street analyst Spencer Bogart said that the major cryptocurrency will trade ���at least��� above $10,000 by the year���s end. He suggested that the reality of a deeper institutionalization of the crypto space is securing the long term ���story,��� and is ���overall positive��� for Bitcoin���s future.	0
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, made a number of statements regarding the international use of digital currencies at a meeting of the Economic Club of Washington on Friday. The Secretary expressed his concern that Bitcoin wallets could potentially become the modern equivalent of the anonymous Swiss bank account. He intends to work with the G20 nations to offer US tracking abilities in order to prevent such misuse from occurring. He said: ���If you have a wallet to own Bitcoins, that company has the same obligation as a bank to know [you]. We can track those activities. The rest of the world doesn���t have that, so one of the things we will be working very closely with the G-20 is making sure that this doesn���t become the Swiss bank account.��� Mnuchin doesn���t seem to understand that not all wallets are hosted by ���companies.��� Cryptocurrency industry experts, however, aren���t so thrilled about the idea of more regulations. For example, Sergei Sevriugin, CEO and Founder of risk-sharing platform REGA, told Cointelegraph: ���I think the regulation already exists for cryptocurrency but, regulation by the community not central authorities, which is the best type of regulation that can ever exist. Centralized regulation will kill the idea of crypto currencies; and, without any control from the community, this type of regulation will lead to several problems, including corruption. We can all remember the last crisis, including the mortgage system collapse in 2008, was under full control and regulation. To put cryptocurrency under full control, the authorities must first put the Internet under control.��� Mnuchin also addressed the potential that countries may use digital currencies to skirt existing financial sanctions. He expressed a belief that there���s little risk of such activities, saying that he is ���not at all��� worried that countries such as Russia and Venezuela would be able to function in that way.	0
Bitcoin and major altcoins have recently experienced some significant volatility. While some players in the industry believe that the initial surge in price is as a result of value proposition and reasonable adoption of the entities, others have insisted that the surge is fueled by speculators who only want to recycle the capital to make a profit. The recent decline in the price of the aforementioned entities presents an opportunity for further questions about the robustness of the market value of cryptocurrencies in general. These questions arise due to the early history of Bitcoin price which saw a significant crash after previously appreciating in value.  Jason Cassidy, President of Crypto Consultant, tells Cointelegraph that this development is normal and nothing out of the ordinary. Cassidy says: ���As we witness the birth of a new financial system taking shape, it is natural to witness a certain level of speculation. Organic growth is certainly taking place and progress is being made from the top down. Government recognition and approval, continued merchant and consumer adoption along with innovative services are helping broaden the currency's appeal and utility.��� Cassidy explains that traders and speculators that have been on the market for several years are going to be focused on locking in profits after a sharp increase in price. This, he says happens each time a new growth spurt takes place. New money enters the market and as the price gets bid up, seasoned and pragmatic traders will look to take a profit. He also notes that every market has this dynamic, however with cryptocurrency markets being very much new, the volatility is greater. Over time as Bitcoin's price volatility in the market will lessen. Dana Coe of BitLox sees the network effect of Bitcoin and other crypto adoption as having a significant effect on the price fluctuations. Coe explains that given that a lot of people have at least tangentially heard of Bitcoin, very few of them have actually "gotten into" it. He also notes that since most altcoins have no actual real-world spending applications, the perceived growth within the altcoin environment appears to be a collective "bandwagon effect" rather than a reasonable investment or organic growth. According to Coe: ���Everybody is always searching for the next big thing. This builds a feedback loop driving prices and ���growth���." Coe concludes by explaining that speculation in and of itself is not a bad thing, noting that it is a free market and in all free markets there are some winners and some losers. Organic growth comes from adding more people to the user base of all coins and an exciting market is the best advertisement ever for getting people to sit up, take notice and get on board.	1
Gold bug Peter Schiff, who has often spoken out against Bitcoin, may be admitting that there���s at least some flaw in his predictions after acknowledging the coin did not ���collapse��� as gold rose to a new all-time high last month. In a Twitter exchange with Tyler Winklevoss, which began Sept. 6, Schiff traded words with the Gemini co-founder regarding Bitcoin���s rise to a yearly high of more than $12,000 on Aug. 17 and its dip under $10,000 just last week. While Winklevoss predicted the digital asset���s baseline for all future dips would be $10,000, Schiff was decidedly more bearish, stating Bitcoin (BTC) could be consolidating before a crash. ���The more the 10K support level is tested, the weaker it gets,��� said Schiff. ���Markets rarely give investors that many chances to buy the bottom.��� However, Twitter user Sharkybit wasn���t willing to let the gold bug���s word slide, posting a screenshot of Schiff���s July 5 prediction that the price of Bitcoin would drop as gold surged.  ���I was right on gold, but wrong on Bitcoin,��� said Schiff. ���The latter did manage to get through resistance and rally up to $12K, thanks in large part to a ride on gold's coattails and a massive TV advertising buy by Grayscale.���  According to Skew Analytics, the one-month correlation between gold and Bitcoin reached a record high of 68% in early August. As of this writing, the price of gold is $1,934 per ounce, having only dropped 7.1% since reaching an all-time high of $2,089 on Aug. 6.  However, Bitcoin is currently valued at $10,251, having fallen 15% since first rising above $12,000 this year on Aug 2. The correlation between the two assets has remained near 0-20% for the last two weeks, briefly dropping to 2.6% on Sept. 2. Though Bitcoin is at the moment no longer highly correlated with gold, the crypto asset may still be set to become digital gold in 2020, considering the previous price correlations and trends in the futures market. According to Skew, gold has a 27.22% year-to-date (YTD) return, while Bitcoin has racked up a 42.36% YTD yield.	1
One of the largest ETH 2.0 and Terra staking services is now looking to expand to other proof-of-stake chains, starting with upstart layer 1 Solana.  In a proposal today on Lido���s governance forums, crypto infrastructure provider Chorus One laid out a plan to build ���a liquid staking token (for now: stSOL) that will accrue staking rewards and represent staking positions with Lido validators on Solana,��� similar to Lido���s current interest-accruing stETH token.  Development funding to bring Lido���s services to an additional chain would come from the Lido Ecosystem Grants Organization, a program Lido���s governance kicked off in March. Chorus One���s requested a compensation package including 2,000,000 vested LDO tokens and a revenue-sharing model that would entitle Chorus One to 20% of the revenue from protocol fees that would go to the Lido treasury.  The milestones for Chorus One���s vesting unlocks are notably ambitious, including a 1 year cliff to ���capture 2.5% of the staked SOL supply,��� as well as 1,000,000 tokens scheduled to begin a one year vesting schedule ���when Lido for Solana manages to capture 25% of the staked SOL supply.��� The proposal notes that Chorus One is currently the largest SOL staker with $600 million in tokens.  A representative for Lido told Cointelegraph that an expansion could be a boon for the protocol���s income. ���For the Lido DAO, an expansion to liquid staking on Solana could bring with it a similar protocol fee set-up as we���re currently seeing with stETH/liquid staking on Ethereum, whereby a 10% fee on staking rewards is collected and split between node operators and the Lido DAO treasury (e.g. to grow an insurance fund),��� they said.  They also noted that the door remains open to expanding to other Proof of Stake chains. ���Lido has a very simple mission - keep Ethereum staking simple, secure and decentralised - and we will look to extend this to other networks where possible,��� they said.  Per Lido���s website, the services currently accounts for 256,964 ETH staked (worth over $700 billion) across nearly 5000 addresses earning 7.1% APY, and is the third-largest staking pool currently live per Nansen. While estimates vary, once ETH 2.0 launches, the APY rewards are expected to increase significantly.  Lido���s $LDO token has been on a tear as of late, rising 54% on a 24 hour basis to $2.9 and 216% on the week ��� a run possibly fueled by another governance proposal that would diversify a portion of the treasury to a group of notable venture capital funds, including Delphi Digital, Digital Currency Group, Three Arrows Capital, and Alameda Research.	1
Japanese e-commerce conglomerate DMM Group has launched a homegrown cryptocurrency exchange called DMM Bitcoin in a second market venture. Following the release of its mining operation in September 2017, DMM formally opened its exchange orderbook Thursday Jan. 11, offering seven cryptocurrencies and 14 trading pairs. DMM Bitcoin has a potential customer base of 27 mln existing DMM clients in addition to outside interest. Currently on offer are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, NEM, Ripple, Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash. The company���s announcement of the exchange promises promotional benefits to early sign-ups, including a 1,000 yen account credit and select fee-free operations. The project had been in the pipeline for several months and comes as Japan continues to cement its status as the world���s new regulated cryptocurrency trading hub. Commenting on the launch, English-language podcast Thinking Crypto forecast that it would be around a week until the exchange���s volume was reflected in prices. Cryptocurrency exchanges have become big business for Japan���s economy over the past six months, with the introduction of a licensing scheme that has attracted considerable interest. Pundits are also keenly aware of the benefits Bitcoin potentially holds for consumer culture. Last month, analysts from Nomura even suggested Bitcoin was adding 0.3 percent to Japan���s GDP.	2
The Venezuelan government launched the pre-sale of the world���s first national, oil-backed cryptocurrency Petro (PTR), Financial Times reports Tuesday, Feb. 20. 82.4 million Petros are already available for purchase for fiat currencies and top cryptocurrencies, although not for Venezuelan Bolivars. The government intends to attract foreign investors from countries like Poland, Denmark and Norway, as well as skirt the US and EU sanctions, according to Venezuela���s Minister of Foreign Trade and International Investment Jos�� Vielma Mora. Previously, President Nicolas Maduro had ordered the issue of 100 million Petros with the value of a single barrel of oil each. The president hopes to raise a total of just over $6 billion via the sale of PTR. To buy and trade in Petro, investors need to download a digital Petro wallet, developed by the Venezuelan government. Once acquired it will generate an address you can provide to anybody who wants to transfer PTR to you. The catastrophic drop in the value of the Bolivar made the country���s government search for alternative ways to save the economy from a meltdown. In the last 12 months, the inflation in Venezuela totaled 4,115 percent and the Bolivar lost up to 96 percent of its value, which sent the country's economy into a downward spiral. What do you think? Will Venezuela be able to outperform the entire ICO market of 2017 by securing $6 bln during the sale of Petro? #CT_questions ? Venezuela has officially launched the pre-sale of its #Petro cryptocurrency, first such issuance done by a government. The value of all tokens is equal to $6 bln, more than all 2017 #ICOs combined.   Will Venezuela manage to collect such a massive sum? Ana Heide	2
Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese multinational communications technology company, has announced that mobile phone users will be able to download Bitcoin (BTC) wallets on new Huawei devices starting Friday, Bloomberg reported May 10. Huawei is releasing BTC.com���s Bitcoin wallet in its AppGallery app store, which will be pre-installed on all new Huawei smartphones, according to Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of business operations at BTC.com. It will reportedly be the first digital currency app offered on Huawei devices. Access to apps like BTC.com���s is limited in China as the government blocks Android���s Google Play Store and some parts of Apple���s App Store. While Chinese authorities shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and banned initial coin offerings, people can still own cryptocurrencies. De la Torre told Bloomberg: ���It���s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there���s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.��� In March, it was reported that Huawei is planning to develop a smartphone that will support decentralized applications (DApp) running on blockchain technology. Last year, Huawei shipped 90.9 mln units in the Chinese market, where it enjoys a dominant market share of 20.4 percent. Huawei���s global market share was 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei���s mobile services said in a statement: ���From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.��� Last month, Huawei announced the launch of a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform focused on smart contract development, ���a high-performance, high-availability, and high-security blockchain technology platform service for enterprises and developers.��� Meanwhile, China is planning to release nationwide blockchain standards by the end of 2019. A dedicated working group has reportedly already begun work on the project.	2
Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $7,888 as participants of the SegWit2x hard fork announce they have ���suspended��� it. A circular sent to the mailing list by major proponent Mike Belshe says that it was ���clear��� the project ���had not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time.��� SegWit2x will therefore not activate Nov. 16 as planned, Belshe not naming a possible future date. The message reads: ���Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin. Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin���s growth. This was never the goal of SegWit2x.���  Bitcoin prices shot up immediately the news became public, reaching a new all-time high just under $8,000 before steeply reversing, followed by a bounceback to around $7,700. SegWit2x had received a barrage of opposition from across the Bitcoin industry, with its few supporters likewise coming under pressure to justify the hard fork. A lack of replay protection - a mechanism preventing coins being accidentally spent on both chains - was a major criticism that made even Nick Szabo come out against SegWit2x today.	1
A new wave of cryptocurrency popularity in Japan has spawned many things - the latest being a pop group known as the ���Virtual Currency Girls.��� Due to its relaxed attitude towards cryptocurrencies, Japan���s government has created a thriving atmosphere for cryptocurrencies in the country. Eastern neighbors Korea and China have enforced heavy regulations that have tried to stifle a movement that is conversely gaining massive traction in the land of the rising sun. One needs to look no further than Internet sensation Miss Bitcoin to see that the Japanese are a people that are embracing change, in the form of virtual currency. Following in her wake is a new Japanese Pop (J-Pop) group that hope to educate people about cryptocurrency. Virtual Currency Girls is comprised of eight band members known as ���Kaso Tsuka Shojo.��� Each singer takes up the identity of a number of different virtual currencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum. J-Pop has been massive since its inception in the 1990s - and it seems the music group could pioneer a new way of spreading information about cryptocurrency and the potential benefits they could have for society. According to the group���s leader, 19-year-old Rara Naruse, the pop group hopes to shed some light on the intended use of cryptocurrencies as quoted by Japan Today: ���This unit is not here to promote speculation or investment. Out of the numerous existing virtual currencies, we have carefully selected a handful of currencies that are sure to exist in the future in order to broaden the public���s understanding of them using entertainment as our medium.��� According to AFP, the group will hold its first concert on Friday, Jan. 12 in Tokyo.	2
24-hour Ethereum (ETH) trading volumes have passed Bitcoin���s according to data from CoinMarketCap on Tuesday. The period to press time at 17:00 BST showed ETH had turned $1.293 bln in volume compared to Bitcoin���s $1.271 bln.  The move, which may well be unprecedented in the history of ETH, accompanied a livelier price uptick compared to BTC, which increased just 1.65 percent since Monday versus the top altcoin���s 11.3 percent rise. ETH is now back above $200 per token since Thursday last week, when a slip became a plunge in line with Bitcoin to see it bottom out at just $120. The fortunes of the majority of top altcoins reversed over the weekend as Bitcoin���s own price improved, taking back some of the ground lost in what to investors looked like the long-awaited popping of the bubble which had accelerated through last week. Bitcoin reached almost $3,000 per coin, while ETH knocked on $300. Now, however, investors appear to be bullish once again, Bitcoin���s market dominance again in retreat below 50 percent. ���Next up is market cap then price in USD,��� former Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Bruce Fenton wrote on Twitter relaying the trading action. Fenton added he still thought Bitcoin���s Blockchain was ���superior��� to ETH. Wow! Ethereum volume just surpassed Bitcoin!  Next up is market cap then price in USD.  (I still think Bitcoin is a superior blockchain tho) pic.twitter.com/xAq2MxR31b	2
The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of Seele, a Blockchain project that bills itself as ���blockchain 4.0,��� has been compromised by scammers who stole over $1.8 mln worth of Ether. The attackers manage to dupe investors by posing as admins in the company���s Telegram channel, as reported in an article published Sunday, Feb. 4 by the Finance Magnate news site. Seele���s official ICO drop of 1 bln ERC-20-compliant SEELE tokens is supposed to take place ���soon,��� according to ICOdrops. The scammers, posing as two admins of Seele���s official Telegram channel @SeeleSupport and @nicsmith, solicited members of the Seele chat over the direct messaging feature for Ether as part of a private sale. Dr. Nick Smith is a data analyst at Seele, and the Telegram channel reported that the scammer used his name and picture on the fake admin account.  Seele���s real administrator���s responded with an official statement pinned to their Telegram channel this morning, writing that they have formed an emergency response team and added a double authentication method for administrators. The statement also posted the scammer���s wallet address, 0xB3239EF7a0fC08d56402a44A5367b8cdDaf295b8, which has a value of about $1,875,622.75 by press time.  Seele���s official statement added, ���We are deeply sorry for the scam. Although Seele has not started the presale, we will take responsibilities to minimize the loss of community members by making detailed compensation plans.��� Multiple members of the Seele Telegram channel referred to the scam as an ���inside job,��� based on the idea that only an admin can make someone else an admin. Scams in cryptocurrencies and ICOs are far from rare. On Jan. 29, Texas regulators ordered AriseBank, a self-named cryptocurrency bank, to cease and desist after their operations were revealed to be a scam. Also in January, the Bulgarian offices of the ���Ponzi-scheme��� OneCoin were raided by European Union crime fighting units, and multiple fake accounts of Charlie Lee on Twitter scammed followers under the guise of LTC giveaways. Cointelegraph has published a how-to on avoiding ICO scams when investing in crypto.	0
Dogecoin founder Billy Markus has revealed that he sold off his DOGE stash in 2015 for an amount equivalent to a used Honda Civic. Markus made the comment in an open letter to the r/dogecoin subreddit earlier this week in which he sought to introduce himself to new members of the community and outline what he believes is the ���true value��� of DOGE after the Dogecoin mania that saw it gain 900% since late January. In the post, he provided context on the history of Dogecoin, in what appears to be a love-hate relationship since the coin started as a joke back in 2013.  Markus asserted that he stood down from Dogecoin in 2015 due to online harassment from the community, and because he was uncomfortable with the direction the community was taking. During the same year, Markus said he also ran into financial concerns due to losing his job and decided to cash in his DOGE: The meteoric rise in value appears to mean little to Markus, who questions what the true value of DOGE is. Markus states that he can���t ���comprehend��� discussions of a rally to $1 as that would give an unproductive meme coin a market cap comparable to many leading U.S. companies.  Markus asserts that the true value of Dogecoin is in the community and its potential to do good. He said that if the community embodies joy, kindness, fun, empathy, creativity and absurdity, that this is the ���true value of DOGE.���  Markus��� letter follows renewed interest and speculation in DOGE, with the coin���s price increasing 50% after Elon Musk tweeted it was ���the people���s crypto��� on Feb. 4. Back in 2019 Musk was elected as the hypothetical CEO by the Dogecoin community in a Twitter poll and he has jokingly referred to himself as the ���former CEO of Dogecoin.��� On Feb .11. Musk bought DOGE for his son so that he could become a ���toddler hoddler���. Markus appears to view the interest of the world���s richest man as quite surreal.  ���I���m half detached, but it���s weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,��� said Markus. ���It���s amusing to see Elon Musk talk about it. It feels silly, but there���s this huge upwelling behind it.���	1
Taipei, Taiwan is seeking to become a smart city by utilizing the power of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), or Blockchain. The city has chosen to partner with IOTA, the inventors of the so-called Tangle technology for the Internet of Things (IoT), to provide a number of new technology features for residents. Wei-bin Lee, Commissioner of the Department of Information Technology in Taipei City Government, suggested in an official press release that the ���unique technology��� offered by IOTA will usher in a ���new era of smart cities for the citizens of Taipei���. The first project on the docket is the creation of citizen ID cards built on the Tangle technology. Called ���TangleID��� cards, the creation is designed to eliminate risks of identity theft and voter fraud, while at the same time providing a simple means for tracking health history and other data for government-related services. The company is already working on a side project for the city to create a palm-sized card with sensors that would detect light, temperature, humidity and pollution. The design is intended to give the citizens of Taipei up-to-date information about pollution levels in real time. IOTA Foundation co-founder David S��nsteb�� sees the adoption as a massive step forward, noting that ���the technology is ready for real-world use cases and is more than just a theory���.	2
The number of active Bitcoin (BTC) wallets, many of which have long been dormant, has seen an uptick that could herald some major market movements, Bloomberg reports Jan. 11. Bloomberg bases its report on data and analysis from crypto analytics startup Flipside Crypto, which sealed the backing of major crypto exchange Coinbase and veteran crypto venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) back in November. According to Flipside, as of Oct. 2018, a high number of long-inactive Bitcoin holders ��� defined as those that haven���t transferred their Bitcoin for between six and thirty months ��� have begun to transfer their coins, resulting in wallets active over the past month now holding around 60 percent of the coin���s circulating supply. Overall, the supply of active Bitcoins has reportedly surged 40 percent since summer 2018. Eric Stone, head of data science at Flipside, commented: ���It���s definitely a big shift. There���s more potential than usual for price swings.��� As Bloomberg notes, similar wallet stirrings preceded Bitcoin���s major historical price volatility in both 2015 and 2017 ��� in the latter year, the coin surged to all-time price highs of $20,000.  Flipside���s data for the number of inactive Bitcoin wallets. Source: Bloomberg.com  Flipside CEO David Balter emphasized to Bloomberg that it is long-time holders in particular, many of whom remained idle during the volatile markets of the past couple of years, who are now back on the active radar. Stone added that the trend could continue, saying: ���we have no reason to expect them to remain stagnant for another 2-plus years.��� As Bloomberg notes, tightly clustered ownership of the top cryptocurrency ��� with around 1,000 wallet address reported to own 85 percent of all Bitcoins ��� has engendered the industry moniker of Bitcoin whales, whose sizeable holdings potentially confer a consequential power to move markets. Last October ��� on the cusp of the rising trend identified by Flipside ��� blockchain research firm Chainalysis published its study into the 32 largest Bitcoin wallets. Said wallets reportedly represent 1 million BTC, worth close to $3.7 billion to press time. Their data indicated at the time that only around a third of so-called whales were active traders, and these had ���net traded against the herd, buying on price declines.��� The study thus concluded the so-called whales were not responsible for price volatility.	2
Today marks the 10th anniversary of Bitcoin's first official commercial purchase. On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz completed the first documented commercial Bitcoin purchase, paying 10,000 for two Papa John's pizzas. Valued at $41 at the time, current market pricing today gives the purchase a $92.5 million price tag. One might logically wonder what happened to the 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC) used for the purchase of two pizzas.  "Over the years the funds have moved across many addresses," Grant Blaisdell, co-founder and CMO of blockchain analytics company Coinfirm, told Cointelegraph in an email. Some BTC went to a now-defunct exchange, while some BTC remain in a highly-valued wallet.      "Some of the funds were seemingly liquidated on BTC-e," Blaisdell said. Launched in 2011, the BTC-e crypto exchange fell in 2017 when authorities apprehended exchange brass on money laundering claims. In tracing the pizza Bitcoin, Coinfirm found 5.79% of the original 10,000 BTC found its way to one of the most sizeable Bitcoin wallets currently in existence. Totalling over $5 million, about 579 of the pizza BTC still occupy the 12th largest wallet in the Bitcoin space.    Whoever owns that address also accumulated Bitcoin from elsewhere, as the wallet now totals close to $500 million in Bitcoin, Blaisdell explained. "It���s potentially someone known and active early on in the bitcoin space," he concluded, adding:  May 22, 2020 was an eventful affair as pizza day yielded a number of crypto headlines, including BitFlyer sending pizzas to folks in need, as well as Andreas Antonopoulos stirring up other early Bitcoin buying events.

Communication flow and logistics is an essential aspect of human existence which forms the backbone of the transfer of goods, services and value. As international trade and logistics continues to expand, more efficient methods are being developed to enable effective service delivery and value transfer. However, Blockchain technology is bringing another dimension to disrupt the logistics industry in areas such as transparency and efficient tracking. John Monarch, CEO at Shipchain, notes that the logistics sector employs the most people in the world. He explains that as this sector expanded over millennia, it has required innovation to scale and sustain practicality for the growing human population. This is happening again at the time of writing, with the fourth industrial revolution. Monarch tells Cointelegraph: ���Connected devices revolving around the Internet of Everything (IoE) need a higher level of security. Blockchain technology is a matchless solution in this regard because it provides the best protection through distributed ledgers, advanced encryption, smart-contracts and reduced intermediaries. As a result, this will tackle corruption, ransomware, theft, premium-fees and tracking issues.��� He concludes that once Blockchain networks begin taking their first steps on a mass-market level, they will save the international trade industry at least $50 billion per year. And upon maturity, Blockchain technology could save the logistics industry a whopping $500 billion annually. Blockchain professional Aleksandar Matanovic tells Cointelegraph that Blockchain technology will indeed work as a tool to improve processes by bringing inherent properties into the industry. Matanovic says: ���As in many other industries, I don't see Blockchain as a tool to increase efficiency, there are much more efficient systems than Blockchain-based ones. I see it as a way to make systems more transparent, more robust and less dependent on intermediaries.��� The COO of BitLand, Christopher Bates, explains that one of the main issues with chain of custody is knowing when property changes ownership or custodianship. Bates uses a car���s history as an example:   ���It is pretty important to know if a car has been in a major accident and has frame/structural damage, he says. ���If there was an immutable accessible record that kept track of the car history, there would be no way a car salesman could sell a car that had been extremely damaged.��� Bates also explains that ownership of land has many problems affecting it around the world.  One of the most consistent problems is when a parcel of land is double or triple sold, meaning a person will sell land to multiple people with only one of the sales (if any) actually being legitimate.  In some places, land titles are kept on paper or are tracked by only a single individual.  In these cases, it���s often impossible to truly know the proper chain of custody, and individuals manipulate ownership records for personal gain.   Given that shipping anything is a sequence of custody handovers, having an immutable record of chain of custody transaction makes it impossible to lose track of who is responsible for a piece of property during each handover.  Existing courier services often track packages along their route, but such methods are imperfect. Bates says: ���The issue therein is that since they are mutable, shipment records can be hidden or erased completely to the detriment of the people at large. Governments are able to hide their black budget spending by erasing shipping records or preventing records from being issued at all. On the one hand, governments will argue this is for national security, but on the other hand, the taxpayers that are sponsoring these budgets deserve transparency in spending.���   Blockchain technology combines chain of custody control with the transparency of immutable record-keeping.  This creates an ecosystem that deters malicious actors, as they will eventually become known due to system transparency.   Bates concludes by noting that anyone who claims to be in the decentralization movement should be extremely happy any time a government decides to implement Blockchain tech of any sort.  It means that government is moving towards transparency whether they know it or not.	2
Freewallet, a hosted crypto wallet service known for offering standalone storage services for cryptocurrencies has seen its marketing attempt rebuffed by Elon Musk. Responding to Freewallet���s self-promotional message, Musk retorted: Any crypto wallet that won���t give you your private keys should be avoided at all costs Hosted crypto wallet platforms like Freewallet are often targets for criticism over the storage of their user���s private keys. This policy flies in the face of the ���not your keys, not your coins��� ethos propounded by cryptocurrency purists. By storing private keys on third-party platforms, crypto owners run the risk of rogue actors gaining access to this sensitive bit of information and compromising their wallets in the process. Freewallet for its part has responded to the negative views espoused by the wallet's critics. According to the company, being a hosted wallet enables the provision of ���bank-level��� services in terms of security and customer support: Despite the clamor for utilizing self-hosted crypto storage, investors still appear to prefer trusting their coins to third-party service providers. According to a previous Cointelegraph report, 92% of institutional investors keep their cryptocurrencies on exchanges. While crypto exchange hacks are not as prevalent as they once were, some platforms do still fall victim to cybercriminals. In 2020, suspected North Korean hackers stole about $285 million from KuCoin. KuCoin did reportedly recover 84% of the stolen funds via a collaborative effort with other exchanges and law enforcement agencies. The platform also utilized its insurance fund to cover the remaining losses from the incident. Meanwhile, self-hosted wallets are becoming the subject of government attention, especially in the United States. In late 2020, the U.S. Treasury proposed Know Your Customer rules for withdrawals from exchanges to unhosted wallets.	0
2018 has been particularly cumbersome for the cryptocurrency markets, as Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren have endured a bashing. The preeminent cryptocurrency has hit a two month low sitting around $8,800 according to Coinmarketcap data at the time of writing. There are a plethora of reasons why the market has been trampled in the first month of the new year. Much of this has been due to uncertainty over regulatory moves by governments around the world, in reaction to what was a revolutionary year for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. A couple of weeks of serious uncertainty in South Korea, a tightening of the regulatory belt in massive economies like China and India, and some harsh commentary coming from financial heads and world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos have led to a sell-off in the cryptocurrency markets. The overall market capitalization has dipped to $415 bln, with Bitcoin���s market dominance sitting at around 35 percent. Its price drop has been mimicked by almost every altcoin in the top 50, all in all, summing up the current mood in the space. However, its not all doom and gloom as industry experts, those cryptocurrency gurus who���ve been around since it all started, have seized the moment to highlight vital characteristics that led to cryptocurrencies being adopted around the world. Casting aside fear, uncertainty and doubt, core members of the community believe the very qualities that underpin the revolutionary aspects of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will inevitably be their saving grace from market manipulation and governmental crackdowns. Bitcoin Foundation founder Charlie Shrem posted some insightful comments on Twitter this week, as Bitcoin continued it���s slide to recent lows. In an eight-part series of Tweets, Shrem unpacked the prevailing sentiment towards cryptocurrencies by banks and government institutions. Starting off, he said that ���Bitcoin and other privacy-focused and decentralized cryptocurrencies are the biggest innovation of my lifetime. They literally take the power and control of money out of the hands of government and into the hands of people that use it.��� He hit out at recent ICOs that have created ���a dilution of our beautiful technology��� calling ���permissioned Blockchains��� and ���digital ledger technology��� glorified ���google spreadsheets.��� He also said anything that claims to be Blockchain technology but is controlled by a single entity is not Blockchain. Following that, he explained why this ���liberating��� technology will be targeted and undermined by established institutions. ���Of course governments are going to do the same. What did you think? They would roll over while we built our alternative financial system and people started using it? Governments don't like competition.��� The World Economic Forum in Davos also provided a glimpse of the future, as more governments are likely to follow in the footsteps of Russia and Venezuela, that are issuing state-owned virtual currencies. Shrem also cautioned against this move, saying we will ���see a systemic push for regulated and controlled Blockchains by ���DLT��� companies, banking consortiums and governments. THESE ARE NOT CRYPTOCURRENCIES. Do not be fooled!��� Check out his full post: 1/ #Bitcoin and other privacy focused and decentralized crypto currencies are the biggest innovation of my lifetime. They literally take the power and control of money out of the hands of government and into the hands of people that use it.	0
Crypto exchange Bitmart lost nearly $200 million in a hot wallet compromise hosted over the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains. The $200 million Bitmart hack was first revealed by Peckshield, a blockchain security and data analytics company that initially identified a transfer of roughly $100 million over the Ethereum blockchain.  Further investigation from the team revealed a concurrent hack of $96 million over the crypto exchange���s BSC reserves: Total estimated loss: ~200M (~100M on @ethereum and ~96M on @BinanceChain ). (Previously we only counted the loss on @ethereum). And here is the list of affected assets/amounts on @BinanceChain pic.twitter.com/cXXApDFtd7 The hackers made away with a mix of over 20 tokens that includes altcoins such as Binance Coin (BNB), Safemoon, BSC-USD and BNBBPay (BPay). Sizable amounts of meme coins such as BabyDoge, Floki and Moonshot were also compromised in the hack.  According to Peckshield, the hack was a straightforward case of transfer-out, swap, and wash: Bitmart CEO Sheldon Xia later confirmed the hack over Twitter as a ���large-scale security breach��� on ETH and BSC hot wallets: 3/3 At this moment we are temporarily suspending withdrawals until further notice. We beg for your kind understanding and patience in this situation. Thank you very much. In what seems like an ongoing threat to the crypto ecosystem, cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius confirmed a loss of $50 million in the exploit of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol BadgerDAO. The first reports on BadgerDAO���s security breach surfaced on Thursday with the protocol officially announcing that it received multiple exports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds on Wednesday.  Taking preventive measures similar to Bitmart, the Badger team continued investigating the issue and paused all smart contracts on the protocol to avoid any further losses.	0
An anonymous source within Amazon has reportedly told London business newspaper City A.M. that the e-commerce giant is planning to start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments by the end of 2021, possibly setting the stage for broader mainstream acceptance of crypto transactions.  ���This isn���t just going through the motions to set up cryptocurrency payment solutions at some point in the future ��� this is a full-on, well-discussed, integral part of the future mechanism of how Amazon will work,��� the source told City A.M., according to a report published on Sunday. The source indicated that, while Bitcoin is the first step in Amazon���s crypto ambitions, executives at the company were keen to add other established cryptocurrencies in the future. The ���directive is coming from the very top,��� referring to Jeff Bezos, they said, adding:  In addition to accepting Bitcoin payments, Amazon is said to be exploring the creation of its own cryptocurrency, possibly as early as 2022, they said.  Speculation about Amazon���s entry into the cryptocurrency market has been raging for days after a new posting for ���Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead��� appeared on the company's job board last week. As per the job description, the new hire will help develop Amazon���s digital currency strategy and product roadmap. The position requires strong domain expertise in blockchain, distributed ledgers, central bank digital currencies and crypto more generally. This isn���t the first crypto-focused job posting at Amazon. As Cointelegraph reported, the e-commerce giant in February was recruiting a technical lead to help develop its new ���Digital and Emerging Payments��� platform.	1
Cryptocurrency wallet MyEtherWallet (MEW) has told Cointelegraph that rumors about it being hacked are ���FUD��� and ���a stupid lie.��� In a private message today, Jan. 9, the wallet provider categorically denied accusations circling on social media that hackers had gained access to their DNS, creating a phishing scam to gather login data. The rumors that MEW had been hacked appeared to stem from developers of altcoin Ethereum Blue (BLUE) on Twitter, who posted a string of warnings about the DNS compromise, along with advice not to use MEW. Referring to BLUE���s tweets, MEW told Cointelegraph: ���MEW is not compromised. They [BLUE] are either maliciously spreading FUD to harm others, maliciously spreading FUD to boost their own coin's price, or just so incompetent and were confused. Regardless, it's a stupid lie.��� Several of the tweets from BLUE today have already been deleted, but a screenshot of the original tweets was published in a reddit post, which has since marked the story as ���fake.��� A reddit user who allegedly works for MEW replied to the post, stating that the wallet was ���not aware of any compromises��� and reminded users that they can always access the service offline.  Official tweets from MEW several hours after the BLUE rumors had circulated did not point any fingers directly, instead opting for a more general refuting of ���FUD���: Thank you to @AnirudhaPanda @altcoinio @AppletonDave @crypto_hokie @sniko_ and everyone else who looked deeper & fought the spread of FUD. Knowing people like you are watching out for the community is why we all thrive. The light will outshine the darkness. ??? For months before today���s rumors, MEW���s site has featured a pop-up tutorial about how users can protect themselves from phishing attacks.      In December 2017, MyEtherWallet dealt with an actual scam when a fake MEW wallet app appeared in the Apple App Store. The app rose to number three in the finance app category before it was taken down.	2
South Korea is reportedly ���considering��� a ban on cryptocurrency exchange as lawmakers criticize it as ���deceptive.��� As local news outlet Hankyung reports today, the government is currently looking at changes to the law which would effectively criminalize exchanges in a method similar to China. ���We are actively considering ways to prohibit transactions on domestic exchanges by judging virtual currency trading as a deceptive means of defrauding people [...]  under the penal code," the publication quotes an official as saying. This, the official continued, requires ���serious reviewing and regulation of virtual money traders.��� The latest announcements capitalize on a slew of negative regulatory steps against Bitcoin from Korea in recent weeks. A full ban on ICOs kicked off a clampdown which will now also see Bitcoin futures outlawed, while cryptocurrency will be subject to income tax and income transfer tax in future, authorities have suggested. Previous information stated the government���s position on exchanges as requiring citizens on have only one account linked to their real identity. A sign of the confused approach taken to the booming cryptocurrency phenomenon, this week Korea���s Financial Services Commission also announced plans to lift the ICO ban.	0
One of Southeast Asia���s biggest crypto exchanges is blaming a technical glitch for the price of Bitcoin dropping down to 300,000 Philippine pesos, roughly $6,100, on Feb. 16.  An unknown number of customers of the Philippine Digital Assets Exchange, or PDAX, managed to buy thousands of Bitcoin (BTC) from the exchange at a massive discount, making them local currency billionaires on paper ��� at least for a few hours.  A number of PDAX customers withdrew their purchased Bitcoin up to the exchange���s limit on individual accounts of 1 BTC per 24 hours. PDAX is reportedly demanding these users refund BTC obtained during the crash under the threat of potential legal action.  The tech glitch led to a 36-hour closure, and several users continue to report remaining locked out of their accounts. Still unable to login for 7 days straight now. They're trying to cover up something fishy here. I also heard from many of the users that their transactions was reversed by pdax during the downtime. They're obviously lying because many still couldn't access their accounts. One user, who managed to purchase Bitcoin when it dropped to 300,000 Philippine pesos from 2.4 million Philippine pesos, took to Reddit to ask for opinions on whether or not they are legally required to return the Bitcoin, receiving an outpouring of mixed responses. ���I managed to transfer the purchased BTC to another wallet outside PDAX just before they closed the trading and eventually the website,��� the Redditor explained in a thread on r/Phinvest. On Tuesday, PDAX CEO Nichel Gaba held a press conference to further clarify what happened the week prior. He explained that the burden placed on the exchange by a flurry of unanticipated activity introduced a glitch that allowed an unfunded order to be matched with a funded order. According to Gaba, this led to a cascade effect that dropped the price of BTC below reasonable levels. Gaba stressed that of all the exchange���s customers, only ���0.2% are unable to access their accounts��� as of Tuesday. Founded in 2019, PDAX is licensed to operate as an exchange by the Philippine central bank. The exchange���s Feb. 16 closure occurred during a pivotal moment in Bitcoin���s history as its price soared above $50,000 for the first time.  PDAX is not alone in its growing challenge to meet the demand of its users, as Coinbase and Binance also suffered service outages this year.	0
Investment legend Michael Novogratz, the $3.2 bln investor and former manager of the multi-billion dollar investment firm Fortress, recently stated that the cryptocurrency market will be worth $5 trillion by 2022. Over the past two years, Novogratz has expressed his optimism towards cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that have been leading the $100 bln cryptocurrency market. Previously, Novogratz revealed that 10 percent of his net worth, at least hundreds of millions of dollars, are invested in a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Bitcoin has transformed into a global phenomenon within a period of years due to its decentralized and transparent nature that have made Bitcoin an efficient store of value, digital currency and safe haven asset for the vast majority of users, traders and investors. Other successful cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Ethereum Classic have gained interest from both individual and institutional investors with their distinctive strategies, philosophies, monetary policies and purpose. Ethereum, for instance, provides an infrastructure for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and decentralized applications (DApps), creating an intermediary-free network of applications. Ethereum Classic is more similar to Bitcoin in the sense that it has a fixed and deflationary monetary supply. Comparing the cryptocurrency market to the Nasdaq due to the variety of crypto-assets and Blockchain network, Novogratz explained that there exists no reason why the cryptocurrency market can���t be worth $5 trillion within the next five years. ���The Nasdaq got to $5.4 trillion in 1999, why couldn���t it be as big? There���s so much human capital and real money being poured into the space and we���re at the takeoff point,��� said Novogratz. During an interview with Bloomberg, Novogratz further emphasized that a rigid regulatory structure within the global cryptocurrency exchange market is absolutely necessary for the cryptocurrency market to evolve into a major financial market. Already, overseas markets including Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore and Hong Kong along with many other countries have regulated the cryptocurrency exchange market and have provided thorough, practical and efficient regulatory frameworks to attract the general public into the cryptocurrency exchange market. China, in particular, is heavily involved in its local cryptocurrency market and is actually planning to regulate smaller markets such as the initial coin offering (ICO) market that has gained increasing interest from investors since the beginning of 2017. Evidently, the cryptocurrency market and the majority of cryptocurrencies are still in the early stages of development. As Ari Paul, portfolio manager for the University of Chicago's $7.5 bln endowment, explains, most cryptocurrencies that are in existence are likely to decline in value while several major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ethereum Classic survive. ���Most cryptos, like most companies, will eventually be worth zero. This is the nature of competition. Buy and hold is a strategy, not safety,��� said Paul. More importantly, as prominent venture capitalist Naval Ravikant famously stated before: ���All Bitcoin has to do to become the premier store of value is...survive.���	2
This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. One of the most popular memes on the cryptocurrency subreddit r/bitcoin, arguably the largest concentration of Bitcoin enthusiasts on the internet, depicts a cartoon coin riding a roller coaster with its hands waving wildly in the air. On days when Bitcoin is skyrocketing in price, the meme shows the rollercoaster launching straight upward, and on days when Bitcoin is crashing, the funny facsimile is seen enduring a near-vertical drop. This dual-sided internet joke has accompanied nearly every significant movement in Bitcoin���s price in recent years and is telling in its frequency.  Bitcoin is perpetually rising and falling in relative fiat value, and even early 2018���s 70% decline isn���t surprising, nor is it the worst ever witnessed. Even amidst the most sickening of freefalls, experienced traders remain unfazed, because they���ve been there before. Holding through a correction is almost a rite of passage for cryptocurrency investors, and the group���s most experienced veterans have endured more than their fair share over the years. The early days of Bitcoin were its ���Wild West������ a time when very few exchanges made trading possible, and when only the bravest of the brave dipped their toes in. Such conditions were all but starved of liquidity, and so when the price began rising from around $0.95, the incline and the following drop were some of the steepest ever recorded.  In mid-June 2011, Bitcoin���s price reached as high as $32.00 per coin before tumbling all the way to $2.00 in November. At a 94% decline, this crash still maintains its record and holds painful memories for early investors, though those who held strong are now counting their lucky stars (and wads of bills). Looking back, this double-digit all-time high seems low, but one must remember that there was a fraction of today���s volume and interest. Bitcoin was still a largely unknown thought experiment, and no one had any indication of its future. Accordingly, $32 seemed like a good time to take profit, especially after such a spike, and other traders began to capitulate. The second significant crash happened just months after Bitcoin bottomed out at $2.00 per coin. Though the price had more than doubled from lows by the end of 2011, the market was still fearful, as it had watched the cryptocurrency fall from $32.00 only recently.  Starting the year at an optimistic $4.50, Bitcoin increased in January to over $7.00. However, dip buyers today should look to this time and take note, as it exemplifies an important fact: Bitcoin isn���t guaranteed to reach its previous all-time high before correcting once more. From around $7.40, it took a frightening 49% decline to just $3.80 in late January, shaking out some investors who had held through November���s debacle. The period between early 2012 and 2013 was uneventful. Bitcoin gained steadily and began 2013 at a price of around $13.00, reaching as high as $17.00 in 2012. Early 2013 was a bullish phase for the cryptocurrency, as it pushed past its all-time high of $32.00, reaching $49.00 before a one-day minor correction back to $33.00.  Many new exchanges and traders, in addition to expanded media coverage helped Bitcoin recover quickly, and it put on gains at a feverish pace until April, where bulls finally capitulated at a price of $260.00, breaking well into the triple digits. An outage at the then most popular exchange, Mt. Gox, was also credited as impetus for the decline. Profit-taking turned into a full-on freefall down to $40.00, for a total loss of 83%. Known as the biggest and most exemplary of Bitcoin crashes, it���s no surprise that the infamous 87% decline happened in November 2013. As the latest buildup to $20,000.00 indicated, Bitcoin bull runs tend to spin into a frenzy late in the year. As many predicted, November to January 2014 is a near mirror-image of the last four months, with a huge influx of new traders and media attention helping bitcoin reach unthinkable highs.  In late 2013, the price was nearing $1,200.00���a psychologically significant price that helped the subsequent decay last for years. With a total of 411 days in correction, helped in part by the epic implosion of Mt. Gox and erasure of almost $500 million, the post-November low was only reached in January 2015 at about $150.00. Five years on the dot after Bitcoin���s four-figure debut, the king cryptocurrency skyrocketed past the five-figure mark at $10,000.00 and pushed all the way to $20,000.00 before losing steam. The two years��� prior would prove to be some of the best opportunities to buy, and even those who purchased bitcoin at the year���s opening price of $750.00 gained significantly.  In December, a small correction down to $14,000.00 wasn���t enough to stop momentum, which quickly took it back to $17,000.00 before breaking down. Concerns about Bitcoin���s sustainability, especially with a plethora of impressive alternative solutions being released, only made the selloff more extreme. Support emerged near $5,900.00���the mid-to-late 2017 level when the cryptocurrency pricing began exhibiting a near exponential rise. A total decline of over 70% could go lower, if 2013 is anything to go by, but markets are optimistic for 2018. If anything, this long history of repeated boom and bust is an optimistic signal. Once Bitcoin entered the headlines, it never left, and it continues to snowball in popularity with retail investors and media attention the longer it stays relevant. Throughout regulatory pressures, technical difficulties, and many more corrections than the ones highlighted above, the cryptocurrency has remained at the forefront of the Blockchain revolution. Bitcoin���s fate is tied to more than its believers, however, and the multi-year struggle that occurred post-2013 demonstrates that the path back upwards isn���t always straight. With its whales creating waves whenever they like, miners searching for other ways to profit, and a new futures market, Bitcoin���s outlook remains anything but transparent.	0
Several engineers at the Russian Federal Nuclear Center have been arrested for attempting to use one of Russia���s largest supercomputers for Bitcoin (BTC) mining, Interfax reports Friday, Feb. 9. The Federal Nuclear Center employs around 20,000 people and is located in the Sarov, a secret, previously unmarked city where the first nuclear bomb was produced back in the Soviet Union. Sarov is still closed to visitors from both abroad and Russia without the proper permission, and the border is surrounded by barbed wire fences and military patrols. Tatiana Zalesskaya, the head of the press service for the research institute, told Interfax that ���as far as [she] is aware,��� a criminal case has been launched against the engineers: "There has been an unsanctioned attempt to use computer facilities for private purposes including so-called mining [...] it is a technically hopeless and criminally punishable activity" The center���s supercomputer, which has a capacity of 1 petaflop -- 1,000 trln calculations per second -- was not connected to the internet for security reasons. When the engineers tried to bring it online to utilize its power for mining, the security department was able to stop and apprehend the engineers. Legislation that is expected to legalize Bitcoin in Russia is in the works, but the specifics of how mining would be regulated, with miners perhaps needing to register with a central authority, is not yet clear. In mid-January, Cointelegraph reported that Russian businessman Aleksey Kolesnik had reportedly bought two power plants for future cryptocurrency mining operations. The engineers arrested this week were not the first to think of using former Soviet military spaces for mining. The Ice Rock Mining company has plans to set up mining operations in a former Soviet bunker located in a cave in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The company touts the naturally cold temperature of the underground bunker and its location near a hydroelectric plant as elements of an ideal cost-effective site for mining.	0
Ravi Menon, the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), expects the cryptocurrency market to recover after a prospective crash, as reported by CNBC. In an interview Monday, Jan. 15, Menon told CNBC: "I do hope when the fever has gone away, when the crash has happened, it will not undermine the much deeper, and more meaningful technology associated with digital currencies and blockchain." Menon apparently specified neither when he expects said crash to take place, nor what could potentially cause it. So far, Singapore���s central bank has taken a moderately suspicious stance towards cryptocurrencies, citing a need to ���remain alert to money laundering and other potential risks���. Still, MAS sees no need to regulate the industry as of yet. "As of now I see no basis for wanting to regulate cryptocurrencies," Menon stated in an interview with Bloomberg in October 2017. Although MAS does not have any short-term plans to regulate digital currencies, it issued a warning in December 2017 about the ���significant risks��� of dealing with crypto and advised the public to ���act with extreme caution���. Adding to his Monday statements, Menon said that he would not exclude the possibility of Singapore���s central bank issuing a cryptocurrency directly to the public, although he is not sure if it���s a ���good idea���.	2
Jack Dorsey, the CEO of both Twitter and payment service Square, has said that he sees Bitcoin (BTC) as the world���s ��� and Internet���s ��� single future currency, The Times reports today, March 21. Dorsey believes that Bitcoin���s leading emergence will take ���probably over ten years, but it could go faster���: ���The world ultimately will have a single currency, the Internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin.��� At the end of February 2018, Dorsey had previously said that Square will focus on developing more options for interacting with Bitcoin via their Cash App, calling it a ���transformation technology for our industry.��� Dorsey did note to The Times that he does not believe that at the moment BTC has the capabilities to become an effective currency, namely as a medium of exchange: ���It���s slow and it���s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable.��� Last week, Lightning Labs, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, released the first Bitcoin ready LN implementation, making free and instantaneous BTC transactions closer to reality. Dorsey had participated in their $2.5 mln seed finance round, as did Litecoin���s (LTC) creator Charlie Lee.	2
Security was never the strong suit of browser-based crypto wallets to store Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies. However, new malware makes the safety of online wallets even more complicated by directly targeting crypto wallets that work as browser extensions such as MetaMask, Binance Chain Wallet or Coinbase Wallet. Named Mars Stealer by its developers, the new malware is a powerful upgrade on the information-stealing Oski trojan of 2019, according to security researcher 3xp0rt. It targets more than 40 browser-based crypto wallets, along with popular two-factor authentication (2FA) extensions, with a grabber function that steals users��� private keys. MetaMask, Nifty Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, MEW CX, Ronin Wallet, Binance Chain Wallet and TronLink are listed as some of the targeted wallets. The security expert notes that the malware can target extensions on Chromium-based browsers except Opera. Sadly, it means some of the most common browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Brave made it to the list. Also, while they are safe from extension-specific attacks, Firefox and Opera are also vulnerable to credential-hijacking. Mars Stealer can be spread through various channels such as file-hosting websites, torrent clients and any other shady downloaders. After infecting a system, the first thing the malware does is check the device language. If it matches the language ID of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus or Russia, the software leaves the system without any malicious action. For the rest of the world, the malware targets a file that holds sensitive information such as crypto wallets��� address info and private keys. It then leaves the system by deleting any presence once the theft is complete.  Hackers are currently selling Mars Stealer for $140 on dark web forums, meaning the barrier to access the trojan is relatively low for malicious actors. Users who hold their crypto assets on browser-based wallets or use browser extensions like Authy to utilize 2FA are warned to be cautious against clicking dubious links or downloads.	0
Bitcoin Cash integration was a simple fork of the existing Bitcoin chain. Trezor promised to develop BCH integration in its wallet, only to find out that it is not so simple. The hard fork of Bitcoin to create Bitcoin Cash on Aug. 1 resulted in a difficult question for Bitcoin service providers, including wallets and exchanges - Should they support Bitcoin Cash integration? Multiple service providers decided they won't and asked users to withdraw their Bitcoins or transfer their Bitcoins to other wallets, if they wanted to get Bitcoin Cash on Aug. 1. Given that Bitcoin Cash was only a split of Bitcoin's Blockchain, and that Bitcoin Cash had replay protection in place, Trezor announced that it would support BCH integration. Users who wanted to access their Bitcoin Cash would have been able to do it through a simple interface, accessible from the Trezor wallet. Users were given a guide to claim their Bitcoin Cash from their Trezor wallets. The support for BCH was developed in a week's time and Trezor developers have admitted that it was a painful and stressful week. The development of the firmware for BCH integration, with the documented changes, went smoothly. However, the deployment of the BCH implementation of Bitcore (which is a backend for all cryptocurrencies supported by the Trezor wallet) caused several problems. Bitcoin ABC, which is a full node implementation of the BCH standard, had made several changes to the code, including style changes. That made comparing code and implementing Trezor support a time-consuming task. A particular bug caused transactions to disappear and negative balances in wallet addresses, necessitating code rewriting and taking the backend offline. The increasing number of cryptocurrencies has resulted in the need for multiple wallets to be installed on people's computers. Often, there is fear of malware masquerading as a wallet being installed on a computer. People avoid this by storing their minor cryptocurrencies on exchanges or online wallet providers. However, this strategy exposes users to the risk of the exchange being hacked and the cryptocurrencies being stolen. As the difficulties in Bitcoin Cash integration have shown, a universal wallet (hardware or software) capable of storing all cryptocurrencies remains a utopian dream.	1
As non-profit cryptocurrency research institution CoinCenter���s Neeraj K. Agrawal wrote, 2017 was the year in which Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies went mainstream. Numerous major financial institutions have integrated support for Bitcoin, with elite investment banks like Goldman Sachs contemplating the creation of Bitcoin trading desks in 2018. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and CME Group, the two largest futures exchanges in the world, successfully launched Bitcoin futures trading last month. Things to look out for in 2018 in #Bitcoin:   1. Nasdaq Bitcoin Futures  2. NYSE Bitcoin ETFs  3. Cboe Bitcoin ETFs  4. Scaling / Lower Fees  5. More Adoption Due to ���  6. Many Billion of Institutional Money Coming to Bitcoin / Crypto   No wonder analysts are so optimistic! The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the biggest stock market in the world in terms of daily trading volume, has applied two launch two Bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Cboe has applied to launch six such ETFs themselves. Bitcoin futures are strictly regulated investment vehicles that can provide institutional investors and high profile individual investors immediate access to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, will provide easy access to Bitcoin for retail investors and some classes of institutions that do not trade on the futures market. In March 2017, as Cointelegraph reported, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected a Bitcoin ETF filing submitted by the Winklevoss twins, the first confirmed billionaire Bitcoin investors, because of the Bitcoin market���s lack of regulation. However, the global Bitcoin market and its regulatory landscape have drastically changed since then. The Japanese government recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate currency while other large markets like South Korea have introduced practical regulations for local cryptocurrency businesses and investors. Most importantly, the SEC left the door open for approval of a future Bitcoin ETF in the event that regulated Bitcoin futures markets should be developed. As such, it is highly likely that Bitcoin ETFs will be approved in 2018, given that Cboe and CME have proven that Bitcoin can be traded on strictly regulated platforms with proper investment protection. Mainstream news publications around the world have drastically increased their coverage of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies in the last year. Several news publications, including CNBC and Forbes, have created cryptocurrency-specific media channels to address the rapidly growing demand for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. In some countries, cryptocurrency mania has formed, as investors of all ages have begun to engage in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading. In South Korea, speculation around the cryptocurrency market has reached a point in which the South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon released a public statement addressing the sudden increase in demand for digital currencies. Several months ago, the South Korean government formed a task force to draft regulations to cover the digital currency market. South Korean govt's #Bitcoin regulations from this week:   1. Gov't will impose regulations based on global trend.  2. Special cryptocurrency law drafted, *exchanges not compliant with policies* cannot operate.  3. Open towards Bitcoin / blockchain tech development.   Optimistic. Over the past few months, the entire cryptocurrency market has experienced a drastic trend-shift as altcoins have surged in value. The ���Bitcoin Dominance��� metric has reached an all time low of 37.3%, indicating that the number one cryptocurrency now accounts for just over one third of the market cap of the entire digital currency sector. While there is some controversy over the use of market cap numbers to estimate the size of the market, it is clear that Bitcoin is no longer the only major player. Alternate digital currencies like Ethereum and Dash have increased in value over 100x in the past year. Ripple in particular had an spectacular rally throughout 2017, as its value skyrocketed from $0.006 to $2.38, a 360-fold increase. While its current $88 billion market valuation is being questioned by analysts like Ryan Selkis from ConsenSys, it still remains as the second largest digital currency by market cap.	1
As the headlines pile up about Bitcoin���s calamitous environmental impact, one group of investors and supporters have stepped up to the plate to defend the world���s largest digital asset with the help of a crowdfunded, FUD-fighting documentary film.  First announced by investor, podcast host, and Bitcoin fanatic Brad Mills on Twitter, the goal of the film is to act as a ���definitive��� argument for ���why Bitcoin will transition the world to renewable energy faster than governments.��� I found the filmmaker (@jamie_jk) to make the definitive short film on why Bitcoin will transition the world to renewable energy faster than governments.It will only cost $20-30k for a professional mini-doc on BTC energy FUD.I will put up $5k in, who���s with us?#GreenBitcoin https://t.co/7MSPTUlArP Mills��� choice of director is Jamie King, best known for STEAL THIS FILM ��� a documentary series about BitTorrent and one of the earliest examples of a crowdfunded, free-to-share effort. In an interview with Cointelegraph, King said that the narrative about Bitcoin���s energy consumption pushed him into action.  ���The idea for this new project, which we're raising funds for right now, came about as a result of the increasing amount of attention being paid to Bitcoin's energy usage,��� King said. ���Obviously this came to a head with Elon's announcement about not accepting BTC for his cars for the time being -- but it's also a piece of 'FUD' we're seeing repeated with greater and greater intensity.��� Earlier in the week, billionaire Elon Musk Tweeted that his company Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin for payments ��� a comment that set off accusations of hypocrisy, but whose contents were echoed loudly in the mainstream media. Despite Elon���s gripes, specifics about how much ���dirty��� energy Bitcoin consumes is difficult to calculate, however, and even estimates based off of Chinese consumption may only paint a rough picture.  Regardless, King and crew aren���t trying to argue that Bitcoin is clean, green tech.  ���I think it's important to acknowledge Bitcoin uses energy. A lot of it. That's part of its design,��� says King. ���The question we need to ask is: is it worth it.��� To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can���t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal King said that those who instinctively answer ���no��� to that question likely haven���t done their research, and that ���in a broader social, political and economic context��� the case for Bitcoin���s energy consumption is self-evident.  So far the community has responded warmly, raising .5 BTC in just 48 hours. King also notes that while Bitcoin���s Lightning Network hasn���t seen the adoption some hoped for, after the project opened up to Lightning donations small backers began pouring in.  ���I guess what we can see is that Lightning is very real for small Bitcoin donations, I���m glad to say,��� he joked.  In the end, King���s goal isn���t to fling mud back at the FUD-sters, but instead to educate and elevate.	1
The Golden City is losing its shine as one of the largest United States-based cryptocurrency exchanges closes its San Francisco-based headquarters.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell retweeted an announcement stating that the exchange will close its global headquarters at 548 Market Street, in the center of San Francisco. In the statement, a copy of which was initially tweeted by San Francisco-based political commentator Richie Greenberg, Powell states:  A spokesperson from Kraken told Cointelegraph that their "responsibility has been, and always will be, to ensure the safety and security of our team members," adding that Kraken has "no plans to establish a new, formal global HQ" following the San Francisco closure. A poor advertisement for living in California���s financial center, the statement also alleges that ���San Francisco is not safe��� and crime is ���dramatically underreported.���  BREAKING: KRAKEN CEO Jesse Powell @jespow today issued a statement regarding rampant crime in San Francisco and the failures of DA @chesaboudin . pic.twitter.com/7gx7PldQM0 Coinbase, another U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, will also close its San Francisco headquarters in 2022; however, no mention of crime or homelessness was cited regarding the decision. Instead, Coinbase is following the lead of its competitor Binance to become a fully remote, global company.  The Kraken spokesperson explained to Cointelegraph that Kraken was "one of the first companies in the world to pioneer the remote-first model." The focus on "round-the-clock crypto services," especially relevant given that crypto markets are 24/7 is key. Kraken continued: The Twitter community was quick to respond to the Kraken news, sharing dark anecdotes of working in San Francisco.  I worked at Market St for few months, it is crazy, it turns into skid row after 6pm. I'm from Europe and never seen anything like it. Still have flashbacks of the things I witnessed. Just tried to look away and not get stabbed. Remember walking in the smell of skunk and pee. The living situation has allegedly become so dire that there are applications that track human waste around San Francisco, with ���Snap Crap��� among the most popular. The apps help San Franciscans navigate the city without putting their foot in it.  Comments from the Twitter and Reddit community shed light on how soaring rental prices have made homelessness more common, while crime is ���rampant.��� The average rent is now roughly $3,000 per month, and the San Francisco Chronicle has estimated that there are more than 18,000 people experiencing homelessness in the city.  A report in 2020 revealed that San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area boasted the highest concentrations of crypto investments. In light of Kraken���s decision and the social crises in San Francisco, the region���s hold on crypto and the future of finance may falter.  Other U.S. cities and states have made clear their intentions to attract crypto capital. Texas, for example, hosts pro-Bitcoin (BTC) Senator Ted Cruz, while Web3 and crypto payments have been lauded by the mayor of Austin.	0
Calls for cryptocurrency regulation were a resounding theme at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.The world���s most prominent financial institutions remain wary of going all in on cryptocurrencies, amid fears of future regulation leading the market to tank. Governments around the world have signaled their ongoing or imminent intent to legislate and regulate cryptocurrencies around the world, and it seems the largest banking and financial firms are waiting for more clarity before they forge ahead with plans to enter the market. Countries like Russia are forging ahead with the creation of their own, government-issued cryptocurrency, which they can fully control. Others, like Venezuela, have been forced to do so to battle out-of-control inflation that has crippled its economy. Opposed to a decentralized and anonymous system, the creation of a cryptocurrency that governments can control is their only option to wrestle back some semblance of ���control��� that has been handed to the everyday man using cryptocurrencies. Speaking to RT at the WEF in Davos, Universa CEO Alexander Borodich said governments are keen to issue their own virtual currencies that would be backed by commodities like oil. ���From my perspective, they will offer state country-wide cryptocurrencies like Cryptorruble or crypto-barrel if they like to��� back the oil they have or other natural resources.��� He added that 2018 would see the emergence of these state-issued cryptocurrencies to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and other popular virtual currencies. Despite the best intentions of honest developers, exchanges and Blockchain engineers, there is a prevailing sentiment that the underworld still uses cryptocurrencies. It���s been a number of years since the closure of Silk Road and subsequent black markets, but heads of states are still citing concerns over the nefarious uses of virtual currencies. As quoted by the Independent, US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said there is a concerted effort being made to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for illicit trade. "My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or Bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities.��� A major concern is also the well-being of financial markets and systems that have been shaken up by the massive adoption of Bitcoin and altcoins in the past 12 months. In the words of Mnuchin: "We encourage fintech and we encourage innovation, but we want to make sure all of our financial markets are safe. We want to make sure that the rest of the world -- and many of the (Group of) 20 countries are already starting on this -- have the same regulations.��� IMF head Christine Lagarde also painted a harsh perception of cryptocurrencies. "The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements.��� Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency community has been bullish on social media, slamming the apathy swirling around at Davos this week.	1
One reason used by Bitcoin opponents, including Jamie Dimon, to attack it is its high volatility. Is high volatility such a bad thing for Bitcoin after all? One reason why traditional investors have shunned Bitcoin is that its price has swung from one extreme to another. Its price increased from around $1,000 at the beginning of the year to a peak of over $5,000 in September 2017 (gain of +400 percent), before crashing to a low of $3,000 (-40 percent from its peak). Even this represents an improvement from the initial days when Bitcoin price crashed from $32 to $2 in 2011 (a drop of 94 percent). There have been periods of low volatility, but these have been few and far between. Bitcoin may be called digital gold, but in terms of volatility, it looks more like stock markets on steroids. For day traders and short-term investors, volatility presents an opportunity for making profits. By correctly predicting the short-term trends in Bitcoin, traders can make substantial profits; much more than investors who have a buy-and-hold strategy. Highly volatile markets also create demand for secondary derivative products like options. As the cryptocurrency market develops, we could see increased trading of derivative products rather than actual trading of Bitcoin. As per the London Bullion Markets Association, it is estimated that 95 percent of gold trading in London is in unallocated metal (which is not settled). Bitcoin is still in its infancy, but as the market develops we could see the same trading characteristics in Bitcoin as well. Merchants, no matter how tech-savvy they are, hesitate to accept Bitcoins for their goods and services. Their core competence lies in providing goods and services, not in managing Bitcoin's volatility. They work on thin margins and hate even the one to two percent transaction fees imposed by credit card companies. The Bitcoin price can move substantially between the time they accept Bitcoins from customers, and they sell these Bitcoins in exchange for their local currency. This price movement can wipe out their entire profitability. This is the reason why most merchants accept Bitcoin only through payment processors like Coinbase, which removes the risk associated with holding Bitcoins. In the end, merchants have to pay their bills using fiat currencies, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class. Although the level of awareness about Bitcoin among the general population has increased, only a small proportion of them hold significant amount of Bitcoins. Moreover, institutional investors have largely avoided Bitcoin, given its unregulated nature and the risks associated with it. As Bitcoin adoption increases and demand increases, its price can move up rapidly. Similarly, when there is negative news about Bitcoin, like the Chinese shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges, some of the holders of Bitcoin will sell and its price can crash rapidly. Until the holding of Bitcoin becomes widely distributed and its liquidity improves substantially, we will see substantial volatility in Bitcoin price.	1
Devices found at Telecom Egypt demarcation points have been found to be surreptitiously redirecting Egyptian Internet users to advertisements and cryptocurrency mining sites, according to a report published by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Friday, March 9. The technology research lab���s report explains that the scheme, referred to as Adhose, operates via middleboxes, computer networking devices for manipulating internet traffic. The report identifies two modes of redirection used on Egyptian citizens: ���spray mode��� and ���trickle mode.��� ���Spray mode��� means that a middlebox ���redirects Egyptian Internet users en masse to ads or cryptocurrency mining scripts whenever they make a request to any website,��� and is seemingly used ���sparingly.��� ���Trickle mode��� means that only attempts to open certain URLs redirects users to these ads or mining scripts, specifically CopticPope.org (which was formerly the website of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria) and Babylon-X.com (formely a porn site). Coinhive, a Monero mining platform that positions itself to sites as an online advertising alternative, was also listed in the table of links for AdHose middleboxes to redirect Egyptian users. Coinhive has previously been linked to a large case of cryptojacking at the end of January 2018, when hackers ran YouTube ads with a Coinhive script that secretly used up the users��� CPU power for mining. American cable network Showtime was also found to be using Coinhive on two of their websites as an alternative for advertisements back in September of last year, albeit without informing their customers. After Showtime���s surreptitious use of the mining script was exposed, Coinhive announced that in future it would seek permission from users before using their computers to mine Monero. Citizen Lab���s report showed that the same middlebox that runs AdHose was also responsible for Internet censorship in Egypt, blocking websites for Human Rights Watch and the news outlet Al Jazeera. The report noted as well that middleboxes in Turkey and Syria were redirecting users attempting to download software to different versions of the same software with spyware attached. A fingerprint of a network injection of the middleboxes, deep packet inspection (DPI) devices, was patched with a second-hand PacketLogic device made by Canadian network equipment company Sandvine. In the report, Sandvine denied that their products could be used in such a manner, and highlighted to Citizen Lab their human rights protection standards that prompt a review of a sale when the customer is part of a country ranked low on the Worldwide Governance Indicators. Citizen Lab writes in their report that Sandvine���s safeguards have ���come up short,��� and recommends that the company begin engaging in ���regular consultation with civil society regarding its human rights due diligence and business ethics program.��� While Egypt���s first Bitcoin exchange was reported to be opening in August 2017, the Egyptian government has taken a hard line against cryptocurrencies in the country. Egypt���s top cleric called Bitcoin (BTC) ���unlawful��� under Sharia law in January of this year. A year earlier in February 2017, a Sharia law expert had told Cointelegraph that since Islam has historically only recognized ���commodities of intrinsic value��� as money, ���Bitcoin probably misses the mark.��� It is unclear how Monero or Coinhive���s mining script would thus fall under Sharia law.	0
Bank of England governor and head of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Mark Carney told G20 members that cryptoassets ���do not pose risks��� to the world���s economy in a letter dated March 13, Reuters reported Sunday, March 18. The letter was addressed to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, who will gather for the summit in Argentina starting Tuesday March 20. In it Carney dispels the idea that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are having an adverse effect on financial security. ���Responding to the concerns of members, the FSB has undertaken a review of the financial stability risks posed by the rapid growth of crypto-assets,��� the letter reads. ���The FSB���s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time. This is in part because they are small relative to the financial system.��� This week���s G20 summit has been a red letter day in the cryptocurrency industry for several months. As early as December 2017, international regulators and politicians signalled they would use the event to bring the topic of crypto regulation to the international stage, pushing for a coordinated future roadmap. Carney has already appeared to move markets, with BTC/USD jumping by around $1,000 as the letter circulated Monday, March 19. Bitcoin is currently trading at an average of $8,300, up 7.25 percent in the 24 hours to press time. Carney himself had also previously voiced the need for regulating rather than banning cryptocurrencies, despite claiming in February that Bitcoin had ���failed��� as a currency. Compared to legacy debt, however, such new assets are no cause for concern, he now writes: ���Even at their recent peak, [cryptoassets���] combined global market value was less than 1% of global GDP. In comparison, just prior to the global financial crisis, the notional value of credit default swaps was 100% of global GDP.��� Going forward, he adds, the FSB ���will identify metrics for enhanced monitoring of the financial stability risks��� should usage of those assets continue to grow, ���updating the G20 as appropriate.���	2
PlanB, the well-known creator of the contested stock-to-flow (S2F) model, believes Bitcoin (BTC) is now well on track to reach $100,000 as the price has risen to yearly highs. The optimistic sentiment coincides with the shift in momentum from alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, to BTC. He said: ���I can't make a chart for you now (at sea), but S2F model perfectly on track.��� At the same time, the price of Bitcoin has increased by 17% this week, as it broke through a major three-year trendline. As Cointelegraph reported, traders seemingly expect BTC to test higher resistance levels in the near term.  The price of Bitcoin surpasses $11,700 in a swift intraday rally. Source: TradingView.com Altcoin declined particularly in the past 72 hours when the price of Bitcoin started to rally. Ethereum���s Ether (ETH) moved in tandem with BTC throughout the rally, but it slumped against BTC in the past two days. In the short term, as Bitcoin sees a profit-taking rally from altcoins, some investors expect BTC to outperform altcoins. Kelvin Koh, the co-founder of Asia-based venture capital firm Spartan Group, said: ���If BTC breaks the resistance at $11.4K, we are going above $12K in no time. Will take the wind out of alts again short term.��� The pattern of a Bitcoin rally following a strong altcoin season is not new. In previous cycles, the top cryptocurrency typically saw a sharp uptrend after altcoins initially gained against BTC. Such a trend materializes because investors seek safer options, like BTC, when the altcoin market gets overheated. Most recently, the fear of missing out, or FOMO, of retail investors around DeFi led small market cap tokens to surge substantially. In the early days of the DeFi market craze, for example, Compound (COMP) saw a major rally. Then, smaller tokens, including Yearn Finance (YFI), Synthetix Network (SNX), and Aave (LEND), followed. Eventually, as small tokens saw five to ten-fold spikes in price, investors started to take profit. The abrupt pullback of DeFi tokens coincided with a BTC rally as momentum shifted back to Bitcoin. Data from Skew shows that tens of millions of dollars worth of short contracts are still getting liquidated. It indicates that a relatively large number of investors are betting against BTC in the near term.  Bitcoin liquidations on BitMEX. Source: Skew Cryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark said that while he understands why shorts are compelling, the upward trend is too strong. He said: ���Looking at trades from the standpoint of R:R is good, but understanding context is superior. After a major contextual change like this, you can assume that your shorts have a lower probability of resolving successfully. Bets should be on strength always showing up.��� For some traders, a short against Bitcoin could be attractive because BTC has increased steeply in the past week and is testing major resistance levels.  A 17% rally in six days ��� even during a bull market ��� is substantial, even for Bitcoin. But when the trend of BTC is overwhelmingly bullish, a short squeeze could only add more rocket fuel. In the last 12 hours, more than $23 million worth of shorts were liquidated, for example, as the price hit as high as $11,750. Thus, during a strong upward price trend, shorts could indirectly catalyze a larger rally.	2
The ���Buffett Indicator��� is hinting that the United States��� stock market is currently at dot-com bubble levels, Yahoo Finance reported on Aug. 20. The indicator divides the Wilshire 5000 Index by the GDP of the U.S. Meanwhile, on Aug. 14, Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway invested in Barrick Gold, the second-biggest precious metal miner in the world. Some analysts said it could benefit Bitcoin (BTC) in the long term as it coincides with this stock market bubble alarm. The historical average of the indicator is 1, and before the dot-com bubble, it hovered at 1.71. Currently, the Buffett Indicator is reportedly at 1.7, signaling that the stock market is highly overvalued. If the U.S. stock market slumps as investors fear the overvaluation of equities, Bitcoin could see a major reaction. According to Tom Essaye, the founder of Sevens Report Research, stocks are considered as ���fundamentally overvalued��� when the Buffett Indicator hits 1.3.  The current level of 1.7 indicates that there is a potential for a steep downtrend in the stock market if the trend reverses. He explained: ���What does that mean for us? It means stay long stocks in longer-dated accounts, and make sure you own assets (such as a house, etc.). But it also means this asset inflation cycle better not stop, because as the 1.7 times total market cap to GDP ratio tells us if asset inflation stops, it���s a long, long way down to fundamental support.��� Throughout the past four months, Bitcoin has shown some correlation with the S&P 500 and gold. Since late July, due to the decline in the U.S. dollar, BTC has more closely followed the price of the precious metal. An argument could be made that a potential pullback in the U.S. stock market could strengthen Bitcoin���s momentum. Some institutions have started to consider Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value, causing institutional inflows into BTC to spike.  The correlation between Bitcoin and gold. Source: Skew.com The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 broke slightly in the past week, as stocks continued to surge. The price of BTC rejected at $12,400, recording an 8.6% drop to as low as $11,370.  The deteriorating correlation between Bitcoin and the U.S. stock market, and the simultaneous slump of BTC and gold, buoy the bull case for BTC when stocks decline. In the short term, technical analysts are cautiously anticipating a consolidation phase for Bitcoin.   A potential short-term scenario for Bitcoin. Source: Michael van de Poppe Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said dropping below $11,500 again could lead to a bearish divergence. He said: ���Well, on the daily timeframe we've arrived at the crucial level to hold for further upwards momentum. White small square Bearish divergence only gets confirmed if we lose this $11,500 zone. White small square Holding here = bounces on altcoins. White small square In general still altseason and alts continue.��� Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of ���Rich Dad Poor Dad,��� also said that a banking crisis is coming. Emphasizing that Buffett has trimmed his positions in major U.S. banks, he hinted gold, silver, and Bitcoin could see significant gains as safe-haven assets. The confluence of a tightening correlation between Bitcoin and gold and the rally of the stock market could raise the likelihood of a BTC uptrend when stocks begin to fade.	0
The Square Cash App, an app for sending and receiving fiat currency from the mobile payments company Square, has now made Bitcoin (BTC) trading available for almost all of its users, excluding those in New York, Georgia, Hawaii, and Wyoming. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and Twitter, announced the news in a tweet Jan. 31, which also included a short cartoon entitled ���My First Bitcoin���, explaining Bitcoin to industry newcomers. Instant buying (and selling, if you don���t want to hodl) of Bitcoin is now available to most Cash App customers. We support Bitcoin because we see it as a long-term path towards greater financial access for all. This is a small step.   We also made this! https://t.co/z3u0liDNk4 Since Square operates on a Point of Sale (PoS) network, the addition of BTC to its mobile services means that in the future any merchant that uses Square���s payment system will potentially be able to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. While the company says they will not add additional transaction fees for buying and selling BTC on the Cash App, the app calculates the price at which you can buy and sell from the quoted mid-market price, an average across major exchanges. According to Square���s site, users will be allowed to buy up to $10,000 in BTC a week, while there is no limit for selling. Square had previously announced in November 2017 that they would release a BTC trading option to a select 3 million customers, causing their stock to jump $1 billion in five days. Since the announcement Square���s stock had increased by more than 3 percent when it closed Wednesday, Jan. 31.  Square���s announcement comes shortly after Robinhood, another trading app, announced that it would begin allowing users to trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum without fees starting in February. Coinbase, which charges transaction fees but has more users than brokerage firm Charles Schwab, has long been considered the most reliable exchange for crypto trading. With the addition of Robinhood and Square to the crypto trading sphere, with already more than 1 mln users on the waitlist for Robinhood���s crypto trading platform, it���s clear that the market for crypto trading applications is heading in a less centralized direction.	2
More than a thousand of crypto projects are ���already dead��� as of June 30, 2018, according to a recent TechCrunch report. The news outlet has based its claim on data from two websites: Coinopsy and DeadCoins. Coinopsy provides daily reviews of various cryptocurrencies, including ones that are already ���dead.��� It defines a ���dead��� token as exhibiting at least one of the following: ���abandoned, scammed, website dead, no nodes, wallet issues, no social updates, low volume or developers have walked away from the project.��� According to Coinopsy���s list, there are 247 ���dead��� coins as of press time. These include the notorious Bitconnect that was shut down in January 2018 and is described by the website as ���the most successful ponzi-scheme in crypto so far.��� DeadCoins similarly has a 830-item long list of ���dead��� cryptocurrencies. Among them is the recent Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services initial coin offering (ICO) that was shut down by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for fraudulent practices. According to the SEC���s press release, Titanium has raised $21 million from investors from the U.S. and other countries. In its statement, the SEC warned investors about ICOs as an extremely risky type of investment: ���Having filed multiple cases involving allegedly fraudulent ICOs, we again encourage investors to be especially cautious when considering these as investments.��� As Cointelegraph reported Friday, the volume of ICOs has reached $13.7 billion in 2018 so far, which is already twice as much as the market amounted to in the entire 2017. According to TechCrunch, scam and dead ICOs raised $1 billion in 2017. On June 21, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman warned that ICOs pose ���serious risks��� for retail investors, claiming that projects that raise money this way have ���almost no oversight.��� Earlier in June, crypto evangelist John McAfee said that he will stop promoting ICOs due to alleged threats from the SEC.	0
Cryptocurrency bull and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors Thomas Lee said that the ���fair value of Bitcoin (BTC) is significantly higher than the current price,��� Bloomberg reported on Dec. 13. In a note delivered on Thursday, the veteran market analyst reportedly said that Bitcoin���s fair value is between $13,800 and $14,800, considering the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply. Lee attributed the divergence to last year���s meteoric rise, a macroeconomic ���meltdown��� and treasury sales during initial coin offerings (ICOs). Lee stated: ���In fact, working backwards, to solve for the current price of Bitcoin, this implies crypto wallets should fall to 17 million from 50 million currently.��� Among key drivers that would drive the value of BTC upward, Lee named mass adoption of Bitcoin and its acceptance as an asset class. He also noted that the fair value of the leading cryptocurrency would reach $150,000 per coin, once BTC wallets account for 7 percent of Visa���s 4.5 billion account holders. Lee has repeatedly expressed his optimistic stance towards Bitcoin���s recovery. Speaking at BlockShow Asia 2018, he noted that crypto has only 50 million active wallets so far against the 254 million PayPal accounts in Q3 2018 and 4.6 billion Visa and MasterCard accounts. Comparing Bitcoin to other payment systems in terms of social network value, Lee supposed that in ten years it could be worth $10 million per coin. Despite the recent market crash, Lee reiterated his year-end price prediction for BTC at $15,000 in late November. The analyst pointed out two major types of crypto players, those who are ���using it and have wallets in crypto,��� and those who belong to a speculative side of the market. Today Cointelegraph reported that cryptocurrency gained 17 million ���verified users��� this year, according to a study published by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. In the first three quarters of 2018 the number of ID-verified cryptocurrency users reportedly nearly doubled, climbing from 18 million to 35 million.	0
Bitcoin is now the sixth most circulated currency in the world, behind five super powers, and outranking the Pound, the Ruble, and the Won, according to the Bank for International Settlements. The figure is based on a value of Bitcoin at $10,765 each, meaning that the total value of all Bitcoins in circulation is $180 bln. While the number is substantial, should Bitcoin rise to $15,000, it will overtake the next highest circulating currency, the Rupee. The other four currencies outranking Bitcoin are the Yen, Yuan, Euro, and Dollar, all of which have dramatically greater levels of currency in circulation (the Dollar, for example, stands at $1.4 tln). Other cryptocurrencies are also following suit, with Ethereum ranked at #17, and Bitcoin Cash at #20. Ripple falls just outside the top 20. However, both BCH and XRP are still above both the Krona and Rand for total circulation. These numbers are, of course, somewhat skewed, because the value of notes in circulation is not reflective of the total value of a currency. Nevertheless, the numbers reveal the substantial power of Bitcoin in terms of currency interactions.	2
Amid a weekend pump carrying multiple cryptocurrencies higher, Ripple���s XRP looks to be leading the way with a push as high as 30% on the daily ��� carried on the back of a string of legal victories and rumors of relisting at some exchanges.  Where Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are up merely 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively, on the day, XRP climbed to $1.36 before retreating to $1.32, where it sits at the time of publication. The digital currency is now up 111% on a seven-day basis and a staggering 544% on the year. The recent push has also buoyed XRP back into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap behind only BTC, ETH and Binance Coin (BNB) at No. 4.  :) pic.twitter.com/qYIf6RPOoY The rally flies in the face of a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which charges that XRP���s $1.3-billion ICO was an ���unregistered securities offering.��� The news led multiple exchanges to delist the currency, and XRP lost its place as the third-largest currency by market cap, at time looking as if it would even fall out of the top 10.  The bad news for XRP didn���t stop with the SEC, either. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company would be ���winding down��� its relationship with MoneyGram ��� a once-highly-touted partnership that investors often pointed to as proof of the digital currency being on a path toward becoming ���the standard��� for payments and settlement.  Despite the deluge of negative headlines, it appears all buyers needed was a small ray of hope to jump back in ��� and they���ve gotten exactly that. Ripple lawyers have notched two victories in their legal battle against the SEC, including winning access to internal SEC discussion history regarding cryptocurrencies, and a court denied the SEC the ability to disclose the financial records of two Ripple execs, including Garlinghouse.  Ripple executives seem heartened by the news, with chief technology officer David Schwartz saying the U.S. isn���t ���prepared��� to regulate cryptocurrencies (a possible dig at the ongoing legal proceedings).  All in all, it���s just another week for one of the most controversial cryptocurrencies in the space.	2
In a sign of growing mainstream acceptance, digital currency exchange Coinbase now boasts more accounts than brokerage firm Charles Schwab. According to its website, Coinbase has 13 mln users while the number of Schwab brokerage accounts stood at 10.6 mln as of the end of 2016. These numbers don���t paint a complete picture, since the amount of assets controlled by Schwab certainly vastly exceeds those of Coinbase users. Nevertheless, the actual number of users indicates a massive volume of adoption, as the public begins to dabble in cryptocurrencies. Coinbase user numbers have grown by 167% this year. Coinbase openly publishes the number of active accounts on their site, and traders have been keeping a close eye on those numbers throughout the digital currency boom this year. Such large numbers of individuals creating accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges should put an end to the thought that Bitcoin is just a fringe economic event. Regardless of bullish or bearish expectations, the reality is that Bitcoin is gaining traction amongst members of the general public. This is further demonstrated by the offering of futures by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the proliferation of hedge funds and the embrace of Bitcoin in cash-strapped countries.	2
The Ethereum Foundation and other developers in the open source development community of Ethereum are ready to roll out the first iteration the Metropolis hard fork proposal by next week. According to Jordan Daniell of ETHNews, the Metropolis hard fork is set to be executed in two separate phases. The first iteration of the Metropolis hard fork is called the Byzantine hard fork, a solution that is expected to minimize the actions of bad actors within the Ethereum ecosystem. The Byzantine hard fork will be integrated into Ethereum���s testnet on block number 1,700,000, which could be as early as Sept. 18. In previous interviews with Cointelegraph, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the necessity of a network improvement and the execution of a hard fork in order to provide a more efficient, secure and robust infrastructure for decentralized applications (dapps) and developers. Over the past 12 months, an increasing number of multi-billion dollar financial institutions, Fortune 500 conglomerates and dapp developers have entered the Ethereum ecosystem through various consortia such as the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Companies like JPMorgan, Microsoft, Intel and BBVA are actively developing applications on top of the Ethereum protocol to automate their operations and develop new infrastructures based on the immutable Blockchain network of Ethereum. For the Ethereum network to support all of the incoming large-scale dapps in the near future, especially many dapps that are set to be commercialized and implemented to larger platforms, developers will require a more robust protocol to work with. As Buterin previously explained: ���The applications are there. See: UN world food program, identity, supply chain, prediction markets, decentralized Reddit/Twitter, mesh nets. All are on backburner now precisely because scalability is not there. I personally have cut down evangelism precisely because I see that the main bottleneck is now not interest, but tech.��� Although only the Byzantine hard fork will be tested on Ethereum���s testnet in early next week, a successful testing process of the Byzantine hard fork will allow the Ethereum Foundation and its developers to streamline the integration of the second phase of the Metropolis hard fork. Once the Metropolis hard fork is completed, it would allow most of the decentralized applications Buterin mentioned in the statement above to be commercialized and to be launched in a scalable and efficient ecosystem. In an interview with Cointelegraph in April, Buterin noted that the Ethereum Foundation will continue to improve the core protocol of Ethereum. Once more companies and users develop and explore additional use cases, then the scalability and flexibility of the EThereum network would allow large Blockchain applications to be tested in various industries. ���There are a few perspectives. First of all, we will keep developing the technology and solving pressing challenges, some of them we already started working on, but there is still a lot to be done, including scaling, confidentiality, security issues. These issues need to be solved to ensure further development of the protocol and the whole ecosystem. Besides, we are focusing on the expansion of the system ��� to make sure that more projects are building on top of Ethereum, more companies and users working with the platform, exploring new use cases,��� said Buterin. Many experts including Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam stated that scalability is a major issue for Ethereum if it intends to support large decentralized applications with millions of users. Metropolis is a major step towards scaling the Ethereum network efficiently.	1
Market observers expected hot money to flow from Bitcoin to altcoins after the Segwit2x hardfork was cancelled. Instead, the entire altcoin market seems to have crashed along with Bitcoin, while Bitcoin Cash surges by 55% to reach $992. If altcoin backers hoped that the cancellation of Bitcoin's November Segwit2X hard fork would result in the prices of altcoins increasing, they were sadly mistaken. The crash in price of Bitcoin (down $1,300 in the last two days) has been accompanied by almost altcoins crashing. Out of the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic and Dash have posted gains in the last 24 hours. People who were short Bitcoin and long altcoins were only half right. The divide in Bitcoin was apparent a long time before the Bitcoin Cash fork was created and before Segwit2X was envisaged. The community is split on the issue of blocksize - between those who believe small blocks are essential to maintain decentralization and those who believe that larger blocks are necessary for Bitcoin to scale. The large blockers seem to have been split between the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash camps, with those in the Bitcoin camp pinning their hopes on the implementation of Segwit2X and the blocksize increasing to 2MB. With the collapse of Segwit2X, the Bitcoin Cash camp seems to have been strengthened, increasing its price. Vinny Lingham tweeted to indicate that the move might be happening: Too early to say, but @adam3us & @eric_lombrozo did recommend that those who didn���t support Layer 2 scaling should move to Bitcoin Cash. I guess that���s happening now... Bitcoin Cash was created on August 1 and its market capitalization has zoomed to $16 bln in three months. Bitcoin Cash is now more valuable than Twitter, which currently has a market cap of $15 bln. After an initial crash, Bitcoin Cash has recovered sharply and seems to be uniting those who want Bitcoin to scale through big blocks. It is fast closing in on Ethereum, which has a market capitalization of $28 bln. Ethereum backers expected it to overtake Bitcoin in market cap (the "flippening"), but now have to worry about Bitcoin Cash overtaking Ethereum.	1
The US chief financial watchdog, the Financial Stability Oversight Board (FSOC), claims that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do not pose a threat to existing financial systems around the world. In its 152-page report, the FSOC stated that virtual currencies are only utilized by a very small number of consumers and their underlying Blockchain technology offers potential in various industrial applications. ���Virtual currencies are only used by a very small number of consumers. We give a bit more credit to the potentially much broader applications of the so-called distributed ledger technology underpinning the innovations. It is noteworthy that this digital wave also presents a regulatory challenge, because the storage of data is decentralized, rather than being in one spot that governments can watch.��� The report���s view on digital currencies is somewhat surprising due to the negative stance shown by several financial industry personalities. An example is a recent claim by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, that Bitcoin is a ���fraud��� and should not be taken seriously. The report also cited various monetary threats, geopolitical risks and cybersecurity threats that confront the global financial system. Bitcoin was not cited as a threat. The virtual currency market registered considerable growth throughout 2017. However, despite its phenomenal growth, the market���s total combined value is still significantly below $1 trillion and likely too small to be a systemic threat to the global financial sector. At the same time, the potential that could be unleashed by cryptocurrencies is extreme.	2
Bitcoin���s (BTC) definitive breakout above $50,000 may have to wait longer to materialize as spot buying pressure on Coinbase Pro shows signs of weakening ��� at least in the short term.  The Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the gap between BTC price on Coinbase Pro and Binance, has flipped negative, according to CryptoQuant. In other words, selling pressure on Coinbase appears to be strengthening compared with other exchanges like Binance.  A negative reading on the Coinbase Premium Index could be a precursor to short-term resistance. On the other hand, when the premium is high, it indicates strong spot buying pressure on Coinbase.  Based on the index, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that topping $50,000 ���looks pretty tough��� in the near term.  Breaking 50k looks pretty tough as Coinbase premium becomes -$45Chart https://t.co/gC1Jqrbn9b pic.twitter.com/LyVzZamlta ���Current buying power doesn���t come from Coinbase,��� he added. ���No more Coinbase premium compared to Binance/Huobi/OKEx. Be careful.���  Coinbase has become a major bellwether for Bitcoin demand due to its popularity among large institutional buyers. These market participants acquire their BTC via over-the-counter markets on Coinbase Pro. Although these large purchases don���t immediately impact BTC price, they signify growing demand for the digital asset and, in turn, diminishing supply. The Coinbase Premium Index, therefore, is one way to gauge institutional demand for BTC in the short term. A short-term fluctuation in the Coinbase premium doesn���t appear to have any bearing on Bitcoin���s long-term trajectory. The digital asset remains in a strong uptrend, having peaked well north of $49,700 on Sunday, according to TradingView data. Bitcoin's price has gained a whopping 28% over the past week, thanks in large part to Tesla���s planned acquisition of the asset. Based on the electric vehicle maker���s most recent 10K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, it plans to allocate roughly 7.7% of its gross cash position to Bitcoin. Publicly traded companies and fund managers hold roughly 6% of Bitcoin���s circulating supply ��� a figure that doesn���t include Tesla���s $1.5 billion position.	0
France���s Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire has appointed an open Bitcoin critic to head a task force examining cryptocurrency regulation, local source Les Echos reports Monday, Jan. 15. Jean-Pierre Landau, who called Bitcoin ���the tulips of modern times��� four years ago, will now head France���s efforts to ���better control��� its regulatory evolution. ���We want a stable economy,��� minister Le Maire told reporters in a session during which he announced Landau���s appointment. ���We cannot allow speculative risk and the possibility of misappropriation [of funds] linked to Bitcoin.��� Despite Landau���s past opposition, Les Echos describes him as ���Monsieur Bitcoin,��� Mister Bitcoin. Landau���s tasks will also involve researching how French authorities can stop ���tax evasion, money laundering and criminal and terrorist activity financing��� using cryptocurrency. Le Maire himself has become a vocal proponent of legislative improvements for cryptocurrency at an international level in recent months. In December, he announced his desire for Bitcoin to be a topic of debate at the forthcoming G20 Summit in Argentina scheduled for March. ���There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate Bitcoin,��� he told local news network LCI.	0
There is no chance that the cryptocurrency and blockchain space will see ���1,000-times growth��� again, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated in an interview with Bloomberg September 8. At an Ethereum and blockchain conference in Hong Kong, Buterin told Bloomberg that the rapid growth of crypto and blockchain industry is now reaching a ���ceiling,��� and is moving from ���just people being interested��� to the stage of ���real applications of real economic activity.��� Buterin explained that the period of explosive growth in the sphere is likely coming to an end because the level of superficial awareness about the industry has significantly grown, and is likely to plateau: ���If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn���t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore.��� According to Buterin, the initial strategy seen over the past six or seven years in the crypto community ��� based on marketing coins with the goal of widespread adoption ��� has resulted in massive growth price and market capitalization of many cryptocurrencies, but that it is now ���getting close to hitting a dead end.��� Crypto markets have seen a dramatic decline in terms of total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies during 2018. In January, total market cap of all cryptocurrencies hit $828 billion point. The peak in total market cap has been followed by a gradual downturn ��� with a rebound upwards in May ��� that has led to the current figure of $198.8 billion, the lowest point since  early November 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.  1-year total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies chart. Source: CoinMarketCap However, while crypto markets have seen a significant decline in 2018, the current figures are still much more than those in the beginning of 2017, when total market capitalization stood at around $17-20 billion, and major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum were mostly trading below $1,000 and $12, respectively. In this regard, ���Bitcoin Jesus��� Roger Ver recently told Cointelegraph that the recent bear market ���feels like the opposite of a crash,��� since ���BTC is up 58% for the last year, and 1048% for the last two years.��� In the bearish marketplace, various experts have suggested different scenarios for the dynamics of crypto prices at the end of 2018. In late August, Fundstrat���s Tom Lee claimed that the BTC ���could end the year explosively higher,��� citing a correlation between it and emerging markets and predicting that Bitcoin���s price could surge to as high as $25,000 this year. In July, Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of both Reddit and VC firm Initialized Capital reiterated his stance that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be trading at $20,000 and $1,500 by the end of 2018, respectively. Also in July, Julian Hosp, co-founder and president of crypto startup TenX claimed that he was still ���quite confident��� that Bitcoin can hit $60,000 in 2018.	0
PayPal���s chief financial officer, John Rainey, spoke positively of Bitcoin���s (BTC) use as a future popular option for payments during an interview with The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published Monday, Feb. 19. In a section of the interview entitled, �����he crypto factor,��� Rainey said that PayPal was one of the first companies to accept Bitcoin on their Braintree platform back in 2015. However, Rainey adds: ���Given the volatility of bitcoin right now, it���s not a reliable currency for transactions because if you���re a merchant and you have a 10% profit margin, and you accept bitcoin, and the very next day bitcoin drops 15%, you are now underwater on that transaction.��� In response to the question if cryptocurrencies will ever be popular as a payments, Rainey tells WSJ that there is ���a very high likelihood��� of that happening: ���The technology, there is real merit to it. I do think, though, it will be years down the road before we see the kind of ubiquity and acceptance that make it a form of currency that is used every day.��� PayPal co-founder Max Levchin said in December of last year that while he thinks Blockchain technology is revolutionary, he hasn���t ���figure[d] out��� his views on Bitcoin���s future yet. Coinbase, a cryptocurrency wallet and exchange platform, added former PayPal executive David Marcus to its board of directors last December.	2
After a relatively low start to the month in the crypto market, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has again broken $500 bln today, Feb. 17, according to CoinMarketCap. The total market cap is currently around $502 bln at press time. Bitcoin (BTC) has stayed well above the $10,000 mark, currently trading at about $10,830 and up almost 7 percent over a 24-hour period by press time. Ethereum (ETH) is inching closer to passing the $1000 threshold, trading at $969, up almost 3 percent over a 24-hour period by press time.  Of the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap, only Litecoin (LTC) is in the red, down about 3 percent at press time. Earlier week Litecoin saw a surge in price following the announcement of the upcoming launch of a LTC-fiat payment service, and a planned hard fork that Litecoin creator called a ���scam���. LTC is currently trading at around $227. The steady uptick in prices may have prompted by the bullish news that an anonymous trader purchased around 41,000 Bitcoin between Feb. 9 and Feb. 12, worth around $440 mln today, Marketwatch reported. The purchase reportedly brought the BTC address total up to over 96,000 BTC, or little over $1 bln.	2
J.P. Morgan has called cryptocurrencies the ���innovative maelstrom��� around Blockchain and said they are ���unlikely to disappear��� in what appears to be an internal report from the company, published Feb. 8, 2018. In an extract from what is allegedly the banking giant���s executive summary on cryptocurrency, the company appears bullish on crypto���s future. ���Cryptocurrencies are the face of the innovative maelstrom around the Blockchain technology that is bringing both massive price volatility and a constant trial-and-error of new product try-outs and failures,��� the report states. Despite the report���s mixed tone, the distinction from J.P. Morgan���s public position on cryptocurrency over the past six months is palpable. In September, 2017 J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon became notorious after he called Bitcoin a ���fraud,��� triggering the very price volatility the bank now cites as a ���challenge��� crypto assets face. Dimon subsequently claimed he was ���not going to talk about Bitcoin anymore,��� while last month publicly disclosing he ���regretted��� making the fraud comments. Speaking to Cointelegraph at the World Economic Forum in January, 2018, Dimon flatly refuted the idea that he was a ���skeptic��� on Bitcoin. The recently published report meanwhile offers ideas as to how cryptocurrencies could be used most effectively. ���CCs [Cryptocurrencies] are unlikely to disappear and could easily survive in varying forms and shapes among players who desire greater decentralization, peer-to-peer networks and anonymity, even as the latter is under threat,��� the summary continues in a positive vein. ���The underlying technology for CCs [cryptocurrencies] could have the greatest application in areas where current payment systems are slow, such as across borders, as payment, reward tokens or funding systems for other Blockchain innovations and the Internet of Things, as well as parts of the underground economy.��� Last week J.P. Morgan was one of several US banks to ban clients from purchasing cryptocurrency with credit cards.	2
The 1inch.exchange protocol, a platform that aggregates decentralized exchanges and provides its own automated market maker, is airdropping a new stash of its 1INCH tokens. The airdrop follows the initial generation of the new tokens on Christmas, which were distributed to past users of the aggregator. A common point of contention for the initial airdrop was the exclusion of Mooniswap users and liquidity providers, as the project's AMM platform was superseded by an integrated 1inch Liquidity Protocol. The new airdrop, which was already delivered at 5 PM UTC, retroactively distributes tokens to anyone who interacted with Mooniswap before Dec. 24. About 4.8 million tokens will be distributed to 9,094 users of Mooniswap. This amounts to 527 1INCH worth about $3,000. Another 3.57 million tokens were given to 1,308 participants of an earlier liquidity mining program in November. Finally, 310,000 tokens were delivered to limit order users and another 375,000 to users of smart contract wallets like Argent, Authereum, Gnosis and Pillar ��� as long they would have been eligible for the initial airdrop if they used normal wallets. Lastly, the project distributed 6 million 1INCH tokens to particularly active Uniswap traders. To receive the airdrop, the traders must have interacted with Uniswap in at least 20 separate days, and have done at least three trades in 2021. In addition, the wallets must not have interacted with either 1inch or Mooniswap in the past. According to a 1inch spokesperson, there are about 25,000 such addresses, entitling each to 240 tokens or $1,350 at current prices. The airdrop looks to entice active Uniswap traders to try 1inch, the spokesperson said. To claim the airdrop, these users must connect their wallet to the protocol, which should familiarize them with the interface. Airdrops to users of other protocols are not a new concept. BadgerDAO���s airdrop, for example, gave tokens to power users of DeFi ��� governance participants in various protocols, as well as minters and users of various Bitcoin (BTC) wrappers on Ethereum.  Usually, these airdrops were meant to properly seed initial token supplies, so that only active participants in DeFi would receive them. The airdrop conducted by 1inch now has one specific purpose: Stealing some users from Uniswap. Uniswap is no stranger to other protocols trying to undermine it. SushiSwap was born as an attempt to steal Uniswap liquidity, since its yield farming program specifically required using Uniswap pool tokens. The idea was that Uniswap liquidity providers would be automatically migrated to SushiSwap, though in the end most of the capital farming SUSHI was brought by outsiders, and the ���vampire attack��� ended up arguably strengthening Uniswap.  It is generally believed that the UNI airdrop, which popularized the concept of rewarding past users for basic actions, was a response to SushiSwap���s unsuccessful attack. In an ironic twist of fate, Uniswap���s airdrop playbook is now being used against it by another competitor.	2
The dedicated session involving the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is taking place Tuesday, Feb. 6. The written testimonies of Jay Clayton and J. Christopher Giancarlo, the chairmen of the SEC and the CFTC respecitvely, have been released to the public. Cryptocurrency users have reacted calmly to the major meeting of US regulators in which they discussed cryptocurrencies, ICOs and ETFs. In lengthy testimony already available for viewing, SEC chairman Jay Clayton reiterates concerns about the need to distinguish between ICOs as securities and non-securities, and hints markets remain unprepared for Bitcoin ETFs in the near-term. Clayton states: ���Investors should understand that to date no ICOs have been registered with the SEC, and the SEC also has not approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies. If any person today says otherwise, investors should be especially wary.��� The path toward the joint discussion with CTFC chairman Christopher Giancarlo has seen both pave the way for ongoing scrutiny of cryptocurrency in US markets. A co-authored article in the Wall Street Journal outlined both officials��� perspectives on the topic, appearing during the World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos last month. During that event, politicians and lawmakers from multiple jurisdictions voiced a desire for an international regulatory effort on crypto, something which should take center stage at March���s G20 Summit in Buenos Aires.	1
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has burned nearly half of the supply of the popular Dogecoin (DOGE) clone Shiba Inu (SHIB). In a statement embedded into the transaction on Sunday, Buterin explained why he had decided to burn $6.7 billion worth of SHIB tokens, emphasizing the ���generosity��� of the ���dog token communities.��� The recent dog-themed bull run came to an abrupt end on Wednesday as Buterin liquidated trillions of the tokens he was gifted by Shiba���s creators and donated the proceeds to charity. The Ethereum co-founder said he had decided to burn the remaining 90% of Shiba tokens in his wallet and allocate the remaining 10% to charitable causes. He added that charities with similar values as CryptoRelief ��� an Indian organization focused on supporting COVID-19 relief through crypto-asset donations ��� would be considered as potential recipients. Buterin noted that simply holding the coins entrusted to him was not an option for security reasons, adding that he wanted to avoid the frenzied speculation that could arise from him making transactions using the dog tokens in the future. He also asked people not to donate any more tokens to him as he did not want to be a ���locus of power of that kind.���  The Shiba Inu token prices went ballistic when it was listed on Binance last week amid the surging popularity of Dogecoin and other dog tokens. The surge in canine-themed meme token trading was blamed for the recent spike in Ethereum network fees ��� which hit an average all-time high of $70 on Wednesday. At the time of writing, SHIB has retreated 7% in 24 hours amid the latest crypto crash triggered by anti-Bitcoin sentiment expressed by the Twitter account of Elon Musk.  Bitcoin has retreated 7% over the past 24 hours to $44,600 as of this writing.	1
The US Senate Judiciary Committee is currently tackling bill S.1241 that aims to criminalize the intentional concealment of ownership or control of a financial account. The bill also would amend the definition of ���financial account��� and ���financial institution��� to include digital currencies and digital exchanges, respectively. According to ranking committee member Senator Dianne Feinstein, the proposed bill is needed to modernize existing AML laws. The bill would amend the definition of ���financial institution,��� in Section 53412(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include: ���An issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.��� If passed, the bill would likely have far-reaching effects for users of digital currencies both in the US and abroad. Several industry commentators have issued their opinions on the proposed law. Tone Vays claimed that he expects a confrontation between the Bitcoin team, including the holders and users, and the US government. ���It���s bad���I think it���s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin���even Bitcoin holders and users���and the US Government.��� In his testimony during the hearing, John A. Cassara claimed that the issue of virtual currencies is interesting: ���Senator, I���m just glad I had my career when I did because I don���t know what I���d do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it���s extremely, extremely challenging���I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That���s not to say it���s gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We���re right at a crossroads, and it���s going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.��� Earlier reports also indicate that the White House is actively monitoring cryptocurrencies which could only mean more attempts to regulate the world���s first successful decentralized monetary system. With the growing involvement of Wall Street and the ever escalating media attention, it is not surprising that governments are stepping up their attempts to regulate digital currency.	0
Rumors are circulating that Amazon may begin accepting Bitcoin as a payment method this October. The rumors appear to stem from a recent report on squawker.org, Some surveys have indicated that the company would have a financial reason to do so, but no official announcement has been made.   The squawker.org article references a mention in investor James Altucher���s newsletter. According to the source, Altucher is an experienced trader who many believe could have pre-announcement information. The article comments: ���James Altucher has (co)founded more than 20 companies, authored 11 books, and has been a contributor to several major publications.He is a former hedge fund manager and venture capitalist turned activist blogger/podcaster and offers a subscription based mailing list ��� the source of the Amazon information.��� Such an announcement is a long shot, but isn���t inconceivable. As online retailers begin to embrace Bitcoin, Amazon will likely respond in kind, in order to maintain its dominance. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said: ���They have to follow suit. I���d be stunned if they don���t, because they can���t just cede that part of the market to us, if we���re the only main, large retail site accepting Bitcoin.��� The move would also continue a trend that began with Overstock and has included other enterprise-level tech companies. A recent comment within a Google API tutorial has led many to believe that the online behemoth will also begin accepting Bitcoin within the Google Store, as PayPal and others already do. As recently as this summer, users were petitioning Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, to begin accepting the cryptocurrency. The move may occur as early as October 26th, during the next earnings conference call. It should be reiterated that this is likely only a rumor at this point, and could be swiftly put to rest. Nonetheless, it is interesting to speculate on the possibilities if Amazon does one day integrate Bitcoin. As the adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies grow, retailers will need to join the progression toward acceptance in order to remain relevant.	1
The emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) has been predicted by the Final Fantasy III video game released 28 years ago, according to a recent joke post on Reddit which has managed to amass more than three thousand upvotes as of April 18. The post refers to a symbol that looks similar to Bitcoin���s logo, pictured on an object in the game that was originally released on April 27, 1990.  The first Bitcoin block was mined on Jan. 3, 2009, making the appearance of the symbol in Final Fantasy III an apparent coincidence. However, this is not the first such coincidence discovered by the members of the Bitcoin community. Some have seen parallels to Bitcoin in books, such as Neal Stephenson���s ���Cryptonomicon��� published in 2002, ���Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom��� written in 2003 by Cory Doctorow, who described a Bitcoin-like currency Whuffie, and ���Future Imperfect��� by David D. Friedman published in 2008. In 1999, American economist and Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences Milton Friedman predicted the rise of digital currencies like Bitcoin. In an interview with NTU/F, Friedman suggested a way of payment in the future that would represent ���A method where buying on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A.��� Another ���prediction��� was found in episode of The Simpsons, showing Homer and Marge in front of a store sign reading ���Crypto Barn���. The store described itself as ���A place for codes.��� The episode ���My Sister, My Sitter��� was first aired on March 2, 1997.	1
Earth Hour, a grassroots movement within the World Wildlife Fund to turn off all electricity for a single hour once a year as a way to draw attention to energy consumption, will be celebrated by Russian miners this year as well with the creation of ���Crypto Hour,��� local news outlet Rambler reported March 15. In order to remind the crypto sphere of the need for more ecologically friendly Blockchain  technologies, Russian crypto miners have asked all miners internationally to turn off their mining equipment on March 24, from 20:30 - 21:30 (local time). The Crypto Hour campaign is led by Peter Dvoryankin, the founder of international investor network CryptoLife and a member of the Russian Duma���s expert council for fintech development. Dvoryankin told Rambler that the goal of the campaign is to create ���ecological mining��� maps that will show the most ecologically-friendly places for crypto mining due to their proximity to renewable energy sources in areas with the right temperatures. Dvoryankin added that the campaigns also calls for ���the creation of systems to use the heat generated in the process of mining and develop less energy-intensive distributed ledger technologies.��� Rambler notes that the Bitcoin (BTC) network already uses more than 50 terawatt hours of energy a year, adding that if the usage continues at the current rate then BTC mining will use as much electricity as the rest of the world combined by 2020. It was reported already in February that crypto mining in Iceland will be using more energy than all of the households in the country in 2018. The Russian site for Earth Hour shows that over 50,000 people have promised online to participate in the hour-long blackout, whose motto is ���Vote for Nature,��� while Rambler cites the number of Russians planning to participate as over 30 mln. The website also allows participants to vote for protecting natural land reserves, using green energy and recycling, with their votes sent to the future president of Russia. The problem of what to do with the excess energy made by mining has been solved in an innovative way by one Czech Blockchain startup that plans to use this surplus to heat greenhouses to grow edible crops. However, one clean energy mining initiative was blocked in Europe after one of Europe���s largest power utility companies refused to sell renewable energy to crypto mining company Envion this February.	1
Golem, the Airbnb of computing has set yet another record. It appreciated 15.49 percentage points to dislodge MaidSafeCoin from the tenth spot on CoinMarketCap on Friday morning Eastern Time. The Ethereum Token took many people in the industry by surprise when it rose almost 100 percent in February to be at number eleven. Since then, it has not disappointed its holders and investors. It, therefore, did not flabbergast many when it made it to the first ten today. When Cointelegraph reached out to Julian Zawistowski, CEO and founder of the Golem Project, he was elated but cautious as usual. "This is exciting. But I think we should not get too excited but keep our focus on advancing the technology. I believe that applies to the whole industry," Julian told Cointelegraph. This was his response when asked whether top ten status won't be a flash in the pan: "If you ask me about the future rationality of the crypto market and sanity/insanity of the valuations, the answer is: I do not know. If you ask me about what we are going to do within Golem project, the answer is: we are working hard." There are so many instances where altcoins made it to the elite ranks of CoinMarketCap, only for them to disappear in a short while into the lower echelons never to be seen again. However, Nick Kirk aka ���Mintegration���, a veteran of IBM Research, who also holds a substantial number of Golem token believes in the case of Golem it is antithetic.  He explained: "I love what Golem is doing, and I'm genuinely interested in HPC.(High-Performance Computing) This space is ripe for disruption. I hold a good proportion of my capital in GNT. I'm going to support the network as much as I can. I'll be working on a proof of concept (PoC) very soon - using Golem for Machine Learning tasks (e.g. training my models). No-one knows how much GNT could rise, but it has tremendous potential. If you look at the other top ten coins, Golem is one of the few with real utility." Nick urged the community members to buy some GNT and support Golem since it is the coolest network in the crypto land. It is his conviction that the network's growth rate will be very significant in the coming years. If you have observed MaidsafeCoin whom Golem displaced from the tenth position, it is one of the most resilient cryptocurrencies around. Anytime it is dislodged, it comes back strongly to takes its former position. It won't be a surprise to see the Scottish darling boy taking over number 10 again but Golem seems to mean business looking at its growth rate since the February bang that gave it recognition and respect in the ecosystem. In fact, the difference in market cap between the two cryptos is less $1 mln. As usual, only time will tell if Golem will survive as an elite digital currency. Cointelegraph will always keep you updated with the important developments.	1
A recent Bitcoin (BTC) technical analysis reportedly prepared by CitiFX for its institutional clients points to a potential high of $318,000 sometime in December 2021. In a supposed note to clients seen by Twitter commentator Alex on Nov. 14,  Citibank managing director Tom Fitzpatrick looks at the long-term trend of Bitcoin price, characterized as it has been by ���unthinkable rallies followed by painful corrections.��� Notably, the three major bullish periods of BTC so far have been increasing in length. Initially, there was a 10-month run from 2010���2011, followed by a two-year run from 2011���2013, and finally a three-year run covering 2015���2017. Conversely, Fitzpatrick posits that the period of correction following the last two bull runs has remained stable at around 12 months. This, according to the analysis, places us squarely in the middle of a bull run which started in early 2019 and is potentially set to run for four years until late 2022. It could be argued that such an extended bull run would lead to even higher levels, and charting ���what looks like a very well defined channel��� over the past seven years gives Fitzpatrick his prediction of a $318,000 Bitcoin price in December 2021. While conceding that this figure may seem highly improbable, he points out that this ���would only be a low to high rally of 102 times (the weakest rally so far in percentage terms) at a point where the arguments in favour of Bitcoin could well be at their most persuasive ever.��� These arguments include a change in the United States Federal Reserve���s monetary policy which occurred when the coronavirus pandemic hit. This was characterized by a vast and sustained increase in new money production, with less intention to constrain this once the economy and employment pick up again. Cointelegraph has reached out to Citibank for further comment on the report but has not received a response as of publishing time.	1
So here is the thing that most people don���t understand is going on when it comes to crypto currencies, Bitcoin, Blockchain, and especially ICO���s. Many people are star-struck with the gains made in 2017 with $2 bln invested into ICOs and think this is a breakthrough moment. Let me tell you it is not. We haven���t seen anything yet as 2018 will dwarf 2017 advancements by a factor of x10 or x20. In 2018 there will be $20 bln to $25 bln invested in ICOs and it won���t stop there as the major pieces start to fall into place as the real big game unfolds. Then kaaaaBOOM! The market cap if crypto will explode and pass $500 mln, and start to head to $1 tln. But how - I hear you say? Simply through institutional money, which is ready, willing, and able to pile in. So what happens to the price of crypto, to BTC? Doubles, trebles and more���overnight. The crypto indexes will polarise into securities that tokenise assets as well as equities, and those that don���t, with app tokens that are products and services. How do I know? All we have to do is create the conditions. We have done just that, a new approach to ICOs starting from the perspective of regulation and compliance where we are able to meet the needs of institutional investors, which opens the flood gates. Fractional Reserve Banking will continue to fall apart aa QE further devalues fiat currency and erodes spending power. More and more people will buy into crypto as the people look for safe havens. Russia, Japan and other sovereign nations will issue a full central-backed cryptocurrency that will be fungible against BTC and the leading cryptos. A new range of Blockchain/crypto funds will offer investors the opportunity to buy the market and reduce underlying volatility. Market actors make it more attractive for investors to get involved in crypto, where even a small strip will boost any portfolio���s performance. The planets are aligning very fast as all assets and especially equities will be tokenised which will displace the Ponzi scheme VC boys once and for all, and ICOs take over as the preferred method to raise capital. The shift is coming sooner than you think��� be ready! "Ignorance is strengthened." It is time to plan for the bigger picture and make your move...	1
Former Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager and Real Vision founder Raoul Pal believes that the social media pundits are wrong and that the crypto market cycle won���t end this year.  But things might get a bit hairy on the way.  In a Real Vision interview on Wednesday, Pal predicted that the current bull run won���t end in December, as it did spectacularly in 2015 and 2017, and will instead extend to some time between March and June.  According to Pal, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and altcoin markets are likely to ���take the path of most pain,��� potentially crashing twice over the next six months.  Cointelegraph reported on Thursday that on-chain data source Ecoinometrics data suggests that if the current cycle follows the same pattern as in 2017, the next BTC price peak could be as much as $253,800. Over the course of 2021, Pal has become increasingly bullish on Ether, describing it in August as ���the greatest trade.��� He said that the upcoming launch of Ethereum 2.0 and the potential launch of an Ether exchange-traded fund in the first half of 2022 may be catalysts for a massive rally, broadening access to the crypto market and attracting large institutions. ���Everybody is staking their ETH. It���s creating this incredible supply and demand imbalance in ETH where there���s only about 11% of the total ETH supply available. Everything else is locked up for this staking,��� he said.  ���All of that means that we���re likely to see an extended cycle, and I think it extends into between March and June, and that would be a new phase.��� Bitcoin was created in 2008 and, so far, has moved in market cycles of approximately four years around the halving, which is when the mining block reward is cut in half, reducing the BTC supply.  Halvings occurred in 2012 and 2016 with the last halving happening in May 2020. While Bitcoin is up 7.3 times since, an increasing number of analysts think that with mainstream adoption, the cycles will no longer dominate.	1
While Bitcoin (BTC) dominance is up and Bitcoin transaction fees are down, the crypto market is seeing an overall downturn by press time, Wednesday, Feb. 21, with all of the top 30 coins on CoinMarketCap in the red. Bitcoin dominance, or BTC���s market cap as a share of the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies, is at a monthly highly today of around 39.4 percent, corresponding with the recent sharp drop in Bitcoin transaction fees. A year ago today, BTC had about 86 percent market dominance, a figure that has been falling on average ever since, despite its short rise up to 66 percent in early December.  Bitcoin transaction fees had seen all-time highs in January 2018, rising to about $37 for a fee that would have your transaction mined fastest, on the next mined block.  However, Bitcoin���s last transaction fee as recorded by Blockchair was $0.36/kB at 3:11pm UTC, Feb. 21, a 6-month lows for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a well-known Bitcoin hard fork that took place August 2017, has positioned itself as superior to Bitcoin in part because of having lower transaction fees than BTC. Bitcoin Cash���s last transaction fee recorded at by Blockchair at 3:28pm UTC is in fact slightly lower than Bitcoin at $0.22/kB. However, other transactions made this afternoon showed fees of as high as $0.91/kB. Crypto investor and evangelist Roger Ver, arguably the most well-known and active proponent of BCH, tweeted last week about the benefits of BCH over BTC, calling Bitcoin, ���slow, expensive to use, and unreliable for transactions.��� Twitter user UFoundMe commented on the tweet on Feb. 18 with an image capture showing the average fees of BCH and BTC converging: Now What? pic.twitter.com/M6NjYwmy3Y Bitcoin is currently trading at around $10,675, down about 9 percent over a 24-hour period by press time. Bitcoin Cash is down a little more than 14 percent over a 24-hour period, trading around $1,302 by press time. Total market cap is around $457 bln, down from last week���s high over $500 bln.  Support for the Bitcoin scalability upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit), which is designed to make transaction fees slower and transactions times faster on the Bitcoin network, was added to the latest Bitcoin Core client version released on Feb. 15, 2018. SegWit support was also added to major exchange Bitfinex today, Feb. 21, and scheduled to be released on the exchange and wallet platform Coinbase by mid-next week.	0
Wall Street���s traders Mike Komaransky and Chase Lochmiller have achieved greater financial success by trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They���re not the only ones withdrawing their funds from stocks. In fact, CNBC reports that many stock traders are pulling out their billions from the stock market. One of the traders, Komaransky, has reportedly done so well that he already announced his retirement at the age of 38 in the summer of 2017. On June 30, 2017, Komaransky tweets: After 16 years of trading, today is my last day at @Cumberland_BTC and @DRWTrading. Good luck to the crew, I wish you the best. Komaransky became interested in Bitcoin after reading George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen���s blog about the digital currency in 2010. Komaransky was working in London, England during that time. In late 2013, the price of Bitcoin started its upward mobility following the collapse of the biggest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox. Due to the continuous rise of Bitcoin���s price, high-frequency trading company DRW Holdings founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Don Wilson, has ordered Komaransky to establish cryptocurrency trading currency subsidiary Cumberland Mining in 2014. Cumberland Mining was able to exploit the volatile era of Bitcoin trading as it was successful in making notable trades such as gaining the bulk of tokens auctioned by the US Marshals Service. The coins were seized by the service from dark market operator Ross Ulbricht and the illegal online black market he established, Silk Road. Cumberland Mining has sustained its success and is now one of the biggest digital currency market makers. The company currently has 12 employees, who are mainly involved in trading cryptocurrencies such Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the past 10 years, Lochmiller has worked for the largest high-frequency trading companies on Wall Street such as Jump Trading and Getco. In July 2017, however, he resigned at Jump Trading to join hedge fund Polychain Capital, which is mainly involved in trading virtual currencies like Tezos and Ethereum.	2
The XRP token���s market capitalization has fallen almost $130 billion since its all-time high in 2018, making the cryptocurrency project���s decline comparable to the collapse of major financial institutions. According to Josh Frank of crypto-focused research company The TIE, the project is experiencing a collapse similar to some of the biggest corporate scandals and catastrophes in recent history. XRP's market cap has fallen by 93% from $137B to under $10B. That makes the value of the XRP collapse bigger than Enron and Worldcom. While not a bankruptcy, XRP is effectively the third largest collapse of all time behind Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. At its peak, XRP���s market capitalization was roughly $140 billion in January 2018. It has recently slipped under $10 billion, an estimated loss of $130 billion in under three years. This effectively makes the ���collapse��� of XRP third behind only the $327 billion bankruptcy of Washington Mutual and the failure of investment giant Lehman Brothers ��� a financial meltdown valued at $691 billion ��� in 2008. ���It is sad and unfortunate that the biggest losers in the [XRP] saga are the individual investors who lost unimaginable amounts of money,��� Frank told Cointelegraph. ���The founders of Ripple continued to dump their tokens for years and made hundreds of millions of dollars.��� Following the news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would charge Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen with conducting an "unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering" for their XRP sales, the token price has dropped precipitously. Crypto exchanges including Coinbase, Bittrex, OKCoin, Bitstamp, OSL, Beaxy, and CrossTower later announced they would suspend trading for XRP or delist the token entirely, providing additional bearish fuel. Institutional players have also started distancing themselves from XRP. Grayscale Investments��� website now states that its ���XRP Trust private placement is currently closed" with one Twitter user claiming the firm would also no longer process pending applications for the XRP Trust. At the time of publication, the price of XRP is $0.21, having fallen more than 65% in the last 30 days.	0
Many late adopters of Bitcoin often lament the fact they missed out on the chance to purchase coins when the price was under $1,000, $100, or even $1. However, one Redditor says his own situation is even worse as he���s forced to compare his ���dumb��� decision to invest in silver against his twin brother���s much wiser decision to back Bitcoin.  The story ��� which may be apocryphal given the source is a throwaway account named ���TheDumbTwin��� ��� claims the two brothers each received a $100,000 inheritance in 2013 but took drastically different financial paths. ���I���ve been a silver bug, and I argued that silver was, IMO, the best alternative investment to stocks and bonds,��� said the Redditor.  TheDumbTwin claimed that despite his protests, his brother invested roughly $50,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) when the price was $100 (the crypto asset stayed below $200 until late October 2013) meaning he may have purchased around 500 BTC. With Bitcoin recently topping the 2017 (former) all-time high the coins would be worth roughly $9.6 million today.  The twin claims his brother���s investments are now valued at more than $10 million, while the $30,000 he chose to put into silver has dropped to $26,000 in value. In January 2013, silver was worth more than $30 per ounce, while today the precious metal is roughly $24 per ounce.  ���His wealth in Bitcoin alone is more than 100 times greater than my entire net worth,��� he said.  While the story cannot be independently verified, the concept of missed opportunities is one which Bitcoiners are familiar with, given the crypto asset is within striking distance of $20,000 for the first time in three years. Redditors were quick to offer their thoughts and advice: ���Pretty much every single day of your life, you miss out on an investment opportunity that could make you millions,��� said jackgundy.  ���Never put all of your eggs in one basket,��� said spatialsilver88. ���You didn't have to choose between silver and crypto. You could have done both." Unlike well-known twins in the crypto space like Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss whose wealth appears to have risen in tandem given they founded Gemini together, the ���dumb��� twin claims he ���can���t get over the overwhelming thought��� of why he didn���t take the same financial path as his brother. ���I try to be thankful for what I do have, and I try to be thankful since I know that many other people in the world have it way worse,��� he said. ���But I don���t know if I���ll ever get over it.��� Redditor folkwoodswest, summed it up best with a quote attributed to U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt:	1
Shares of Longfin, a small publicly traded financial company, surged an astonishing 1,342 percent after news that the company would be purchasing a cryptocurrency company with no current value. The explosion in share price brings the market cap for the company from $220 mln to $3.1 bln, a number which the CEO, Venkat Meenavalli, finds substantially overvalued. He told CNBC: "We are a profitable company. ... We have nothing to do with this euphoric mania. This market cap is not justified. I valued my IPO pricing at $5." According to the report, the share price jumped from $5.45 on Thursday last week to $72.38 on Monday, after the announcement that the company would purchase Ziddu, a Singapore-based micro-lending platform on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Of concern for some investors was the later discovery that Meenavalli owns 95% of the Ziddu parent company, Meridian. The news adds fuel to the fire of some cryptocurrency naysayers who believe the market is in a state of mania right now, due to the start of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange this week. However, other industry insiders disagree, at least in part. For example, Sergei Vasin, Blackmoon Crypto's COO told Cointelegraph: ���It seems that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are stealing the show when it comes to making financial headlines. Wall Street has been watching the crypto marketplace mature with interest, waiting for Main Street���s acceptance. The velocity of inflation we are seeing now in the crypto market, is a direct response for all the added capital entering it - seemingly simultaneously. Wall Street  is ready to accept the advantages and benefits that DLT and security/fund tokenization has to offer. This new phase of mainstream acceptance has only just begun.���	2
The single largest Ethereum contract containing 8,641,954 Ether (ETH) worth $33.5 billion is sitting idle because it cannot be spent or sent. A Twitter user highlighted the Beacon chain contract, claiming it to be the largest Ethereum contract with billions of dollars worth of ETH ���trapped��� inside it.  BREAKING: 8,641,954 ETH ($32 billion) trapped in single largest Ethereum contract and unable to be sent or spent. Will require hard fork that hasn't been written or specified yet. Timing and terms of hard fork still unknown.https://t.co/xcXPwbS93v The contract in question is an Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain staking contract launched in November 2020, and it cannot be spent without a hard fork. What makes this even more astonishing is the fact that the terms of the hard fork are yet to be decided, and people sending their ETH into the contract were well aware of the fact. The terms of the hard fork could be decided once the Beacon Chain merges with the Ethereum mainnet. The Beacon Chain is the first key step in Ethereum���s move from a proof-of-work mining consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one. In order to become a validator in Eth2, a trader must stake a minimum of 32 ETH. Thus, the $33.5 billion worth of ETH in the largest Beacon Chain contract shows the high demand and trust in the upcoming Eth2. At the start of December, Ethereum developers called upon community members to test the merger to PoS-based Eth2. The testing phase has been divided into three phases, namely for non-technical users, developers with limited experience in blockchain, and highly technical and experienced blockchain developers. The merger of the Beacon Chain into the Ethereum mainnet would complete the transition to PoS Eth2. The official Ethereum.org page for Eth2 suggests the merger could be completed by Q1 or Q2 of 2022.	1
The executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation Llew Claasen predicted that the price of Bitcoin will hit $40,000 by the end of 2018, while 90% of all other cryptocurrency projects will fail, Business Insider reported Feb. 15. As Claasen stated at the Startup Grind conference which took place Feb. 12-14, this failure will be caused by investors taking too much risk investing in cryptocurrency projects which later turn out to be scams. Only a month and a half into 2018, five major Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and cryptocurrency scams have already been discovered, including the notorious case of Bitconnect. Claasen is confident that the cryptocurrency community will learn from these unfortunate occurrences and will be able to prevent them in future, as he told Business Insider. Claasen believes that investors are already being more careful, declaring that ���this is a problem the market is good at solving." As Claasen further explained, Bitcoin will not be gradually growing to the value of $40,000 over the course of 2018. Instead, it will be bouncing for three to six months with the same ups and downs as during the previous three months. Just this Tuesday, the CEO of Ripple Brad Garlinghouse similarly said that most virtual currencies will likely go to zero, as reported by Business Insider.	1
Bittrex, the US-based Bitcoin and altcoin exchange has announced its official position on Bitcoin Gold. The exchange, widely regarded as a substantial player in the marketplace, had previously hesitated issuing a formal statement. However, with the hard fork just a short time away, Bittrex has finally clarified its position on the coming fork. Per the statement, Bittrex will perform a ���wallet snapshot��� at the time of the hard fork, which will occur at block 491,407. At that time, each BTC will receive an equivalent BTG. According to the statement: ���If you have a Bitcoin (BTC) balance on Bittrex during the BTG snapshot block 491,407 occurring approximately on October 24, 3am PT (10am UTC), you will be additionally credited the equivalent amount of Bitcoin Gold (BTG) on a 1:1 basis. i.e. 1 BTC on Bittrex held during the on-exchange snapshot will get you 1 BTG.  BTC held on orders will also be credited.  Only the BTC held on your account is eligible for BTG.��� The exchange���s statement gave users a number of warnings about the forthcoming Bitcoin Gold currency. To wit: ���Bitcoin Gold does not currently have: Bitcoin Gold codebase also contains a private premine of 8,000 blocks (100,000 BTG). Please be aware that if a market does open there is a possibility of the developers selling their premined BTG on the open market.��� Bittrex noted that Bitcoin Gold does not meet the necessary requirements to be listed on its exchange. They also pointed out that taking a snapshot of user balances is extremely disruptive and they will have to suspend all deposits and withdrawals 24 hours before the snapshot is taken. Nevertheless, in spite of Bittrex���s reservations about the currency and the difficulty involved in creating the snapshot, the exchange appears committed to ensuring its users receive the appropriate amount of Bitcoin Gold.	1
The European Commission announced it will remove a number of Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messaging system. The move is aimed at hindering Russia���s capacity to carry out cross-border payments. A joint statement released by the European Commission and leaders from France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States highlights the shared interest in defending Ukraine from Russia: In addition to condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin���s move to attack Ukraine, the European Commission committed to undertaking a series of measures to isolate Russia from the international financial system.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced five proactive measures against Russian authorities, starting with the removal of an undisclosed number of Russian banks from the SWIFT system. First, we commit to ensuring that a certain number of Russian banks are removed from SWIFT.���It will stop them from operating worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports. In addition to cutting off Russia from SWIFT, the European Commission will ���paralyze the assets of Russia���s central bank,��� creating another financial barrier for the Central Bank of Russia to liquidate assets. As for the third measure, European Commission stated: The European Commission will soon launch a transatlantic task force to ensure the effective implementation of all the sanctions, which primarily aim to freeze the overseas assets of Russian officials, elites and their family members. As a fifth measure, the Commission plans to increase coordination against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare. As nations around the globe continue to impose new financial restrictions on Russia, Cointelegraph highlighted on Thursday that Russian billionaires could potentially circumvent any sanctions put forth by world leaders by using cryptocurrencies. One thing to listen for this afternoon is whether these sanctions will include barring Russia from the SWIFT messaging system, which would cut it off from almost all international financial transactions.(Except crypto.) https://t.co/x952GNxbah Now that Russian banks risk being barred from SWIFT���s international financial network, crypto may be the key for rich individuals to evade sanctions. Quantum Economics founder and CEO Mati Greenspan said:	1
Researchers have published a report on two hardware bugs that allow programs to steal sensitive data on affected devices, which is ���most��� devices worldwide. For crypto users, these bugs are a direct threat to the security of their private keys, making the need for secure hardware storage of crypto funds even more pressing. The two bugs, known as Meltdown and Spectre, exploit security vulnerabilities in Intel, AMD, and ARM processors in any device, including PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Meltdown affects all devices with Intel chips, which are estimated to be in 90% of all computers (desktop and laptop combined), the BBC reported. Spectre potentially has an even wider reach, affecting Intel, ARM, and AMD chips in any kind of device. Meltdown and Spectre also work in the cloud. The BBC also reported that the tech industry kept the threat a secret for up to six months via non-disclosure agreements, but now fears are mounting that public awareness could lead to real-life exploits. Bitcoin core developer Jonas Schnelli referred to the newly reported security flaws in terms of how they affect Bitcoin users, laying out three steps to secure cryptocurrency holdings: The current privileged memory side channel attacks just confirms what many Bitcoin users already "know" (feel):   * Don't trust your PC.  * Don't think applications (and private keys) are shielded  * Use a hardware wallet   Background:https://t.co/0avUWC44oyhttps://t.co/pw0cLDWyZe Pavol Rusnak, the CTO of TREZOR manufacturer SatoshiLabs, tweeted Jan. 4 to confirm that its devices are unaffected by Meltdown and Spectre, noting: ���Using a (hardware) wallet is now more important than ever.��� As more people are asking: @TREZOR is not vulnerable to recent Meltdown and Spectre hardware attacks, because it has processor not affected by these. Also our firmware is always signed, so the device never runs untrusted code. Using a hw wallet is now more important than ever! In October 2017, the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet was number eight in the list of top ten best selling items on Amazon���s Computers and Accessories section. Today, Jan.4, the Ledger Nano S is number one.	0
Swiss-Based Bitcoin Wallet Xapo CEO Wences Casares has made one of the most bullish Bitcoin price predictions yet at the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. In comments at the event, Casares forecast one Bitcoin being worth a massive $1 mln in ten years��� time, taking attendees by surprise. Whoa. PayPal guy & @xapo @wences : only buy the #bitcoin you can afford... and predicts it will hit $1 million in 5-10 yrs #consensus2017 Bitcoin price predictions have been increasingly daring in recent months as Bitcoin breaks through one barrier after another - $1,200, $1,600, $1,800 and most recently $2,000. In April, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith joined Snapchat investor Jeremy Liew in saying $500,000 would be the cost per coin by 2030. At the time, Bitcoin cost around $1,170 - around half its current price. "We believe Bitcoin awareness, high liquidity, ease of transport and continued market outperformance as geopolitical risks mount will make Bitcoin a strong contender for investment at a consumer and investor level," the pair told Business Insider. In the intervening month, market outperformance has been the topic on the lips of many. ���Bitcoin 75,300% gain since 2011   ���Ethereum 7,328% gain since January 27th, 2016   ���American Financial Indexes, Trumped The media is also awash with Bitcoin admiration, CNBC calling it the ���new gold��� and running dedicated features on the virtual currency highlighting investment gains.	2
The Kraken cryptocurrency exchange has come back online today, Jan. 13 at 11:30 UTC, after a more than 48-hour delay. The exchange was scheduled to go offline on Jan. 11 at 5 UTC for a predicted two hours for a system upgrade. As the maintenance time offline grew to more than two days, Kraken only sporadically updated their status page with promises of progress and an explanation of a bug found in the production environment. Kraken users had already been unhappy with the crypto exchange before the upgrade delay, citing difficulties placing exchanges and frequent connection errors on the site. The highlight or lowlight of the time offline was Kraken���s update on Jan. 12, 3:46 UTC that they had sent their engineers home to rest rather than launching immediately. The update reads: ���We are close but rather than launch immediately ahead of the team passing out; we will push off a bit to get some rest and be able to better monitor systems and react to problems following launch. Unfortunately, this means several more hours of delay.��� With their return online, Kraken announced that unleveraged trading is free until the end of the month on both their Twitter and their site. The site has been functioning normally since going online, but trading was paused for several hours due to problems displaying order book data that have since been resolved. Earlier this year, crypto exchange Coinbase also went offline for several hours in May due to a reported degraded performance. Additionally, several other exchanges including Luno, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp experienced delays or went offline for maintenance in December after an influx of new cryptocurrency users inspired by the rising price of Bitcoin (BTC) exponentially increased the volume of traffic. Kraken has not yet responded to Cointelegraph���s Jan. 12 request for commentary by press time.	2
The rise in Bitcoin price has been paralleled by a huge increase in demand which has effectively wrecked the Bitcoin trading infrastructure, according to a number of sources. Exchanges like Coinbase have experienced huge slowing, LocalBitcoins has stopped accepting new customer applications, and unconfirmed transactions have skyrocketed. The price point hit peaks over $18,000, though has since scaled back. Nevertheless, demand continued to increase among exchanges. Coinbase was recently tagged as the #1 most popular app on the iTunes store, per Twitter: Coinbase is the #1 app in the App Store! #bitcoin #Appstore pic.twitter.com/u7WyCiU5Z0 Nevertheless, while demand was increasing, the power to control the exchange and provide service was slowing. In fact, so many users met with difficulty that it was covered on mainstream media. And the Coinbase Twitter account was awash with tweets of error pages. But Coinbase wasn���t the only victim. Others fell apart as well. LocalBitcoins even went so far as to stop accepting new clients completely. In a post on the site���s Twitter feed, they made it clear that they were unable to service current clients and could no longer accept new ones. New account registrations are disabled until Dec. 8th 15:00 CET to improve service quality & site responsiveness for existing customers. We appologize for the inconvenience! #Bitcoin #LocalBitcoins And it wasn���t just these two sites. All across the Bitcoin landscape, transactions were slow and users were frustrated as the network experienced some of the highest trading volumes of all time. In fact, nearly 300,000 transactions were pending at one point. The Litecoin Foundation was quick to point this out: There are 223K unconfirmed bitcoin transactions right now.. use Litecoin! pic.twitter.com/ESn3eZYoBn As adoption increases, the need for scaling to meet the massive growth in demand will only increase. The massive surge in the marketplace certainly means that response times are slow but should provide encouragement to those who are holding existing stock of Bitcoin that the bull will continue to run. Dominik Schiener, co-founder at IOTA said: "The fact that exchanges are still struggling with scalability issues after years of development and investments into their infrastructure is a clear indication that the demand for cryptocurrencies is increasing exponentially, unexpectedly so for everyone. It is quite unfortunate that the first experience when entering the realm of cryptocurrencies is filled with frustration of congested networks and exchanges with continuous downtime, but this community still has a whole lot of growing up to do before we're ready for mainstream adoption.��� After publishing, Localbitcoins announced that they had restored the registration of new clients to their site. Nevertheless, with the additional pressure of the large demand, the site remains slow. Their Twitter feed included the following: Account registration is enabled again. We are still experiencing an exceptional load on our servers and you may notice the website being slower than usual. We apologise for the problems! #Bitcoin #LocalBitcoins	2
Independent financial consulting company deVere Group, which provides investment and wealth management services, has predicted that the price of Ethereum (ETH) could hit $2,500 by the end of the year, MarketWatch reported April 27. The financial consultancy firm said that the second largest cryptocurrency could see a significant rise, predicting its fourfold increase thanks to growing adoption of the digital currency as well as the use of smart contracts. Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, told MarketWatch: ���The price of Ethereum is predicted to increase significantly this year, and could hit $2,500 by the end of 2018 with a further increase by 2019 and 2020 [...] This general upswing will be fueled by three mains drivers. First, more and more platforms are using Ethereum as a means of trading. Second, the increased use of smart contracts by Ethereum. And third, the decentralization of cloud computing.��� Green also said that the introduction of cryptocurrency market regulation is only a matter of time. According to Green, this will result in more confidence in the market and better investor protection. At press time, Ethereum is trading at $653.66, with a market cap of $64.7 bln. Following the record-breaking rally of Bitcoin last December, Green predicted that, ���We should expect to see Bitcoin see-sawing in coming weeks. Sharp moves are likely, followed by subsequent corrections.��� Earlier this month, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, known for his optimistic Bitcoin predictions, repeated his bullish forecasts for the leading cryptocurrency price, telling CNBC that it could reach $25,000 by the end of the year.	2
The recent SEC ruling that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) will have to comply with securities registration laws (if the tokens they are selling are considered equity) has resulted in apprehensions that ICOs may dry up in the US. However, Filecoin has raised $52 mln in a pre-ICO sale, as a prelude to what is claimed to be a SEC compliant ICO. Filecoin, developed by Protocol Labs, is a decentralized storage network. The network is expected to give owners of unused storage a means to monetize their storage capacity. It is also expected to bring down the costs of storing data reliably. Given the large amounts of unused storage in data centers and hard drives around the world, a natural market exists for this service. Filecoin has raised $52 mln in a pre-ICO sale, in which the company offered selected investors securities which would lead to the allocation of Filecoin tokens. Investors who took part in the pre-ICO sale include Winklevoss Capital and Digital Currency Group. This will be followed by an ICO on Coinlist, which will open on Aug. 7. The list of documents available for prospective inspectors is comprehensive ��� ranging from the white paper to Private Placement Memorandum to Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT). The tokens will not be registered under the Securities Laws and will be sold under an exemption clause only to accredited investors. Each investor will have to execute the SAFT and will have to complete an investor questionnaire to participate in the token sale. There are also constraints on the ability of investors to sell these tokens until they are ���vested��� (Vesting Period as agreed in the SAFT and measured from the network launch). The SEC rule on accredited investors works on the assumption that wealthy investors (as defined by net worth) are more likely to be knowledgeable and understand the risks of investment. However, in the cryptocurrency space, this is not necessarily true. A cross section of people including students, software engineers, cryptography specialists, etc. may have a deep understanding about ICOs but may not have the net worth required to be an accredited investor. Preventing them from investing is only going to shut out a huge section of the cryptocurrency community from the ICO market.	0
Whales can be bashful and clever creatures, but when you manage to catch one in action it���s a sight to behold ��� consider, for instance, the single entity responsible for depositing 100k ETH into the Eth 2.0 deposit contract from 133 different addresses last week. Deposits into the ETH 2.0 staking contract have been picking up as of late, with 100k ETH pouring into the Eth 2 deposit contract on a single day last week. It caught the attention of the crypto space and, like most stories about on-chain activity, looking at the actual transactions and associated accounts can shed light on what went down. In this case, it seems the 100k ETH influx can be traced back to a single Ethereum address and a wallet that is responsible for funnelling upwards of 258k ETH ($541.8 million at 2100 per ETH) into the deposit contract. Given the relatively steady increase the deposit contract has seen since launching in December, it is likely a single entity was behind last week's unexpected surge. But can we prove it? Can it be reasonably shown that a single entity was behind the 100k ETH worth of deposits? Unfortunately, actually finding the transactions and addresses on-chain was not a quick "first page of Etherscan" find. In hopes of getting a quick win, the first place we checked was the largest total deposits made by a single address to the deposit contact. While this strategy did find one address that had recently deposited some 12,800 ETH across 400 transactions to the deposit contract, unfortunately, it was not the address of interest, as the date of the transactions (June 20, 2021) is a couple days too early and the amount is only ~13% of the total 100k ETH, even though ���only ~13%��� in this case is still over $26.8 million (at $2100 per ETH). It is clear that if the 100k ETH had come from a single entity, they were more discreet than a straight 100k YOLO deposit from one address. A deeper analysis was required, so we downloaded the transactions to the deposit contract from Etherscan for June 22, 2021 and uploaded them into Excel. The data was clear.  From the data pulled for June 22, 2021, there were 1163 addresses that deposited a total of 32 ETH into the deposit contract, 133 addresses that deposited 800 ETH into the deposit contract, and 11 other addresses that deposited other various multiples of 32 ETH. For those unfamiliar, ETH 2.0 is the protocol change Ethereum has been planning since launch that will transition Ethereum from a proof of work to a proof of stake network. Proof of stake validators will secure the network and receive ETH for doing so. One validator starts off as 32 ETH and is currently acquired by sending 32 ETH to a deposit contract on Ethereum mainnet, the current proof of work chain. Depositing is a one way bridge since the full amount of ETH including any interest earned is not accessible until the network merge, which is currently unlikely to happen until late 2022. With the same total deposit amount of 800 ETH on the same day from 133 addresses, our confidence grew that the 100k ETH had in fact come from a single address. To confirm this, there had to be some similarity between the addresses. Sure enough, a quick look revealed that each address was funded by a common address. Eureka! A whale sighting. The picture of our whale was starting to become more clear. Let's take a high level look at how they executed their operation: Looking at the address that was funded with the 100k ETH, they have seen over 258k ETH ($541.8 million at 2100 per ETH) flow through it according to Nansen. Without clicking through to every address, it appears that all of the ETH flowing through this address has been funnelled into the deposit contract in a similar manner to what is described above - starting with a 90,000 ETH transaction on May 21st and a 49,990 ETH transaction on June 14th.  The address is also showing no signs of slowing down. While writing this piece, the address was funded twice more for 6119 ETH and 792 ETH. Based on their seeming Michael Saylor ���sell the office furniture��� mentality, this is almost surely destined for the deposit contract. Looking at the 100k ETH transaction, it was funded from an OG Ethereum address who had immediately received the funds before that from an address that Nansen shows as having received 100% of its 302k ETH from a wallet Nansen has tagged as crypto-lender Celsius.  The OG address in question has transactions going back to September 2016 and looking at their early ERC-20 transactions is a trip down r/ethtrader memory lane including SPANK, KIN, FUN, OMG (airdropped - still haven���t sold ��������) and lots of SAI. They also receive regular deposits of BOND from a contract that Nansen has labeled as vesting indicating they are an early team member or investor. Their total activity according to Nansen is massive, seeing 1.72 million ETH flow in and out. There are only so many OGs with this kind of cash and conviction in Ethereum, and it doesn���t look like they���re going anywhere anytime soon.  The author of this article is 0xBilll.	1
The Japanese Bank Consortium will release an instant domestic payments mobile app, ���MoneyTap,��� using Ripple���s technology in the fall of 2018, Ripple���s blog reported yesterday, March 6. The 61-bank consortium, led by SBI Ripple Asia, is representative of more than 80 percent of all of Japan���s banking assets, according to Ripple. Takashi Okita, CEO of SBI Ripple Asia, said in Ripple���s blog post: ���Together with the trust, reliability and reach of the bank consortium, we can remove friction from payments and create a faster, safer, and more efficient domestic payments experience for our customers.��� Three of the banks in the consortium, SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank, will begin using the app this coming fall, while the rest of the banks will join in gradually. MoneyTap will allow users to make purchases 24 hours a day, every day of the week. Ripple has long focused on building relationships with banks to use its payment technologies. In February, Ripple announced two new financial service partnerships; one with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority for use of its cross-border payment technology for banks within the country and another with Western Union, who is testing Ripple���s Blockchain-based settlement system for transactions. This month, a South Korean bank also announced that it planned on using Ripple���s cross-border payment technologies for remittances, prompted by a Japanese-based test of Blockchain-based remittances involving Ripple and SBI Group.	2
The Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury (FSTB) released a report yesterday, April 30, on the status of money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF). The report concluded that virtual currencies (VC), like Bitcoin (BTC), are not particularly involved in either type of financial crime. The FSTB notes that ���although there is inherent ML/TF vulnerability related to VCs���: ���There does not seem to be any visible impact affecting the overall risk in Hong Kong so far. The risk of VCs is assessed as medium-low.��� The report does mention the use of cryptocurrencies in Ponzi schemes and cybercrimes ��� specifically mentioning the WannaCry attack ��� citing 167 Bitcoin (BTC) related police reports from 2013-2017. The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report also mentions that the FSTB, Hong Kong financial regulators, and law enforcement agencies are working together to look into risks associated with Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and cryptocurrencies in general as well: ���While we have not found substantial risks in these newly developing payment methods or commodities, this is a rapidly developing area requiring continued monitoring.��� According to the report, cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in Hong Kong. The FTSB suggests that because Hong Kong ���is one of the world���s freest economies with a vibrant foreign currency exchange market and no capital controls [...] VCs are therefore not as attractive as in economies where people may try to circumvent currency controls or seek refuge from a high inflation rate���: ���The exchange of Bitcoin in person is not popular [...] Domestically, the use of Bitcoin remains at a negligible level.��� The report writes that the Bitcoin ATMs in Hong Kong are also ���not popularly used by people in Hong Kong.��� As a comparison, in Venezuela ��� a country whose economy is currently experiencing hyperinflation ��� many citizens have begun to rely on Bitcoin as a more stable store of value as compared to their national currency. In February of this year, Hong Kong���s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) warned potential crypto investors that they would keep ���policing��� cryptocurrency and ICO markets. In mid-March, the SFC halted an ICO in Hong Kong and made the company return the money raised, on the grounds that it was an unregistered investment scheme. More recently, in mid-April, the SFC said that the type of fundraising done through ICOs is better suited to venture capital funds.	2
Bill Gates, principal founder of the Microsoft Corporation, has caused a furor among Reddit users, stating that cryptocurrencies are ���a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way���, during an ���Ask Me Anything��� session on Reddit on Feb. 27. Gates wrote: ���The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Government���s ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.��� While drug purchases online have been increasing, the vast majority of drug users still purchase illicit substances via more ���traditional��� methods. According to a 2017 Global Drug Survey, regardless of country, less than half of drug users purchase substances via the dark web in any one country. The global median for percentage of drug users who use the dark net is 10.1 percent.  Gates��� remarks resulted in harsh criticism from Redditors participating in the discussion. While some advised Gates to re-read the Bitcoin white paper, others reproached him for what was perceived to be an attempt to influence the cryptomarket with his celebrity status: ���... [I]f Bill Gates says he doesn���t like crypto because of how well shaded the flow of money is...a lot of ears are perking up,��� said a user calling themself Hoticewater. When one of the users pointed out that fiat currencies can also be used for illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, terrorist funding, and drug purchases, Gates said that the necessity of a physical presence makes illicit activities and transfers more difficult: ���Yes - anonymous cash is used for these kinds of things but you have to be physically present to transfer it which makes things like kidnapping payments more difficult.��� Back in 2015, the Microsoft founder���s position towards cryptocurrencies was far more optimistic. In an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg TV���s Smart Street show, Gates put it baldly that, ���bitcoin is better than currency...���. Moreover, as part of the "Financial Services for the Poor" initiative, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has sponsored the development of Blockchain infrastructure for merchants in Kenya to accept cryptocurrencies. While Gates remains skeptical of cryptocurrencies, the underlying blockchain technology also remains an area of interest of the Microsoft Corporation, which has gone ahead without his direction as CEO. Over the past year, Microsoft participated in several business initiatives related to blockchain technology, like Microsoft Azure or Coco Framework. The company recently announced it was looking to integrate Blockchain-based decentralized IDs into its Microsoft Authenticator app. Microsoft decided that Blockchain technology and protocols were well suited to the task of their project; creating a secure and decentralized form of digital identity.	0
The new Galaxy S10 series smartphones by South Korean tech giant Samsung will apparently have wallet functions for Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and two other tokens. A Samsung official spoke about the phone���s new features at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain on Feb. 25. In its presentation, Samsung revealed various crypto and blockchain related projects featured on the smartphone, including support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, COSMEE token (COSM) and Enjin���s token (ENJ). COSMEE is a blockchain-enabled mobile beauty decentralized app (DApp) where users can earn and spend COSM tokens. Enjin is a cryptocurrency wallet which will reportedly be installed in the new Galaxy S10. COSMEE claims to have been selected by Samsung as the first partner DApp supported by its upcoming smartphone, while Enji can reportedly be used to send and receive ERC-20 tokens and ERC-1155 crypto game assets. Varying reports have surfaced regarding blockchain and crypto integration in Samsung���s new phones. In December 2018, Samsung dismissed the idea of an integrated crypto wallet as ���rumour and speculation.��� In January, leaked photographs of the new smartphone suggested that the Galaxy S10 would support an Ethereum wallet. Earlier today, blockchain-centric smartphone Exodus, developed by consumer electronics giant HTC, announced that it has partnered with Opera Browser and added support for multiple DApps. The company announced support for Etheremon and Decentraland DApps, and the smartphone now reportedly supports a Taiwanese DApp called Numbers.	2
Bank of America (BoA) has admitted to US regulators it may be ���unable��� to compete with the growing use of cryptocurrency. In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week, filed Feb. 22, the major US bank for the first time highlights cryptocurrency as an area that may cause it ���substantial expenditure��� as it tries to remain competitive. ���Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our business,��� BoA states in the filing. As banks worldwide eye the cryptocurrency phenomenon, direct interaction remains low. The lack of uptake formed a central reason why the European Central Bank confirmed it had opted for a hands-off approach to legislating the area earlier this month. While BoA has sought to innovate in the sphere, receiving a patent for its proposed cryptocurrency exchange system in December 2017, it has come in for criticism more recently after blocking its clients from credit card purchases of cryptocurrency. As the report to the SEC continues, the institution���s keen awareness of the threat posed to its core business offering by competitors becomes clear. ���...The competitive landscape may be impacted by the growth of non-depository institutions that offer products that were traditionally banking products as well as new innovative products,��� BoA forecasts. The report continues: ���This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services[.]��� The bank also pointed to staff retention failures and ���increasing competition��� in the financial services industry as being detrimental to its prospects.	0
Tokenized cats have once again caused chaos on the Ethereum network after a nonfungible token (NFT) project from actress Mila Kunis sold out in 35 minutes.  It echoes the launch of another cat-based NFT project, CryptoKitties, which infamously gummed up the Ethereum network in 2017.  The launch of Stoner Cats was initially delayed by a day after the team found a bug in the underlying art layers. However, the second attempt was successful and sold out in just ���35 meow-nutes,��� according to a catastrophic pun from Stoner Cats.  We SOLD OUT in 35 meow-nutes! If you got a TOKEn, drop it here! Gas prices soared as NFT collectors snapped up the first tranche of Stoner Cats, which had a cap of 10,420 NFTs at a price of 0.35 Ether (ETH) each, worth roughly $804 at the time of writing. According to the project���s website, another 3,000 new NFTs will be released over the course of the first season.  Decentralized finance analytics firm Defiprime joked that ���as usual cats clogged Ethereum��� on Twitter, and it shared on-chain data that showed a sharp spike in ETH gas fees ranging between 200 Gwei ($9.50) for a slow transaction and a hefty 709 Gwei ($33.67) for a rapid transaction. $700k lost in Cats' failed TXs https://t.co/RczxG4xeAh According to data from Dune Analytics, there was also a total of 344.4 ETH ($793,000) in value lost to failed Stoner Cats transactions.  Stoner Cats is an animated series that is backed by NFTs, and the characters are voiced by celebrities including Kunis, Jane Fonda, Ashton Kutcher, Seth MacFarlane and Chris Rock. The NFTs grant the owner access to watch the show, and the project uses NFT sales to finance its production.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is also a voice actor for the character dubbed ���Lord Catsinton,��� who is described as a ���spirit guide.���  lmao someone just paid 5.8 ETH (and used up 20% of a block in gas) for a failed tx trying to mint 20 stoner cats https://t.co/JfvRtiGkm9 Investors have now flocked to list the NFTs on OpenSea, and a StonerCat NFT depicting Buterin���s character is currently on sale for 77 ETH worth roughly $177,000 ��� a percentage markup of around 9,500%. An NFT depicting MacFarlane���s character is on sale for 420 ETH, or more than $960,000.  The short-lived surge pales in comparison to CryptoKitties, however, which famously ���broke Ethereum��� back in 2017 after its launch was met with overwhelming demand.  Cointelegraph reported in May 2020 that a surprise CrypoKitties drop overwhelmed the Nifty NFT marketplace after an abundance of collectors flocked to the platform, which resulted in a series of service issues, such as slowness and failed transactions.	1
A US government institute has claimed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the ���original��� Bitcoin while Bitcoin itself (BTC) is a ���fork��� in a surprising official research into cryptocurrency. In a document titled ���Blockchain Technology Overview��� from the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the US Department of Commerce, authors Dylan Yaga, Peter Mell, Nik Roby and Karen Scarfone claim that ���technically,��� the perception that BTC is the genuine version of Bitcoin is incorrect. ���When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC),��� they write. ���Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.��� The document makes for curious reading at a time when the cryptocurrency industry remains awash with propaganda and marketing activities from BCH and BTC representatives alike. Confusion for new users in Bitcoin has increased following July���s hard fork due to some major resources in the industry, notably Roger Ver���s Bitcoin.com, controversially allying with BCH. More recently, two scandals involving BCH, mainstream news outlet CNBC and major US exchange Coinbase further dented BCH���s reputation. The US government document nonetheless appears unfazed by both the events and the nature of Bitcoin���s hard fork itself, continuing on to provide descriptions of other cryptocurrencies. Litecoin, authors say, is a ���complement to Bitcoin,��� while Ethereum Classic is underlined as the original version of ���more popular��� Ethereum. Last Week, ratings agency Weiss also caused a stir when it delivered its first cryptocurrency ratings, giving Bitcoin a ���C+��� and Ethereum a ���B.���	0
An anonymous crypto user has just moved 69,370 Bitcoin from an address associated with the Silk Road darknet market that more recently has become a popular hacking target.  According to a Nov. 3 report from crypto intelligence firm CipherTrace, the recent movement involving two transactions adding up to 69,370 Bitcoin (BTC) ��� or more than $960 million at the time of publication ��� originated from an address connected with the Silk Road marketplace shut down in 2013. The crypto user first sent 1 BTC ��� likely as a test transaction ��� before moving the bulk of the coins.  CipherTrace speculated the anonymous user made the transactions ���to stay up to date with the Bitcoin network��� by switching between address formats. As the last time anyone moved funds associated with the defunct darknet market was in April 2015, the BTC wallet would reportedly also have access to all Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) associated with the tokens��� hard forks. However, the firm didn���t rule out hacking as a possibility: The Silk Road funds were contained in a wallet that has been circulating among hackers for more than two years. In September, a Twitter user claiming to have the wallet.dat file for the wallet put out a call to the crypto community for solutions on how to gain access to the 69,370 coins, even suggesting a quantum computer as a potential way to determine the private keys.  Silk Road was a darknet market that let users buy and sell illicit goods such as weapons and stolen credit card information, but the majority of listings were for illegal drugs. Ross Ulbricht, the site���s founder, is currently serving two life sentences without the possibility of parole after being found guilty of money laundering, computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. He still provides periodic analyses on the Bitcoin market from prison.	0
Livecoin, a lesser-known Russian cryptocurrency exchange, has abruptly halted operations in the aftermath of an alleged hacker attack on Christmas day. According to Livecoin���s main page, the exchange has suffered a ���carefully planned attack��� causing the platform to lose control of all of its servers, backend and nodes. The exchange urged its customers to stop using its services including deposits, trading and API. ���We were not able to stop our service in time. Our news channels were compromised as well. At the moment, we partially control frontend, and so we���re able to place this announcement," Livecoin���s main page reads. Livecoin said that it���s working hard to retrieve control of its servers, promising to provide a security update ���in the next few days.��� The exchange also claimed that it is cooperating with ���local police authorities.��� According to some reports, the incident took place on the night between Dec. 23 and Dec. 24. Hackers have apparently managed to take over Livecoin���s infrastructure and modify the prices on the exchange to abnormally high values. A co-founder of YellowBlock, a crypto educational website, known as "Cryptorangutang" said that Bitcoin (BTC) exceeded $320,000 per coin on the platform on Dec. 24. ���Whatever is going on, I don���t recommend trying to make $ on this, very likely you will get your funds stuck,��� he wrote on Twitter. According to comments of exchange users on Livecoin���s unofficial Telegram group, the exchange is not operating at the time of publishing despite the exchange having briefly opened a login page. Some Reddit users also suggested that Livecoin's "hack" could be a classic exit scam. Livecoin did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph���s request for comment. The exchange is apparently not actively running any official social media accounts on Twitter or Telegram. At the time of publishing, Livecoin���s trading volumes are not available on major crypto tracking websites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. As of Dec. 24, Livecoin was reportedly ranked 173 among crypto exchanges, with a daily trading volume of around $16 million.	0
The rarest Pepe of them all, ���Homer Pepe���, has sold for 205 ETH ($320,000) according to owner Peter Kell. The one-of-a-kind card displays a morph between Simpsons character Homer and the infamous Pepe The Frog.  Pepe is a cartoon frog created by artist Matt Furie and has inspired countless memes on the internet including Rare Pepes, one of the first art experiments on blockchain. The Homer Pepe is a user-generated card from the Rare Pepe collectibles platform developed by Joe Looney in 2016 and showcased in the Rare Art Labs Digital Art Festival in 2018. The card was acquired by Kell at the first-ever live auction for blockchain art for $38,500 ��� said to be the highest price for a non-fungible token, or NFT, at the time. The artwork was also recently featured in the Sundance Film Festival award-winning documentary, "Feels Good Man." The documentary���s official Twitter account said the card sold for more than the cost to make the entire film. The new owner, TokenAngels, appears to be accumulating hundreds of other NFTs in the series, and rushed to pick up the most prized one after news emerged it was up for grabs.  ���I had to sell a few punks in a hurry,��� TokenAngels explained referring to collectibles CryptoPunks. ���It was for far less than they���re worth but it was so important to get the funds together to make the transaction on time!���. Joe Looney acted as escrow for the sale. Well-known artist Matt Kane, honored in Cointelegraph���s Top 100 this year, had earlier created a tribute artwork to Homer Pepe and his tweet about it drew attention to the fact that Kell was looking to sell the original. Auction closes March 11th. My 33rd 1/1 #NFT minted with gratitude to every generation of #cryptoart, old������ & new on @SuperRare this morning. Please check out the 24K zoom & details on my NFT Portal website. I'll enjoy sharing more in the coming days. https://t.co/tAu99DEHvQ pic.twitter.com/z71L0F9hN4 Kane said: "I see HOMERPEPE as the most important NFT in art history because its headline-making sale in 2018 influenced so many of the original crypto artists to believe we could put our art to work building both a market and belief around this new technology."  NFTs, in general, have seen explosive growth this year with more than $300M in sales being generated in the first two months. OpenSea co-founder and chief technology officer Alex Atallah stated earlier this week that the market has grown by more than 7,000% from last year: ���After @3LAU's drop last night, the February Ethereum NFT market passed $300m. That's 7450% growth from last year,��� he said on Mar.1. Renowned music artist 3LAU made history by partnering with Origin Protocol to release his new album through an NFT auction to the top 33 bidders. Raising more than $11.6 million with the top bidder offering $3,666,666. 3LAU also promised to collaborate with the top six bidders to create a custom song or remix for each individual. Beeple hit the news last week with his Crossroads NFT reselling on the secondary market for $6.6 million. He has also broken through into the mainstream art sector with his ���EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS��� NFT currently being auctioned off at Christie���s auction house. Bids for the piece are currently sitting at $3.25 million. Painter Trevor Jones showed the power of the NFT market with his ���Bitcoin Angel��� painting raising more than $3.2 million with 4,157 editions sold in seven minutes.	2
Despite not yet having functional smart contracts on the layer-one, intrepid Cardano developers have recently hacked together methods to mint bootleg nonfungible tokens. These experiments in hosting unique data on the blockchain are reminiscent of the pre ERC-721 standard era for Ethereum ��� and, what���s more, so far they���ve proven to be enormously popular with token drops routinely selling out.  In a post on Reddit today, ADA Technology Management (ATM), a staking pool operator for Cardano, revealed what they claimed to be two NFT images they���d minted on the chain. In the thread the company said they were planning to offer NFT minting as a service to pool delegators. The so-called NFTs come with a number of caveats, however. Because Cardano doesn���t yet support smart contracts or have a NFT token standard, in order to create a NFT users mint a native token one-of-one native token.  ���Tokens on Cardano are native and are on the same level as ADA. Instead of smart contracts, so called "minting policies" control the flow of a certain token group. NFTs are basically tokens on Cardano with a quantity of 1,��� explained Alessandro, the self-described ���brains��� behind SpaceBudz, a Cardano-native collectibles project and the author of a Cardano Improvement Proposal to establish a Cardano NFT metadata standard. @spacebudzNFT sales are starting to get a little bit crazy Big shoutout to @StaleDev for making this bot! pic.twitter.com/UW7iwCUL6J Developers can then embed in the token metadata a link to an Arweave and/or InterPlanetary File System address where an image is stored. One example NFT shows that the ���metadata��� section of a mint transaction includes a link to a IPFS address which displays the associated SpaceBud. The end result is a wholly unique token permanently recorded and transferrable on the Cardano blockchain ��� a NFT by many, if not all, definitions.  Despite the extra hoops developers have to jump through to create them, the NFTs have proven to be enormously popular with users.  According to Alessandro, SpaceBudz sold out all 10,000 NFTs in just three days at a price of 50 ADA per, and there���s already an eager secondary market where especially rare SpaceBudz have sold for as high as $40,000.  Even before SpaceBudz, CardanoKidz was working on Cardano-native NFTs as early as August 2020. Multiple pre-sale rounds sold out ���within hours of launch,��� according to Zac, a member of the CardanoKidz marketing team. One Satoshi-inspired Kid sold for 32,000 ADA even before the tokens were minted, and the NFTs themselves went live in late March. First Full Colour (FC) 001 minted. @IOHK_Charles pic.twitter.com/FThPDvDNZX Zac credits tools like a community-developed token and minting policy tracker for helping to make developers��� lives easier. The official Cardano developers, IOHK, appear to be embracing the new vertical as well, as lead engineer Polina Vinogravoda gave a quick tutorial on minting NFTs on the chain on Tuesday.  A host of other projects round out the upstart ecosystem, including CryptoPunk-inspired CardanoBits, and minting platform CNFT. While still rudimentary, the NFTs on Cardano are cheaper than those on Ethereum as well: minting a native token costs roughly 2 ADA, or $2.50. While the developers working in this nascent community have managed so far, ultimately they���re excited for smart contracts to make their lives easier. ���We can���t wait for smart contracts to arrive for more functionality but we had JUST enough tools and experience to make NFTs work on Cardano,��� said Zac. ���It���s been an incredible journey so far.���	1
Bitcoin could pass $100,000 by February 2021; a Harvard academic has said announcing Bitcoin is the first digital currency to follow Moore���s Law. In emailed comments to Business Insider, investor Dennis Porto said that after analyzing Bitcoin���s performance, it was the ���first��� currency to follow the digital technology rule. ���Moore's law specifically applied to the number of transistors on a circuit but can be applied to any digital technology," Porto wrote. "Any technology that is growing exponentially (i.e., 'following Moore's law') has a doubling time." The comments come as Bitcoin price hits new all-time highs as SegWit lock-in is set for Aug. 9. The march towards $3,500 per coin mimics the growth rate seen by the handful of altcoins which activated SegWit earlier this year, such as Litecoin. Porto makes the assertion that Bitcoin price has de facto doubled every eight months since its inception. ���This poses a unique opportunity for investors,��� he added, something which was well-received in social media circles. While multiple well-known commentators have contributed their opinions on how much one Bitcoin will cost in the next five or 10 years, $100,000 by 2021 is at the bolder end of the spectrum. This week, Max Keiser repeated his faith in Bitcoin reaching $5,000 in the coming months.	2
Bitcoin is now becoming a constant part of many Venezuelans��� everyday life. Whether they���re buying food, plane tickets, or even paying employees, Bitcoin is now a common mode of payment for Venezuelans. Frankly, many people in the country rely on cryptocurrencies for survival. Venezuela���s hyperinflation has rendered the national currency, the Bolivar, nearly worthless. Thousands of ordinary people have begun turning to the world of cryptocurrency to salvage what little value remains in their savings.. One Venezuelan, John Villar, knows the struggle of having a his national currency become worthless, so he sticks with Bitcoin for all of his transactions. He said that his situation, choosing digital currency is not a matter of politics but of survival. Bitcoin transactions are relatively swift for anyone with a smartphone: Websites like LocalBitcoin and Colibit function as exchanges where Venezuelans can buy and sell bitcoins using a local bank account. Cryptocurrencies have become so fashionable that even President Nicolas Maduro has proposed a government-backed version called the Petro. Members of his administration have met with Venezuelan Bitcoin entrepreneurs to determine how such a currency might work. Though few details have been released, many in the Bitcoin world have responded skeptically to the idea. It seems unlikely that Venezuelans will trust a digital currency issued by a government they have little faith in. In Venezuela, the so-called "crisis currency" is allowing desperate Venezuelans to make potentially life-saving purchases. Villar had been unable to find several of the medications needed to treat his wife's multiple sclerosis in Venezuela for the last two years, a story not uncommon in a country whose public health system has been crippled by shortages. Instead, he purchased them abroad with Bitcoin and used courier services to deliver them to Venezuela. Authorities have largely permitted trading of Bitcoin in Venezuela, though they have heavily fined and detained people who attempt to mine the digital currency. For Villar, the stakes are especially high, and not just for his business. An engineer who once ran a biometrics enterprise, he is staking his financial future on the development of a game involving an alternative cryptocurrency called PepeCash. A dozen employees operate from a small office filled with computers in an industrial community east of the capital. All receive part of their salary in Bitcoin. His wife, also an engineer, is now largely bound to a wheelchair. "At this moment, I don't have a single bolivar." Ambassadors from other digital currency projects, such as Dash, have been trying to familiarize Venezuelans with an array of cryptocurrencies. Earlier this fall, Dash sponsored 12 free conferences in the country in order to raise awareness.	1
Sometimes you have a comeback so good you have to wait until the perfect time to use it. Apparently, for Julian Assange, that time was when Bitcoin hit $5,746.51. The Wikileaks founder posted his comment on Twitter, after a stunning week of price jumps in the cryptocurrency���s value.  The tweet was accompanied by a chart of the value of Bitcoin. My deepest thanks to the US government, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCard, Payal, AmEx, Mooneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010. It caused us to invest in Bitcoin -- with > 50000% return. pic.twitter.com/9i8D69yxLC Wikileaks was forced to invest in Bitcoin in 2010 after the release of sensitive government documents related to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The bipartisan attempt to cut Assange of from funding backfired, as he was forced to accept Bitcoin rather than dollars.Talk about a massive boon for Assange--he���s up 50,000%. Wikileaks has been on the forefront of revealing government corruption, and Assange has lived as a fugitive in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012. With all the antigovernment rhetoric, it���s no wonder Assange is not friendly with pro-government fiat currencies. Wikileaks and its founder represent the sort of non-governmental control that Bitcoin is founded upon.	2
Kodak, a company that seemed dead and gone with the advent of digital photography, just saw a surge today as it announced the creation of its own cryptocurrency. The so-called KodakCoin will be the token that powers the company���s new KodakOne platform. KodakOne will allow photographers to register their images, license them and search the web for unauthorized usage. CEO Jeff Clarke explained: ���For many in the tech industry, ���Blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem.Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that." Kodak���s stock doubled in value following the company���s announcement. Connecting one���s company to Blockchain or cryptocurrency seems to be the latest - and most sure-fire - way of increasing one���s stock value. Long Island Iced Tea company recently changed its name to Long Blockchain and saw its value increase five-fold. While Clarke is optimistic that the new cryptocurrency will revive Kodak���s flagging fortunes, the Financial Times calls the move a ���last desperate bid for relevance.��� KodakCoin will be launched by ICO on January 31. The token sale is only open to accredited investors.	2
Privacy-centric coin Grin received an anonymous 50 Bitcoin (BTC) donation to its General Fund on Nov. 11, sparking a bizarre rumor that the generous soul behind it was Satoshi. The donation, announced the same day by Grin on Twitter, was made via crypto exchange Coinbase by a donor who expressly wished to remain anonymous, according to a Nov. 11 forum post by Grin dev Daniel Lehnberg.  Lehnberg has revealed that he briefly interacted with the donor. While upholding his/her/their desired anonymity, he nonetheless shared some of the donor(s)��� edited remarks, including reported statements such as: ���Our motives are not economical! It���s about the technology and the protocol. Please put it to good use for the development of GRIN. You keep working as you did in the past [...] This is what we are honouring right now with these donations so that you can work freely [...] without economic dependencies.��� Apparently finding the unusual nature of the donation to be not quite enough, some cryptocurrency media outlets responded by confecting the theory that Satoshi Nakomoto ��� Bitcoin���s mysterious inventor(s) ��� was behind the donation.  The theory was fed by an apparent Telegram group chat message from Litecoin (LTC) founder Charlie Lee revealing that the donated coins were mined in 2010, and transferred from a wallet that had been idle for almost 9 years. Lee has since confirmed the message was ���just a joke.��� As previously reported, Grin is a privacy coin that implements scalability- and privacy-focused Mimblewimble protocol  ��� named after a fictional tongue-tying curse from the popular Harry Potter novels. Mimblewimble is in part a variant of the cryptographic protocol known as Confidential Transactions, which allows for transactions to be obfuscated yet verifiable so as to achieve both heightened privacy and the prevention of double-spending. This summer, Grin underwent a hard fork ��� the network���s first since its launch in mid-January of this year ��� to introduce tweaks to its consensus algorithm in order to achieve greater resistance to ASIC miners. This October, the Litecoin Foundation published two new draft improvement proposals designed to work toward establishing privacy features for the network by integrating Mimblewimble.	1
Power Ledger, an Australian renewable energy company expects the Blockchain to improve efficiency in the market by enabling peer to peer trading, to make solar panels cheaper. Now it is seeking support through the pre-sale of POWR tokens.  The ultimate aim of the POWR token is to enable peer to peer energy trading. Blockchain is becoming a hot topic in the power industry today. For example, Austrian and German energy provider Switch has recently begun accepting Bitcoin for gas and electricity bill payments. Excess electricity generated by individuals (say through a solar panel on the rooftop) may be sold to other individuals who need them. By cutting out the middleman in power trading, costs are expected to come down. This may result in more people installing solar power panels and using renewable sources of energy. Ultimately higher demand could result in economies of scale for solar panel manufacturers and costs may come down. A virtuous cycle could be initiated, where lower prices fuel further demand. Unlike other ICOs where the developers have nothing but a white paper backing them and yet manage to raise millions of dollars in a matter of minutes, the ICO of Power Ledger is backed by an established business model. The energy trading platform built by Power Ledger is fully commercially deployed and supported by multiple energy providers (including Vector NZ, Western Power WA). The company will utilize funds raised to continue its expansion into various other markets, including India and other emerging markets. The pre-sale of POWR tokens does not have a minimum subscription size, but has a spending cap of $25K per subscriber. This provision is to ensure that the presale is not dominated by a few whales and enjoys broad-based support. Power Ledger expects this support to give stability to the value of POWR tokens. Multiple tokens have been subject to market manipulation, with whales resorting to pump and dump schemes, leading to small individual investors getting disillusioned. The company is currently selling 100 mln tokens at a fixed price of $ 8.8c in its presale. The company will sell 160 mln POWR tokens in an unrestricted ICO in September, which will determine the final price of POWR tokens. As per a Bloomberg report, the pre-sale was 57 percent subscribed since opening on Sunday. This indicates that subscribers had paid around $5 mln to obtain POWR tokens. If the pre-sale is completed successfully, the company will have raised ~ $9 mln of funds. If the price discovery at the ICO is in line with the fixed price at which the presale tokens were sold ($ 8.8c), the total money raised by the company could be $30 mln. Considering the amount of money raised by other ICOs with only a concept backing them, this should not be a tough call. If demand during the ICO is high, the total money raised by the company could reach $100 mln.	2
Ethereum Classic (ETC) continues to maintain its parabolic price action advance that began in late March. Data from crypto market aggregator CoinGecko shows ETC is up almost 50% in the last 24-hour trading period as of the time of writing. Indeed, the 20th-ranked crypto by market capitalization is currently at an all-time high above $76. The first likely reason for this current price action advance is that it is a continuation of ETC���s positive performance since the end of Q1 2021.  As previously reported by Cointelegraph, major forks such as Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had been seeing significant upward moves. ETC was a consequence of the Ethereum hard fork that ensued after disagreements on the best course of action to rectify the decentralized autonomous organization debacle of July 2016. Retail hype is also building on ETC especially as the token is available to buy on the popular trading app Robinhood. Online search volume for Ethereum Classic is on the high, according to data from Google Trends. This current retail hype may also be attributed to Ether (ETH) smashing its all-time high and moving beyond $3,000 for the first time. Indeed, social media sentiment points to newbie ETC holders considering the ���green Ethereum��� a much cheaper alternative to the ETH juggernaut. ETC has also outperformed ETH in terms of year-to-date price action gains by a factor of over threefold. Robinhood only supports trading of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and...Ethereum ClassicI think I now know where the DOGE money is going next https://t.co/wH72c7Hi6O Retail traders are not the only investors keen on adding to their ETC bags as Grayscale has also been upping its Ethereum Classic ownership. The Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust currently holds about $711.6 million in assets under management. ETC���s positive price performance so far in 2021 also offers some reprieve for a project plagued by security issues in 2020. The green Ethereum suffered multiple 51% attacks with millions of dollars in ETC siphoned from the project. With cryptos such as ETC, BCH and Dogecoin (DOGE) printing significant price gains, the alt season narrative continues to build especially amid Bitcoin���s (BTC) current stutter. The Bitcoin market capitalization dominance is also at its lowest level since July 2018.	1
California resident Seth Shapiro has filed a lawsuit against wireless service giant AT&T alleging that its employees helped to perpetrate a SIM-swap which resulted in the theft of over $1.8 million in total, including cryptocurrencies. The complaint filed on Oct. 17 claims that Shapiro is ���a two-time Emmy Award-winning media and technology expert, author, and adjunct professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts.��� The lawsuit alleges that between May 16 and May 18 AT&T employees transferred access to Shapiro���s mobile phone to outside hackers: ���AT&T employees obtained unauthorized access to Mr. Shapiro���s AT&T wireless account, viewed his confidential and proprietary personal information, and transferred control [...] to a phone controlled by third-party hackers in exchange for money. [...] The hackers then utilized their control over Mr. Shapiro���s AT&T wireless number [...] to access his personal and digital finance accounts and steal more than $1.8 million.��� The document states that these actions allowed the hackers to also access Shapiro���s personal accounts on several cryptocurrency exchanges: "While third parties had control over Mr. Shapiro's AT&T wireless number, they used that control to access and reset the passwords for Mr. Shapiro's accounts on cryptocurrency exchange platforms including KuCoin, Bittrex, Wax, Coinbase, Huobi, Crytopia, LiveCoin, HitBTC, Coss.io, Liqui, and Bitfinex." The plaintiff also claims to be in possession of chat logs in which AT&T employees and hackers discuss how the stolen money should be routed and brag about how much they took. Shapiro also claims that he fell victim to SIM-swapping multiple times, therefore his personal information and online accounts were already leaked in the past. The complaint states: ���AT&T���s Repeated Failures to Protect Mr. Shapiro���s Account from Unauthorized Access Are a Violation of Federal Law.��� More precisely, Shapiro alleges that AT&T is in violation of the Federal Communications Act for failing to protect the confidentiality of his account information.  He also claims that the telecom giant violated several California state���s laws, including the Unfair Competition Law, the Constitutional Right to Privacy and the Consumers Legal Remedy Act. Lastly, Shapiro also accuses AT&T of two acts of negligence. Notably, this is not the first lawsuit against AT&T over SIM-swapping. As Cointelegraph reported on July 27, the federal judge overseeing the Terpin v. AT&T case dismissed the motion. At the time, this was the latest development in a legal battle pertaining to cryptocurrencies stolen via SIM-swapping that has been going on for almost a year.	0
Cute, cuddly kittens are taking over the Ethereum network, and are presently responsible for 4% of the transactions taking place on the so-called ���world computer.��� That���s right, the smart contract platform that could potentially disrupt multiple industries is now playing host to a viral cat game. The game, CryptoKitties, launched just a few days ago on November 28 but is already the second most popular application on the Ethereum network. Unsurprisingly, the premise of CryptoKitties is to acquire an array of different cat cartoons, each having different attributes or ���cattitudes.��� These attributes are coded into a virtual genome, with each cat displaying certain physical features, phenotypes, depending on their genetic code, or genotype. If this sounds a lot like your high school biology class, that���s because it is. Users ���breed��� different kitties together to acquire new cats with different and possibly rare features. There are four billion possible combinations. Just as you can buy swords and armor in online games such as World of Warcraft, rare kitties can be traded for real money, fetching prices as high as $5,000 each. However, unlike virtual items in online games, which are lost if the game shuts down, kitties last forever. That���s because they are actually discrete tokens that exist on the Ethereum network, so even if the game developers disappear, players��� kitties will remain. The game developers insist that it���s impossible for them to game the system. Technical architect Dieter Shirley said: ���The CryptoKitties economy is entirely decentralized and impossible for the development team to manipulate. Anyone on the team with knowledge of the breeding algorithm is prohibited from playing.��� Marketing director Elsa Wilk wrote: ���Our approach to brand and marketing is, in part, a tongue-in-cheek critique of the ICO market today.��� With the red-hot digital currency market generating rapid games and reaching new highs on an almost weekly basis, investors have become frenetic. Speculators search for the hottest ICOs with the intention of selling their tokens quickly for massive profits. With such seriousness abounding in the cryptocurrency market, games like CryptoKitties provide a refreshing note of humor. As Wall Street continues to show great interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Main Street may catch on to digital currency in the most unusual possible way: by playing cat games on the Blockchain.	2
South Korea Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon has reaffirmed that the government will not ban or otherwise ���suppress��� cryptocurrency in the country, according to a statement reported by Reuters today, Jan. 31. In the latest update to the country���s ongoing regulatory overhaul of cryptocurrency exchange, Kim firmly distanced Seoul from previous comments about a potential outright ban, which had caused public outrage earlier this month. ���There is no intention to ban or suppress cryptocurrency (market),��� he said in the statement. Kim and Justice Minister Park Sang-ki caused an uproar earlier this month after the latter said in a press conference that a ban on cryptocurrency exchange was in the works. Mainstream media then published misleading reports that the ban was certain, which helped push a cryptocurrency sell-off. A public petition that called to have both ministers removed from their jobs and to lessen regulation subsequently gathered over 200,000 signatures, which means the government must formally respond to it. Regulatory steps are now a priority for lawmakers, Kim continued, as reports emerge about a customs crackdown on alleged ���illegal��� trading involving cryptocurrencies. Having identified a trade worth almost $600mln, enforcement is now investigating transactions that openly flout fresh anti-anonymous trading laws, which went into effect Tuesday, Jan. 30. ���[The] Customs service has been closely looking at illegal foreign exchange trading using cryptocurrency as part of the government���s task force,��� a statement announced. The anonymous bank accounts ban is already facing its share of problems, as it emerged that the increased workload for banks that the new system demands could make smaller exchanges face anything from existing in a regulatory ���blind spot��� to being forced to cease trading.	2
Sheila Bair, former US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair, told CNBC���s ���Fast Money��� on Friday, Jan. 19 that there is no precedent to ban Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset, but there is a need for additional regulation of digital currencies. Bair had previously written a December 2017 op-ed on Yahoo along the same theme of more regulation without any bans against BTC. In the ���Fast Money��� interview Friday, Bair reiterated that while, ���we don���t ban assets,��� regulating crypto markets is necessary to prevent both money laundering and the potential for market manipulation. Bair looks favorably on CBOE and CME���s recent releases of Bitcoin futures contracts, saying: ���I think that the fact that CME and CBOE launched futures actually could help because that will actually also give them [government regulatory bodies] a window into providing, getting more reporting from the underlying Bitcoin exchanges that are feeding prices into their futures products. It will give the CFDC a window and some information to make sure there���s no manipulation going on.��� Bair���s current main concern with Bitcoin is that the public may be attracted by the promise of high returns and begin investing in Bitcoin and other digital currencies without a clear understanding of what these products are. In regards to the public���s overall understanding of cryptocurrencies, Bair says: ���I think there���s a lot of confusion between Bitcoin and blockchain technology.��� Bair currently serves on the board of Paxos, a fintech company working with Blockchain technology. She noted during the CNBC interview that she does not own Bitcoin.	2
Seeking Alpha analyst Geoffrey Caveney forecasts that the ���silver��� in the world of cryptocurrencies, Litecoin, has the capability to become one of the best investing options in the market. Caveney���s prediction is based on the fact that the digital currency is one of the three virtual currencies that are being supported to be traded on Coinbase, which is arguably the most famous exchange cryptocurrency platform as of August 2017. The other digital currencies are the virtual currency market���s ���gold��� Bitcoin and Ethereum. In his report, Caveney claimed that aside from the support from Coinbase, there are other reasons behind his positive views on Litecoin: ���There are at least a half dozen other digital currencies out there that are about as big and well-known as Litecoin, including several that have larger total market caps at the moment, so it���s a big deal that only Litecoin is supported by Coinbase along with Bitcoin and Ethereum. But Coinbase���s approval is not the only reason to consider buying Litecoin.��� According to Caveney, Litecoin���s adoption and activation of the scaling upgrade soft fork called Segregated Witness (SegWit) has worked wonders on the digital currency���s performance. SegWit was originally designed for the leading virtual currency Bitcoin, but developers of Bitcoin opted to implement the ���hard-fork��� option that was activated on Aug. 1. This has led to the split of the Bitcoin Blockchain network and the creation of the new digital currency called Bitcoin Cash. Moreover, Litecoin developers are also scheduled to add the Lightning Network to the Litecoin platform which is expected to improve the scalability of transactions and to investigate the feasibility of anonymous smart contracts. Litecoin has been trading at the $44.69 level against the dollar and already has a market cap of $2,345 bln.	2
The German Federal Ministry of Finances considers Bitcoin as tax-exempt so long as it is used as a means of payment, Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reported Thursday, March 1. The German federal authority published its decision to not subject purchases with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency to taxes on Feb. 27, citing the European Court���s 2015 decision, which set a precedent for all members of the European Union. The Court justified its taxing decision by stating that it considers cryptocurrency as a legal means of payment: ���So-called virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin) are considered equal to the legal means of payment, as long as these so-called virtual currencies have been accepted as alternative and contractual means of payment by the parties involved in the transaction and have no other purpose than being used as a means of payment.��� According to the decision, a conversion from crypto to fiat or vice versa is classified as ���other taxable services���. Therefore, a party that is acting as an intermediary for this exchange will not be taxed. Under this provision, operators of crypto exchanges can also get tax exemptions, ���if they complete the purchase and sale of Bitcoin as an intermediary on their own behalf.��� The court decision also notes that miner fees will not be taxed, since they are paid on a voluntary basis. These guidelines distinguish Germany from the US where The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats Bitcoin like property, meaning that each purchase using Bitcoin is technically considered to be a sale of property and is, therefore, subject to capital gains tax.	2
The Central Bank of Poland has admitted to funding anti-cryptocurrency campaigns on social media, specifically Polish Youtuber Marcin Dubiel and his Dec. 2017 video, ���I LOST ALL THE MONEY?!,��� Polish news portal money.pl reports. The social media campaign against crypto was carried out by Central Bank of Poland in conjunction with Polish Youtube partner network Gamellon, Google Ireland Limited, and Facebook Ireland Limited, allocating about 91,000 zloty (around $27,000) for producing anti-crypto content. Money.pl reports that the Central Bank���s campaign also had videos published on the Planeta Fakt��w (Planet of Facts) Youtube channel, which has over 1.5 mln subscribers. Dubiel���s Youtube channel has over 900,000 subscribers. Dubiel���s video makes no mention of the paid aspect of the Youtuber���s inspiration. Since Dec. 8, 2017, the Dubiel���s digital story of a young man who invests all his money in crypto only to lose it all has amassed over 500,000 views.   The description of the video contains the hashtag #uwa��ajnakryptowaluty, which is the Polish Financial Supervision Authority and the Central Bank of Poland���s joint website dedicated to warnings against the use of cryptocurrencies. The clip���s dramatic climax takes place in a restaurant when the main character can���t pay for his date���s meal with his new crypto investment, causing her to throw fiat money at him and storm out in a huff. While problems with cryptocurrency-related online advertisements have recently emerged, with China allegedly banning all such ads from social media within the country, anti-crypto ads are more unusual. After officially recognizing both trading and mining of cryptocurrencies in Feb. 2017, Poland seems to have stayed out of the crypto news cycle. However, after Venezuela���s Nicolas Maduro announced the launch of a national cryptocurrency, the petro, Poland is reportedly one of the foreign investors willing to trade food and medicine for the new petro currency. The video ends with the ���evil��� crypto investor that led Dubiel to ruin laughing while counting his fiat riches.	0
The Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH (RBVC) has made a significant investment in IOTA, according to sources close to both companies. This is the first investment in Distributed Ledger Technology for Robert Bosch VC. IOTA, the cryptocurrency for the Internet of Things (IoT), has recently experienced explosive growth. The market cap of the IOTA cryptocurrency (MIOTA) grew 400 percent, reaching #4 among all cryptocurrencies after the company announced the launch of their Data Marketplace in late November. In addition to the investment, RBVC Partner Dr. Hongquan Jiang will join the IOTA Foundation���s advisory board. Of particular interest to the RBVC group is IOTA���s ���tangle��� technology, which is a generalization of Blockchain protocol that lets machines on the IoT communicate and transact.  Speaking about the recent investment, Dr. Jiang stated: ���We have been working with the IOTA team for more than one year. I���m very excited about IOTA���s innovative tangle technology, which could potentially become the standard underlying technology for trustless machine to machine communication, security and payment in the IoT space.���	2
Cryptocurrency markets are on the up today, Jan. 12, with almost all of the top 20 coins on CoinMarketCap in the green, and the highest gain reaching almost 37 percent at press time. The market had been in the red as recently as Jan. 11, with almost $100 bln in losses in total market capitalization over a three day period. The dip on early on Jan. 11 brought the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies down to around $630 bln. Total market cap is now recovering, climbing to around $720 bln at press time.  Ripple (XRP), the second most valuable altcoin on the market, is showing almost 18 percent growth over the past 24 hours to press time. The altcoin saw a price dip yesterday, in part due to false reports that South Korea banned crypto trading in the country, where Ripple is traded at high volumes. Additionally, CoinMarketCap���s Jan. 8 decision to remove several South Korean exchanges from its price calculations -- due to ���divergence in prices��� --  caused the average price of Ripple in particular to appear to drop suddenly. CoinMarketCap���s delayed announcement of the decision also reportedly led to panic-selling that worsened the drop. Since Ripple���s Jan. 11 announcement of their partnership with MoneyGram, a fiat payment transfer service, the coin is showing recovery, trading at an average of $2.07 at press time.  Altcoin Stellar, ranking 8th on CoinMarketCap, is showing 33.34 percent growth over 24 hours, and is selling for about $0.67 at press time. The price spike can likely be attributed to a Jan.11 CNBC segment, where Bitcoin investor Brian Kelly predicted that Stellar is the next coin to buy after Ripple���s Moneygram deal success. Stellar also retweeted the segment in response early morning today, Jan. 12: Enjoy watching while still HOT and not taken down... ?https://t.co/TKk7FbJd6Q   Why #BuyStellar ?   - ���Faster and cheaper than Bitcoin.���  - @moneygram deal  - @IBM deal   Back to over a dollar soon...#stronghands pic.twitter.com/MJtBzUhVNm Altcoin EOS, in the 10th spot on CoinMarketCap, has seen the most significant 24 hour gains of the top 20 coins, boasting almost 37 percent growth. The altcoin���s performance is apparently a response to hype from a Jan. 11 tweet hinting at a secret announcement forthcoming on Jan. 12 from Seoul, South Korea. EOS is currently trading at an average of $14.40. The only two coins in the top 20 that are in the red are ICON, with a loss of 2.93 percent, currently selling at $9.45, and Raiblock, down 4.06 percent and selling for $25.49 at press time. Bitcoin (BTC)  is up a modest 3.53 percent, trading at press time at an average of $14,123.10. The coin remains down from its December $20,000 high, and has been hovering between $14-15k since the Dec. 22 market dip, when BTC slid as low as $12,850.	2
Some Ethereum miners are trying to drum up support for a demonstration of force to show their opposition to the impending implementation of EIP-1559. Amid the backdrop of ever-escalating Ethereum fees, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal seeks to replace the network���s existing bidding-based fee market with a fixed price and burn mechanism.  However, EIP-1559 ��� which is scheduled to go live in July, will significantly impact the revenue of miners. Some analysts estimating Ethereum miners could lose up to 50% of their profits. To signal their opposition to the proposal, some Ether miners are now planning a 51-hour show of force for April 1. Miners intend to direct their hash rate to the 1559-opposed pool, Ethermine, for 51 hours on April 1. Some apparently hope to harness more than 51% of hash rate. For educational purposes, let's collectively move our hash to https://t.co/6osh2Op6yl April 1st for 51 hours. @etherchain_org @BitsBeTrippin @SonOfATech @maxvoltage @SavageMine @VoskCoin @Nemisist2 @notyournormalm1 @BrandonCoin1 @GuntisVitolins #eip1559 #stopeip1559 #Ethereum If that were successful, the pool would command enough mining power to make unilateral changes to the network���s protocol.  In a video streamed live on March 9, popular YouTuber, ���Bits Be Trippin���,��� discussed the planned hash-power redirect, describing the proposed move as a benevolent ���a show of force���: The YouTuber sought to placate concerns that Ethermine could the new-found hash power to attack the network, claiming ���there���s no incentive��� for them to do so. ���What it is showing is that if you have a misalignment of incentives, you can get the network into a position where a would-be attacker could put a price point out there, pay a lot more for that hashpower that just got kicked off, and now you have a situation where you could have a double-spend or a block reorg,��� he said. On March 5, Cointelegraph reported that Ethereum���s core developers announced EIP-1559 would be implemented in July. Many Ethereum proponents from outside of the mining sector celebrated the news. It's happening - EIP-1559 is officially scheduled for July. Thanks everyone who has worked hard to make this happen. https://t.co/kYLEjZiLeD Apart from keeping a lid on fees, part of the appeal of the proposal is that it could end up lowering the Ether supply. Appearing on Tim Ferriss' podcast yesterday, Ethereum co-founder and EIP-1559 co-author, Vitalik Buterin, emphasize the proposal���s burn mechanism could result in more Ether being destroyed than created ��� creating a bullish dynamic for Ethereum: Previous analysis has estimated that more than 1 million Ether would have been burned between October 2019 and October 2020 if EIP-1559 had been live at the time ��� equating to roughly 1% of the crypto asset���s circulating supply.	1
Multi-currency money-sending app Circle has announced today, Feb. 26, that they have acquired major US-based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex for $400 mln, Fortune reports. Earlier this month, Cointelegraph had covered previously unconfirmed rumors that this acquisition was set to soon take place. Goldman Sachs-funded Circle is made up of three parts: Circle Pay for fiat transfers, Circle Trade as a liquidity provider of cryptocurrencies, and the upcoming Circle Invest, an app that will allow retail customers to invest in crypto markets. The Poloniex exchange offers trades in 68 different coins, and is currently the 14th largest crypto exchange by 24-hour volume on CoinMarketCap, trading a total of almost $140 million today to press time. In today���s announcement on the Circle blog, Circle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire wrote that the first step for Circle is to address customer support and the technical side needed to support the Poloniex platform. Secondly, ���We also look forward to scaling Poloniex up and out through market expansion and localization, increasing token listings where possible and appropriate, and exploring the fiat USD, EUR, and GBP connectivity that Circle already brings to its compliant Pay, Trade, and Invest products.��� In the future, Neville and Allaire write that they plan on growing the Poloniex platform into more than a crypto-only exchange, writing that they envision a ���Robust multi-sided distributed marketplace that can host tokens which represent everything of value: physical goods, fundraising and equity, real estate, creative productions such as works of art, music and literature, service leases and time-based rentals, credit, futures, and more.��� Poloniex���s press release echoed Circle���s sentiments, writing that they are looking forward ���To bringing Circle's experience to increase the scalability and reliability of our platform and operations. User experience is paramount. If we aspire to build a token marketplace that will change the fundamentals of global value exchange, we cannot settle for anything less than excellence in our product.���	1
Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver has defended US exchange Coinbase���s alleged insider trading, saying the practice is a ���non-crime��� and should not warrant increased regulation of crypto exchanges. In an interview with CNBC on the topic of Bitcoin Cash, Ver said the ongoing investigation into strange price behavior on Coinbase���s exchange GDAX is not illegal, even if dishonest activity by staff were to be found. ���I think insider trading is a non-crime,��� he told viewers. Ver was specifically responding to a question about whether or not the alleged insider trading is a sign that crypto exchanges need more regulation. Ver stated that more regulation was not necessary and that investors themselves should be wary of any service they use, saying: ���At the end of the day, buyer���s beware of whatever service they���re using whether it���s a Bitcoin exchange, or whether it���s a coffeeshop��� don���t depend on the government to keep you safe from everything out there in the world.��� In defense of the alleged Coinbase insider trading, he added that trading of BCH with insider information prior to the platform���s addition of the currency would have in fact helped tame volatility.  The altcoin hit $9,000 when trading opened on Coinbase���s GDAX on Dec. 19 (current market price is $3,700). Ver���s words offer another perspective amidst increasing rumors of foul play on the part of Coinbase employees. Tone Vays, the analyst who has historically been firmly in support of Bitcoin and critical of Bitcoin Cash, linked to a Reddit thread today in which one user said his ���mate at Coinbase��� had informed him of the altcoin���s debut ahead of time. Sooooo, "Insider Trading" Investigator over? Thanks @lordoftrade and other twitter detectives for breaking this one wide open... someone should send a message to @BBC @BBCBreaking so they can update the article ?... haha #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/XLzuJJH6kt The user has since deleted the comment, which if true would add to the argument that insider trading occurred. Not just Coinbase, but CNBC itself has become embroiled in the Bitcoin Cash scandal after the show���s Fast Money segment published a tweet that seemed aligned with Ver���s position on the role of Bitcoin Cash in the crypto market. In comments to the tweet, Bitcoin Cash supporters claimed Fast Money���s message is biased and promotional. The network���s Marketing Manager, Gaby Wasensteiner, is married to an active Bitcoin Cash executive, who has been photographed with Ver.  Amidst accusations on social media of CNBC actively promoting Bitcoin Cash,  Wasensteiner retweeted her husband���s post about a Bitcoin Cash meetup he was seeking to create in London. We are building a #BitcoinCash meetup group in London. Our first event is likely to be on 12th Jan. Join us and spread the word! #LondonBCHhttps://t.co/SGlxJvZTgH Meanwhile, Coinbase���s CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong published a blog post on Dec. 20 that lays out its employee trading policy. In the post Armstrong also states that the platform is conducting an investigation into the possibility of insider trading prior to its launch of BCH, and promises to take action if necessary: ���If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies���������directly or indirectly���������I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.���	1
Blockchain analysis has been used by a UC Berkeley PhD candidate to identify sex trafficking rings, through the linking of Bitcoin payments made for online adult advertisements. Could automation and Blockchain analysis help law enforcers crack down on human traffickers? Human traffickers often reach their customers through advertisements in sources like Craigslist and Backpage.com. The research uses two tools - analyzing the writing style (stylometry) and Blockchain analysis to try and identify human trafficking rings. Machine learning is used to identify adult ads with similar writing styles, which could indicate that they are likely to come from a single source - a trafficking ring. American Express stopped processing payment for Backpage in 2014, while other credit card processors like Visa and Mastercard stopped in 2015, leaving Bitcoin as the only viable source of payment. Blockchain analysis is used to link payments made for various ads, again indicating a single source. Demasking these Bitcoin addresses would, however, require enforcement officials taking up additional investigation. The problem with the above method is that it is useful only as long as the traffickers pay from the same wallet and do not attempt to cover their tracks. Bitcoin mixers can easily obfuscate the Blockchain train and prevent linking of transactions. We can expect traffickers to be extra careful and take additional precautions, now that this research has been published. Moreover, the possibility of false positives is also high. Bitcoins sourced from a particular vendor and then used at Backpage could lead to false suspicions about a trafficking ring. Linkage of Bitcoin transactions only increases the likelihood of a trafficking ring being present and is not conclusive evidence. While human trafficking is a worldwide issue which is always on the radar of law enforcers, drugs are a bigger problem. When Silk Road, the darknet marketplace for drugs was flourishing, it primarily used Bitcoin as a medium of payment. However, the Blockchain trail did not help law enforcers track drug peddlers and shut down the website. Silk Road had its own tumbler which was used to mix Bitcoins. Law enforcers could still theoretically find out who bought Bitcoins from exchanges (primarily Mt. Gox at that time) and sent it to Silk Road, but that wouldn't help catch the drug peddlers. So the utility of Blockchain analysis in the Silk Road case was limited. The increased focus on using the Bitcoin Blockchain to unmask users, for activities ranging from tax evasion to sex trafficking, raises concerns about the privacy of ordinary users. Altcoins like Monero and Dash with a focus on protecting privacy of users could gain prominence in this scenario. Apart from mixers and CoinJoin transactions in Bitcoin, these altcoins provide cryptocurrency users an easy way to improve privacy.	2
Bitcoin is ending the week in much the same place it was trading Feb. 5 as sideways movement for much of the week sees prices hover just above $8000.   Cross-exchange data from Coinmarketcap shows Bitcoin beginning and closing the past seven days at around $8300, having slid to a low of $6111 Feb. 6 before peaking at $9109 on Saturday, Feb. 10.     The market remains influenced by regulatory activity in major trading markets such as India and the US. Cointelegraph additionally reported throughout the week that press attention surrounding the Indian and US moves was contributing to the volatility.   On social media, traders and commentators had made calls for a reversal in Bitcoin���s fortunes, which began in earnest towards the weekend before support broke above $9000.   Forecasting next week���s activity, Tone Vays on Friday suggested that resistance around $10,000 ���would be very hard to break.���   ���We have to cross the 128 [day] moving average (around $10,300); the 128 has been great support, now it���s going to be resistance,��� he added.   #Bitcoin Hits $9,000, so is $6,000 gonna be the low for 2018 or is there still elements to be nervous about? Let's look at the latest $BTCUSD charts now that more data is in.https://t.co/3nlYtZBXXZ  Altcoins have broadly moved in time with Bitcoin so far in 2018, with only Ripple producing short-lived countermoves over the past week.     Sunday saw moderate losses across the top 50 assets tracked by Coinmarketcap, with only a curious entry by new altcoin U.CASH, which spiked over 1000% in 24 hours to claim the number 33 spot by market cap at a capitalization of $645 mln, distorting the trend.	1
Crypto exchange Coinbase intends to go public via a direct listing on April 14, based on recent information. This means shares of Coinbase stock will become available for trading on the Nasdaq, bringing another part of the crypto space into mainstream finance.  Confusion can accompany activity in the traditional financial world, though. Companies, accredited investors and other entities engage with stocks and finance in various measures, but what about everyday retail participants? If a retail trader wants to buy Coinbase stock when it lists on the Nasdaq or wants to buy it before the listing day, how do they go about doing so? ���With a direct listing, no retail brokerage firms have any role in that listing before it���s available on an exchange,��� a spokesperson for financial service provider Fidelity told Cointelegraph. ���The first time any retail investor has access to a stock that comes on an exchange through a direct listing is when it���s available to everyone, just like existing stocks, such as AAPL, FB and MSFT.���  The case is the same with Coinbase���s direct listing, based on an article from NerdWallet. Coinbase has chosen ���COIN��� as its stock ticker, a blog post from Coinbase reveals. Coinbase has grown substantially since its founding in 2012. Back in 2018, Coinbase held an $8 billion valuation after running a funding round in which it secured $300 million. Quarter one of 2021 yielded favorable numbers for the outfit, during which Coinbase���s revenue totaled $1.8 billion, a high for the company.  Direct listings differ from initial public offerings in a number of key areas, including underwriter involvement, although both serve as avenues for companies to go public. Initial public offerings involve underwriters, while direct listings do not. ���An underwriter is any party that evaluates and assumes another party���s risk for a fee,��� Investopedia explains, adding: Coinbase filed to go public with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission near the end of 2020. The company originally planned its direct listing to hit in March, but the exchange pushed the event to April after receiving and settling a $6.5 million penalty from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The fine arose from the government agency���s claims that Coinbase did not report exchange volume correctly. The fine also included that a worker fiddled with exchange volume numbers by ���self-trading.���  Prior to Coinbase���s stock listing, interested parties can trade Coinbase futures contracts using crypto derivatives exchange FTX, according to an FTX information document. The exchange launched the token-settled product in December 2020. ���Coinbase (CBSE) is a pre-IPO contract,��� FTX says on the trading page for the product, adding: Tokenized stocks on FTX represent ownership of their respective underlying stocks. Using its tokenized Tesla trading product as an example, FTX says in a help article on its website: ���These spot tokens are backed by shares of Tesla stock custodied by CM-Equity. They can be redeemed with CM-Equity for the underlying shares if desired.���  Tokenized stocks on FTX, as well as its CBSE pre-IPO contracts, result from cooperation between FTX and financial services outfit CM-Equity AG. FTX, however, is not open to customers of certain regions, such as the United States. ������Lowest price is relative to an investor���s trading strategy,��� the Fidelity spokesperson said, adding: ���Once a Fidelity customer decides what is a fair value for any stock, they can set a price alert for when the stock may hit their target price, they can set a limit order, or they can leg-in to the position over a regular schedule ��� e.g., $50/month ��� never more convenient since we offer fractional shares and $0 online commissions.���  Coinbase has already sold some of its shares. In March, it was revealed that private auction sales took place in which the price per share reportedly ranged from $350 to $375. Estimates put Coinbase at a $100 billion valuation. Later in March, it was reported that 114,850,769 Coinbase shares were registered by the company. The shares fall under the Class A common stock categorization.	1
Around $6 bln has been raised via ICOs in 2017. Almost 37 percent of that amount was made by only 20 ICOs. Names like Filecoin, Tezos or Bancor created lots of buzz, but what happened to their tokens afterwards? Can investors get higher returns by buying tokens a few months after initial offerings? The five largest ICOs from the top twenty by the amount raised show that returns on investment can reach up to 870 percent within three to four months. Please note that projects whose tokens are not tradable or traded for less than two months were not included in the review. The data was collected and processed within an ICORating agency research. Returns since ICO (USD): +1,138% Progress: Tezos may have been one of the most promising ICOs of 2017, as its technology was intended to simplify launches for new projects and to compete with Ethereum. Though the project���s roadmap contains no exact deadlines, and its founder Arthur Breitman posted the last tech update on Dec. 22, it seems that the platform would not be launched anytime soon. Moreover, Tezos has recently been filed with two lawsuits and accused of violating both US federal and state law. Its tokens were qualified as securities and, by not registering them as such, the company violated the Security Act. The project was also accused of fraud as tokens were distributed under the pretense of charitable contributions. Some of the investors have asked for refunds, but their claims were refused, which was explained by the fact that this was not presupposed by the initial agreement. Despite these issues, the price of Tezos tokens has never dropped below the ICO price and has shown a 12.4x return in US dollars since the ICO. Returns since ICO (USD): +108% Bancor aims to introduce an easy way to issue smart-tokens and convert them with no counterparty. The project has made progress since Launch Festival 2017 when its app was only in test-mode. Now it can convert 14 cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and BTN token, but the token-issuing option is not available yet. Bancor token demonstrates the lowest returns for ICOs among the reviewed. Returns since ICO (USD): +1,521% Progress: Status combines a mobile messenger and a browser to connect smartphone users with the Ethereum ecosystem. The founders stated that the beta-version was scheduled for Q2���Q3 2017 and that it would provide end-users with features such as encrypted messaging, a P2P exchange, an Ether wallet, etc. The release seems to be delayed, though that doesn���t mean there is no progress. From weekly public reports posted by Status team leaders, it seems that sooner or later the project would be finished. Nevertheless, this couldn���t guarantee success with users. Besides, the SNT token price is not growing exponentially, as no product uses their utility token to date. At the same time, there is no reason for a huge drop as the project is following its roadmap. All in all, the SNT token has multiplied its price by 16.2 since the ICO. Returns since ICO (USD): +1,023% Progress: Kin I��O was rated as low risky and its hype level seems high. The Kin ecosystem seems to be another promising approach to so-called ���conversational commerce,��� which is still only a concept for almost every messenger except WeChat. For the ICO market though Kin might  be one of the most viable projects as it has a tangible product and 300 mln active users per month. It is still a question how the average Kik user will liquidate their Kin. Also, there is no news about Kin���s integration with Kik which was scheduled for last quarter of 2017. Kin���s plan to move from Ethereum also doesn���t seem to be straightforward as it was faced with investor complaints. Despite Kik���s advantages over the very similar Status platform, Kin tokens demonstrate one and a half the return, which is about +1,023 percent since the ICO. Returns since ICO (USD): +550% Progress: TenX claimed to simplify the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life. The project has already launched its app. Its Android version has been downloaded over 50,000 times since August despite being in beta mode. The app is still in development and its expansion is planned for the beginning of 2018. After exponential growth, the price of the PAY token dropped from $5.33 to less than $1.5, but overall it has added 550 percent in value since the ICO. PAY token was also included in William Mougayar High Growth Cryptoassets Index, which is comprised of a strategic selection of undervalued crypto-assets. In 2017 the most successful projects by ICO were those, which promised to make Blockchain and cryptocurrencies more suitable for common use: exchanges, deposits, payments, token issuing, rewards, etc. But that does not mean the project���s focus guarantees ICO and post-ICO success. Generally, it is much more important for projects to have viable documentation and business goals, to follow the product roadmap and to inform investors about the progress on a regular basis. At the moment the two major problems of the post-ICO market might be overestimation and transparency. For investors and funds, it is crucial to have relevant project evaluation both before and after ICO. Unfortunately, it is not always obvious for founders, -- some of them go off media or rating radars after the successful initial offering and make projects susceptible to informational attacks. Another reason is that founders could overestimate their project and deadlines to create more buzz before ICO. Thus the implementation is delayed, and investors are constrained to sell tokens. These reasons, as well as other circumstances, could make token price drop down. Anyway, $6 bln was invested in tokens last year, so that the  post-ICO rating would matter a lot in 2018.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has seen another major growth spurt as the altcoin���s lead developer pronounces Bitcoin (BTC) dead. Capping what appears to be Bitcoin���s 191st life, Deadal Nix tweeted Tuesday as BCH began picking up steam that the August hard fork meant Bitcoin already no longer existed. ���Bitcoin is dead. It was split in two. There is Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Core/Legacy. Deal with it,��� he wrote in response to a warning about BCH from online commentator Alphonse Pace. The Core community was quick to respond, Charlie Shrem noting that Nix publicly describes himself as a ���pro shitlord.��� Says the lead dev of ���bitcoin cash��� who���s twitter profile says ���professional shitlord��� I���ll take Core over shitlord any day. https://t.co/esKIp4ueNN The continuing tension comes as BCH is on the way to doubling its USD value since recent lows of $947 Nov. 17. Current cross-exchange data shows prices approaching $1,600 per coin, yet November���s second maneuver is having a markedly lesser impact on Bitcoin prices. BTC is trading around $8,200, near all-time highs poster several days ago. During BCH���s previous bull run, Bitcoin plummeted, albeit to quickly regain value to continue to break $8,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, the strange consequences of BCH���s ���malicious��� hard fork are still playing out, with the Bitcoin Clashic Twitter account putting out calls for miner support.	1
Political uncertainty in the Middle East has risen to an all-time high, with Saudi Arabia arresting the richest Arab in the world, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Could this result in a shift to Bitcoin, the digital safe haven, in the Middle East? Saudi Arabia has initiated a sweeping crackdown, ostensibly against corruption, today. King Salman has ordered the arrest of senior princes and ousted many senior officials from ministerial roles. The list of people arrested includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the richest Arab in the world. Prince Alwaleed was in the news recently for his negative views on Bitcoin, saying that Bitcoin would face an Enron-like collapse. While the public reason given by King Salman for the arrests is his drive against corruption, many commentators believe that the King could be clearing the route for his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to take over as the King. From early June 2017, Qatar's neighbors - Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and UAE have imposed a blockade on the country, accusing the country of harboring Islamic militants and maintaining a relationship with Iran, Saudi Arabia's staunch enemy. Qatar is a small country in the Middle East, with large natural gas reserves. According to the World Bank, it is the country with the highest per capita GDP based on purchasing power parity ($127.5K in 2016). It will also play host to the 2022 Fifa World Cup. Many believe that the actual reason for Qatar's neighbors imposing a blockade is Qatar's support for Al Jazeera, a news organization which has aired views contrary to the established position in the Middle East. Given the absolute power enjoyed by governments in the Middle East, an independent news channel in the region has raised many hackles. Bahrain is one of the smallest economies in the oil-rich Middle East, with its GDP five percent the size of that of Saudi Arabia. Its economy is oil dependent and the recent lull in oil prices has resulted in its economy getting strained. The Central Bank of Bahrain has pegged its currency to the US dollar (0.376 Bahrain Dinar = 1 US dollar), but this has come under strain with dwindling foreign currency reserves. According to Bloomberg, Bahrain has approached Saudi Arabia for support to stave off a financial crisis and impending devaluation. Currency devaluation in Bahrain would spark a contagion effect in the Middle East, where most currencies are pegged to the US dollar. Misconduct by governments, either in the political or monetary space, results in people trying to find safe havens for their wealth. Traditionally this has been gold, but Bitcoin is fast developing as an alternate safe haven, with its decentralized and boundary-less nature. The Middle East is strategically important, both because of its vast oil and natural gas reserves and the tremendous wealth of its citizens. If rich sheikhs in the Middle East think that parking a fraction of their wealth in Bitcoin makes sense given the uncertainty in the region, Bitcoin's price could scale new highs.	1
The past week of confusion and friction over cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea continues to unfold as accusations surface of government officials practicing insider trading, local news source Chosun reports. According to the local reports on Thursday, Jan. 18, some government officials from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), who were aware of forthcoming announcements about either a full ban or significant restrictions on trading, bought and sold cryptocurrency just before that information went public. FSS chief Choi Hyung-sik confirmed the suspicions in a meeting Thursday, admitting: ���We have confirmed the intelligence. We have confirmed that some public officials have done such an act��� The allegations of activity tantamount to corruption further weakens Seoul's position after its highly-unpopular and contradictory announcements on cryptocurrency regulation caused mass public outcry. A public petition calling for a reversal of the restrictions as well as the firing of some high-profile ministers has now attracted more than 200,000 signatures, meaning it requires a government response within 30 days. Meanwhile, the legality of any insider crypto trading based on classified knowledge is not clear at the moment. Ironically, cryptocurrency���s undefined legal status means the practice cannot be treated as trading involving fully-regulated instruments. A FSS official stated: ���There is no code of ethics and no code of conduct for virtual currency investment in FSS regulations, so it���s difficult to say about punishment at this stage.��� Chosun also points out that the officials could be accused not of insider trading, but more generally of ���the misuse of internal information.���	0
Despite its price volatility, Bitcoin is likely to make more millionaires. Panos Mourdoukoutas, chair of the department of economics at LIU Post in New York City, whose works are published by Forbes and The New York Times, thinks Bitcoin is likely to turn more individuals into millionaires before its price dives again. Bitcoin recently reached an all-time high of $3,000 this June after a huge correction to $2,682 from $2,957 in the period of two days. This is after tech billionaire Mark Cuban reportedly called Bitcoin's recent price surge a bubble. However, this is not the case since the cryptocurrency is showing an uptrend, based on its recent price of $2,831 and its continuing upward trend. Mourdoukoutas shared a partially similar viewpoint to Cuban's. Both had similar claims that Bitcoin's price would drop after a substantial surge, however, he stopped short of calling Bitcoin a bubble. Mourdoukoutas mentioned that the digital currency made many "overnight millionaires" - individuals who invested into BTC when it was worth just a portion of its current rate. He also mentioned that Bitcoin will reach new highs, making more millionaires in the course of the action, before "returning down to earth." Mourdoukoutas added that one of the reasons for the increased investment in the cryptocurrency is the "ultra-low��� rate of interest environment, makings the trade of Bitcoin an enticing proposition. In addition, there is a growing mistrust in the currencies of several nations, following government policies that have pushed more investors into the cryptocurrency. Mourdoukoutas said that one of these policies is the act by federal governments to provide new treasury bonds at record low rates to cover the old financial obligations with brand-new ones. For instance, Japan sells treasuries that yield nearly absolutely nothing for the state, however, the nation's debts amount to approximately 250 percent of the country���s GDP. The teacher mentioned that China's treasury yields "something," however, no one knows the specific quantity of the "informal financial obligation". The fact that there is a substantial quantity of financial obligations linked to the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen diminishes the confidence of investors. Given that there is Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that has increased its worth by 125 percent in 2016, investors in Asia have taken advantage of the possibility to invest more into the digital currency. The economics professor also highlighted another government policy which might decrease trust in a country's nationwide currency. This relocation is when governments wish to eliminate the old currency notes, as held true in India and Venezuela. Such incidents, according to Mourdoukoutas, is one of the reasons why Bitcoin price has risen. Mourdoukoutas further commented that there are particular advantages which make Bitcoin a much better hedge than traditional ones, such as gold. He added that the millennial generation is one of the greatest supporters of the cryptocurrency as they understand BTC much better than the "baby-boomer generation.��� Mourdoukoutas shared: "Unlike gold, for instance, Bitcoin is a hassle-free medium of payment around the globe.��� The economics professor expounded that Bitcoin's supply is anticipated to be restricted to 21 mln. Compared to gold, there is no deficiency of the mineral considering that when the rate of gold rises, it supplies more incentive for gold miners to mine for gold. Finally, Mourdoukoutas specified that the financier buzz around Bitcoin continuously helps the cryptocurrency to go upwards, as a growing number of financiers are becoming familiar with the digital currency, and can utilize ETFs (exchange-traded funds) to "conveniently participate in the market."	1
In his recent appearance on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin revealed he profited more than $4 million from a $25,000 investment that he made into Dogecoin (DOGE) during 2016. But true to form, he gave it all away to charity. Dogecoin was created in December 2013 and sought to capitalize on the popularity of the then-popular Shiba Inu-inspired dog meme, with Buterin describing DOGE as among the first ���fun coins��� launched into the burgeoning crypto asset ecosystem. Although he was impressed by the community that had formed around DOGE, Buterin joked about the lack of investment thesis informing his decision, stating: Although Buterin stated that DOGE ���did really well��� over the following years, he recalled being caught off-guard by the speculative frenzy that resulted from Elon Musk���s fascination with the meme-coin. Musk���s interest in DOGE appeared to stem after a 2019 community vote that revealed the SpaceX founder to be the project���s most-desired hypothetical CEO in 2019 ��� four years after Dogecoin���s founder had abandoned the project. ���At the end of 2020, Elon Musk started talking about Dogecoin, and the market cap just shot up to $50 billion [...] It shot up multiple times,��� said Buterin. He recounted being in lockdown in Singapore when the price of DOGE shot up 775% from $0.008 to $0.07 over the course of a single day, thinking: ���Oh my god, my DOGE is worth, like, a lot!��� After selling half of his DOGE at the local top, Buterin says he felt like ���an amazing trader,��� until, ���of course, the price went back up from $0.04, then to $0.07, then to $0.50.��� Assuming that Buterin held on to the remaining 50% of this DOGE stash, Ethereum���s co-creator would currently be hodling nearly $20 million worth of the dog token. Despite backing the project relatively early into its development, Buterin emphasized he did not anticipate that Dogecoin would capture the mainstream imagination and reemerge as a leading crypto asset by capitalization:	1
The Synthetix DAO has added some new, perhaps surprising voices to its governance.  Today the synthetic asset protocol announced a $12 million dollar fundraise led by venture capital firms Paradigm, Coinbase Ventures, and IOSG. The funds purchased SNX tokens directly from the DAO treasury, and ���will contribute where possible by providing liquidity in the form of SNX collateral, and also participate in its rapidly evolving community governance system,��� the announcement reads.  ���We���re excited about supporting the synthetixDAO as it builds the leading synthetic asset platform,��� said Paradigm investment partner Arjun Balaji. ���Synthetix has one of the best communities in crypto and we���re glad to be a part of it.��� The investment is notable for being among the first instances of funds investing directly with and through a project governed by a DAO. How VCs interact with DAO-governed protocols has been a hot topic of late, with some arguing that VCs shouldn���t get preferential treatment, while others say that VCs are welcome, like any entity, to participate in an open ecosystem.  A recent Tweet thread from Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, made the case for working with VCs ��� so long as they���re the right ones. 1/ I think it's worth briefly explaining the positive and mutually beneficial experience I've had working with @paradigm @a16z @usv and other investors.I've seen a lot of negativity and propaganda so I think it's worth sharing my personal experience.Quick thread: Jordan Momtazi, a core contributor to Synthetix DAO (and the former Synthetix COO pre governance decentralization), agrees that it���s all about which funds a protocol is working with.  ���Many VC���s don���t add much value. The delta between quality VC���s and the rest is quite large,��� he said in a statement to Cointelegraph.  Each of the three VCs that joined in on the $12 million raise are bringing additional value to the table that an individual investor might not be able to muster, Momtazi said.  ���Paradigm has been helping the protocol recruit talent through their in house HR and network. They���ve also been actively helping think through our v3 planning. Providing insights into approaches around our re-architecture,��� Momtazi said. ���Coinbase ventures has helped with connectivity across many functions, both internally and externally.��� IOSG, meanwhile, is helping to spearhead Synthetix���s push into China by assisting with the hiring of a China regional lead, as well as with ���in person roadshows and creating educational content in Chinese.��� The raise comes during an especially productive period for Synthetix. The team recently announced the launch of synthetic Tesla stock, and SNX was among the tokens that filings show may be the next to be listed as a Grayscale investment trust.  It���s momentum Momtazi hopes the latest members of the community can help carry forth.	1
Earlier this month, Aragon co-founder Luis Cuende revealed that he sees the price of Ethereum, which remains at around $261, hitting $1,000 in the long run. In an interview with Sindre Hopland, the media producer at Itnig, Cuende explained that the Ethereum market along with the ICO industry is growing at an exponential rate. Both large-scale and small companies are actively investing in the efficiency of Ethereum network in automating operations with the utilization of smart contracts. Aragon, which in essence is similar to EOS, the company that completed the largest ICO to date at $185 mln, is attempting to provide an infrastructure in which businesses can utilize Ethereum and smart contracts to lower expenses and costs of operations. Cuende led the company to raise more than $28 mln in its initial coin offering (ICO) for ANT tokens, which was endorsed by early-stage venture capital firm focused on Bitcoin, Blockchain and virtual reality, established by billionaire investor Tim Draper���s son Adam Draper. During the interview, Cuende revealed his bold prediction for Ethereum price and explained that he sees Ethereum���s native token Ether hitting $1,000 in the long run. ���I thought it was expensive one year ago when it was at 13 dollars, but today when I see the possibilities created by the technology, I think it's cheap. I believe Ethereum will be worth $1,000 in a couple of years,��� said Cuende.  However, Cuende was also quick to admit that the cryptocurrency sector along with the Ethereum industry, are yet to offer viable products and fulfill their promises to establish a global decentralized ecosystem of applications. Cuende noted: ���Crypto hasn���t achieved its promises just yet. When it achieves 10 percent of what it promised to do, I can't even imagine how crazy that will be.��� Many analysts in the past including Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam have repeatedly informed the community in various blog posts and informative writings that Ethereum is yet to scale to a large-scale network for applications. The vast majority of ICOs are still in their pre-alpha testing phase, including some of the largest ICOs in the history of the cryptocurrency industry including Bancor and EOS. Hence, Cuende emphasized the importance and the necessity of ICOs to prove their value to their worthy investors and early-stage ICO participators. Over the past year, major economies and countries including the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines have fully legalized and regulated the Bitcoin industry and market, with India, the world���s third-largest economy, expected to follow the trend. Chinese financial regulators from the People���s Bank of China emphasized in the past that Ethereum is going in the right direction, with the establishment of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which is encouraging and guiding multi-billion conglomerates including JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and BHP Billiton to launch applications on top of the Ethereum network. If the Ethereum network can scale efficiently with tens of millions of users deploying actively utilized smart contract-based applications, as Cuende emphasized, Ethereum has the potential of hitting $1,000, as does Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.	2
CryptoKitties, the massively popular Ethereum-based digital kitten breeding app and collectibles marketplace, has surpassed major decentralized cryptocurrency exchange EtherDelta to become the largest decentralized application (dapp) on the Ethereum protocol by gas consumption.  According to ETH Gas Station, the CryptoKitties Ethereum smart contract accounted for 13.94 percent of Ethereum���s transaction volume over the last 1,500 blocks, surpassing non-custodial cryptocurrency exchanges EtherDelta and ShapeShift. CryptoKitties allows anyone within the Ethereum network to purchase or sell breedable cartoon kittens. The decentralized structure of the Ethereum network disallows the alteration of ownership or production of fraudulent kittens, providing value to the kittens as collectibles with scarcity and rarity. ProductHunt founder Ryan Hoover explained that CryptoKitties is essentially the first Ethereum-based decentralized Pokemon-like game, in which users can collect and breed digital kittens. The key difference between CryptoKitties and other games like Pokemon and Tamagotchi is that through a decentralized marketplace, users can purchase or sell breedable kittens with Ether.  As shown by Crypto Kitty Sales, three of the rarest and expensive digital kittens on CryptoKitties were sold for $114,573, $81,549, and $69,600 respectively, amounting more than 572 Ether. The CryptoKitties dapp gained popularity amongst Ethereum users and members of the global cryptocurrency community primarily due to its unique model and its strategy. The CryptoKitties development team noted that the platform was created for everyone in the cryptocurrency sector, and it is not limited or exclusive to a handful of users and organizations. ���The future is exciting. And we believe that Blockchain is the future���but Blockchain is about as approachable as a bunch of ones and zeroes. We want a future for everyone, not one exclusive to Bitcoin miners, VCs, ICOs, and other equally fun acronyms,��� said the CryptoKitties team. Techcrunch reported that $1.3 mln worth of cartoon kittens on the dapp have been traded. Users have spent more than a million dollars on purchasing cartoon kittens on the platform over the past few weeks. The growth rate of the CryptoKitties platform has increased to a point in which it had led to an Ethereum network congestion. ���Due to network congestion, we are increasing the birthing fee from 0.001 ETH to 0.002 ETH. This will ensure your kittens are born on time! The extra is needed to incentivize miners to add birthing txs to the chain. Long-term solution will be explored very soon,��� said CryptoKitties on Dec. 4. As Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam stated, Ethereum-based dapps like EtherDelta have the potential to target and penetrate a multi-trillion dollar industry in the long-term, given that Ethereum���s scaling issues can be solved within the next few years. The cryptocurrency exchange market alone is already a multi-billion dollar industry. Soon, Ethereum-based exchange protocols will be able to provide infrastructures to compete with leading financial institutions in the global market. In contrast to such ambitious projects, dapps like CryptoKitties serve a much smaller purpose, to simply entertain the cryptocurrency community with a collectibles-based game. But, CryptoKitties has utilized the Ethereum Blockchain network to create the first successful decentralized game, and in the long-term, developers in the traditional gaming industry could explore and evaluate the success story of CryptoKitties.	2
There is actually more than 21 million Bitcoin (BTC) in the world, ratings agency Weiss has claimed as it eyes major exchanges. In a tweet on May 25, Weiss ��� well known for its controversial cryptocurrency posts ��� argued that exchanges use leverage to give the impression of there being more Bitcoin than what actually exists. ���Unpopular Opinion: The supply of #Bitcoin is higher than 21 million,��� the post reads. Exchanges leverage the existing supply of any #crypto asset in much the same way banks leverage the supply of fiat money. Weiss appeared to critique the exchange model more broadly. Custodial exchanges, still overwhelmingly popular despite recent mass outflows, involve an element of trust that the firm considers undesirable. The tweet concludes:  The only protection is to hold your own crypto. Not your keys, not your crypto. The actual verifiable number of mined Bitcoins is currently 18.3 million, but not all are in circulation. Estimates, for example, consider around 4 million to be lost irretrievably. As Cointelegraph reported, exchanges��� reserves of Bitcoin are now at their lowest since late 2018. The shift in sentiment came independently of efforts by Bitcoin users to raise awareness of the risks of third party custody.  Bitcoin exchange reserves 1-year chart. Source: CryptoQuant Specifically, the Proof of Keys event, which occurred twice on January 3 of both this year and last, seemed to have little impact on exchange reserves.  Weiss, meanwhile, has itself felt the heat from its cryptocurrency ratings, which routinely placed certain altcoins above Bitcoin. Objections stem from the idea that Bitcoin���s technology has yet to see a genuine competitor that improves upon its capabilities while convincing existing users to abandon the BTC network.  At present, Bitcoin is top with an overall score of A-. Dragging it down, according to Weiss, is ���market performance,��� which scores a C-.	1
Local UK cryptocurrency HullCoin is advancing its status and even offering users tax cuts. As the Financial Times reports this week, HullCoin, which has existed for several years, has grown its user base and attracted government funding. ��240,000 is now earmarked to propagate the scheme, which rewards users who perform socially valuable tasks in the local community. Users then benefit from immutable evidence of their work and its impact, recorded on the Blockchain. Now, additional benefits could even see local authorities reduce payments of council tax - a monthly fee citizens pay for state services - for valuable HullCoin holders. ���Using Blockchain technology, we embed time-stamped evidence of the positive social outcome of whatever activity has been undertaken into the coin itself,��� David Shepherdson, CEO of developer Kaini Industries told the publication. ���This creates a distributed ledger of all the socially good things happening in the community and gives people a social CV they can show to a prospective employer.��� HullCoin is one of several extant local crypto schemes operating in UK cities, other examples including the Liverpool Local Pound and Local Pound East London. Meanwhile, retailers in Hull can already exercise their moral compass to offer varying discounts to HullCoiners based on the alleged robustness of their Blockchain social record. ���If the good thing was quitting smoking or taking someone���s dog for a walk, I might offer 10 percent or 15 percent off,��� the owner of a local chain of pie shops explained. ���Whereas if someone has given blood or pulled a person from a burning car, I might give a 100 percent discount.��� Secret symbol ��� 6: W What is this?	2
Japan���s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the fourth largest bank in the world, will launch its own digital currency MUFG coin, local news publication Mainichi.jp reported Sunday, Jan. 14. MUFG is the largest financial company in Japan and is set to become the first Japanese bank to issue a virtual currency, Mainichi.jp reports. The bank had plans to develop a cryptocurrency as far back as 2016. According to Mainichi.jp, the launch date has now been finalized and is intended to take place in the FY 2018. Based on Blockchain technology, MUFG coin will allow users to conduct instant person-to-person transactions as well as shop with lower fees. MUFG stated the company will process all the transactions from its cryptocurrency���s network, claiming that such an approach will help improve the stability of the coin. The bank also plans to peg one MUFG coin to one Japanese yen in order to maintain people���s confidence in the new cryptocurrency. Another local company, the e-commerce giant DMM Group, launched its own 7-asset cryptocurrency exchange on Jan. 11, which highlights the growing level of Blockchain tech adoption in Japan. In contrast to the governments of neighboring China and South Korea, the Japanese government has adopted a more welcoming approach to regulating the cryptocurrency market, which has likely had a positive impact on the growth of the industry in the country.	2
Co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) Vitalik Buterin criticized centralized exchanges, saying that he hopes they will ���burn in hell,��� in an interview with a TechCrunch journalist Jon Evans, July 6.  Buterin has reiterated his positive stance on decentralization, claiming that by developing ���better��� decentralized platforms, the  crypto community should be able to take away the ���stupid King making power��� from centralized crypto exchanges. ���I definitely personally hope centralized exchanges burn in hell as much as possible.��� The creator of Ethereum criticized centralized platforms for having the ability to decide which cryptocurrencies ���become big.��� According to Buterin, they do this by charging ���these crazy ten to fifteen million dollar listing fees.��� He then added that further decentralization would better satisfy the ���blockchain values��� of ���openness and transparency.��� Decentralized exchanges (DEX���s), unlike centralized ones, are built in a such way as to allow users to retain ownership of their cryptocurrencies and private keys. However, DEX���s also have disadvantages - the relative lack of liquidity, compared to their centralized counterparts, being one of the examples. In the interview, Buterin cited one example to demonstrate the advantages of the current decentralization of Ethereum: ���if someone puts a gun to [his] head and tells [him] to write a hard fork patch,��� he would definitely do so. However, ���relatively few��� users would then download and run the update, and that, according to Buterin, ���is called decentralization.��� The degree of decentralization of Ethereum itself has been put in question by some experts, who cite, for example, the possibility of collusion between mining pools to manipulate the network. As of press time, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of around $47.5 billion.	2
Bitcoin (BTC) has rapidly corrected its monthly losses Friday, September 21, after markets rallied to send prices above $6,700 for the first time in two weeks. Data from Cointelegraph���s price tracker and Coin360 confirms a strong performance for Bitcoin, which had seen a week of flat trading closer to $6,200.  Market visualization from Coin360 The move upwards, which occurred over several hours, came as news broke that U.S. regulators had again postponed their decision on the VanEck/ SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), but had not rejected it outright. At press time, BTC/USD was trading around $6,707 an increase of about 5 percent on the day, taking prices back to the range they hovered in during mid-August.  Bitcoin weekly price chart.

Sky News has reported today, March 18, that Twitter is considering implementing a ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising in two weeks according to an as-of-yet unconfirmed report. Twitter had not responded to a request for confirmation of the alleged crypto ad ban by press time. Twitter���s reported crypto ad ban would come in the wake of both Facebook ban of crypto advertising in January, and Google���s recent update to its Financial Services policy that will ban crypto ads starting in June 2018. Sky News writes that they ���[understand] that the new advertising policy will be implemented in two weeks and currently stands to prohibit advertisements for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), token sales, and cryptocurrency wallets globally.��� Twitter has experienced an influx of fake accounts pretending to advertise cryptocurrency giveaways, often by users posing as famous crypto sphere personas like Litecoin���s Charlie Lee.	0
Arizona State University (ASU) has announced a partnership with the digital currency Dash that will provide $350,000 to ���accelerate research, development, and education in ways that advance blockchain transaction speed, efficiency, security, and expand its uses.��� The funds will be allocated as follows: The $350,000 is funded by Dash, via a successful treasury proposal. Director of ASU���s Blockchain Research Lab, Dragan Boscovic, commented: ���ASU welcomes this initiative and is ready to play its role in creating a potent Blockchain research and innovation environment for young talents to develop practical Blockchain applications.��� When thinking about digital currencies, there���s a tendency for the community to focus on the development side of the equation. New versions of the software, updates to add new features, roadmaps and the like - these usually get far more attention than research. However, the new features that get everybody so excited are made possible by researchers who discover the means and methods to add them. While Dash���s Core DAO (distributed autonomous organization) is focused on development, marketing and the day-to-day aspects of maintaining a digital currency, there are at least two research groups working to move the project forward. Dash Labs is a DAO founded by Dash founder Evan Duffield, based in Hong Kong, that is working to develop hardware solutions to enable on-chain scaling using massive blocks. Likewise, researchers at ASU are working on researching ways to improve Dash and solve the problems of cryptocurrency in general. Last summer, Dash funded ASU���s Blockchain Research Lab with a $50,000 donation. Dash Core Team CEO Ryan Taylor wrote: ���Initial research [will] focus on throughput capacity and latency performance of blockchain technology, model and assess it for different network architectures (including Dash's multi-tiered architecture), applications, and use cases to propose a "scalability" deployment guide and best practices.��� Taylor notes that the partnership is exclusive: ���Until now, the majority of Blockchain research has been focused on Bitcoin, with minimal focus on other Blockchain applications���The sponsorship incorporate[s] Dash as the exclusive digital currency for ongoing academic research.��� Dash isn���t the only digital currency project to partner with a major university. In the summer of 2015, MIT launched the Digital Currency Initiative and solicited donations which were used to hire three full-time Bitcoin developers. This move followed the effective collapse of the Bitcoin Foundation, which had been providing much of the funding for development. None of the funds actually come from MIT, rather, they come from outside donors and are funneled through the Digital Currency Initiative. By May 2016, MIT had raised $900,000 to fund these developers��� salaries. Later that year, this number had risen to $2 million. This funding is crucial, as Nasdaq points out: ���Funding Bitcoin development seems to have always been problematic.��� While some developers are willing and able to work full-time on open source projects like Bitcoin without compensation, most are not. Therefore, funding is desperately needed to maintain and advance the project. While MIT has serious fundraising muscle, dependence on the altruism of others is always a shaky proposition. While most digital currency projects rely on donations or an initial endowment (via ICO) to fund development, Dash has chosen a different method. Dash self-funds its development team, paying developer salaries out of a portion of the block rewards. Each month, 10% of the block rewards are reserved for successful treasury proposals. This means that as much as 6,650 DASH, worth $5.8 mln at press time, can be paid out directly by the network to those who manage to get their treasury proposals passed. Dash���s treasury system pays for marketing efforts, business development and integrations, conference sponsorships and more. Most important, Dash���s treasury pays Dash Core developers��� salary each month. At present, Dash employs a staff of 50, including 23 developers, four project managers, eight marketing specialists and 15 other administrative employees. These team members are paid a total of $300,000 per month, directly from Dash���s treasury system. No donations are necessary, and nobody is required to work for free. It���s this treasury system that funded the $350,000 partnership with ASU. One of Dash���s community members who goes by the handle of ���TanteStefana,��� wrote that while MIT funds Bitcoin���s development, Dash funds ASU���s research lab. She points out that the direction of influence is completely different: Bitcoin is at least partially dependent on the good will and fundraising efforts of MIT. This means the university could theoretically attempt to influence the project. With the partnership between Dash and ASU, money and influence flows in the opposite direction. It���s Dash that���s providing funding to ASU, making it impossible for the university to wield any influence over the project. Cointelegraph had the opportunity to speak with Dragan Boscovic, director of ASU���s Blockchain Research Lab, who commented on why Dash is such a good fit for the university: ���First, the Dash Core team���s offices are at ASU���s SkySong Innovation Center in Scottsdale, which is also where the Blockchain Research is located, enabling an excellent level of interaction between Dash, ASU faculty and students in a variety of disciplines, including computer science, engineering, business and law. Second, ASU is focused on ���building problem solvers and entrepreneurs,��� with a large Research and Development budget. Dash is one of the most innovative digital currency solutions with breakthrough algorithms, network topology and services. It���s a natural partnership. Third, there���s been quite a demand for an online graduate course focused on Blockchain technology enablers and applications. The course will help ensure that Blockchain finds an accelerated path toward rapid, mainstream adoption.��� When asked what set Dash apart from other digital currency projects, Boscovic replied: ���After partnering with Dash this summer and evaluating the possibilities of expanded collaboration, scholarships, Blockchain specialization courses and an accelerated research and innovation effort were identified as ways to move Blockchain applications forward. This speaks volumes about Dash network governance and their capability to self-fund strategic initiatives such as this one.���	2
A former lead developer for the Bitcoin network has postulated a possible future for the world���s most popular cryptocurrency, which includes an epic price prediction. Software developer Gavin Andresen published a recent blog post called ���A Possible BTC Future��� in which he predicts the demise of the Bitcoin network. Before Bitcoin (BTC) meets its end, it will have reached a price of $6 million per coin in 2061, Andresen predicts. Before you get too excited, he added that $1 million dollars today will be worth $6 million in the next 40 years due to massive inflation. The former Bitcoin client programmer admitted that his predictions were a ���little piece of science fiction��� but that the scenario was entirely possible. Transaction fees would cost around $7,500, but most transactions will not occur on the network itself, he added. Instead, they���d be on a mirrored chain using wrapped tokens to save on fees and improve speeds. The whales, who would control the entire thing, would continue to transact on the main chain. By 2100, these whales would recognize that the mining fee had dropped to near zero and so few transactions are occurring so they will shut it down, Andresen predicted. The silver lining is that there will still be 20 million or so BTC moving around on other blockchains, which would retain their value through scarcity, he added. Mathematically, the last Bitcoin is due to be mined in 2140. Currently, just 2.17 million, or 10.5%, remain to be mined. Andresen, who also founded the Bitcoin Foundation, stepped down from his lead role in 2014 and has receded from the spotlight in recent years. In 2016, he was ostracized from the Bitcoin community for supporting Craig Wright���s claims to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. He later admitted that this was a mistake and testified that he had been ���bamboozled��� by Wright���s claims in June 2020.	2
One of the most powerful men in tech thinks that the Metaverse ��� a term for a series of interlinked, persistent virtual worlds with self-contained economies ��� is just around the corner.  One of the most exciting use cases for blockchain and nonfungible tokens, enthusiasts inspired by Neal Stephenson���s Snow Crash have long been hoping for a VR/AR world with a crypto-powered internal market. Now, however, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks the technology to make it happen is on our doorstep.  Speaking at the virtual Computex conference, Huang said that he ���believe(s) we���re right on the cusp of��� the Metaverse and spoke glowingly of its potential, according to a transcript of a Q&A session he had with reporters ��� going as far as to say that users will one day use metaverses to ���simulate the future.��� ���There will be AR versions, where the art that you have is a digital art. You own it using NFT. You���ll display that beautiful art, that���s one of a kind, and it���s completely digital. You���ll have our glasses on or your phone. You can see that it���s sitting right there, perfectly lit, and it belongs to you. We���ll see this overlay, a metaverse overlay if you will, into our physical world,��� he said.  He noted that Nvidia is already using a VR version of Nvidia���s new office building to test these theories, a campus that the company has dubbed ���Voyager.��� Among the world���s largest manufacturers of GPUs, Nvidia used supercomputers to ���simulate architecture��� for Voyager, helping with the design and ecological efficiency, and eventually, the company will allow employees to attend work by wearing VR headsets from home and controlling robots to move about the physical office space, a joint VR/physical workplace hybrid.  Huang isn���t the only CEO who has weighed in on NFTs and the Metaverse as of late, though he���s certainly the most optimistic. In January, Fortnite founder Tim Sweeney said that NFTs are the most ���plausible��� path toward a functioning metaverse, but for now, they remain a ���speculative mess.���	1
There is a yearning for the younger generation to step up and take the mantle of leadership across the various fields of endeavour in Africa. With an average age of 78.5 years, Africa remains the continent with the oldest set of national leaders. This is a big factor behind the under-development of the second largest continent on earth. The campaign for newbreed industry and political leaders is getting louder especially as the largest country in the continent, Nigeria, prepares for its general election. The election is scheduled to take place in less than 15 months from the time of writing. Pushing out the old brigade in the politics seems insurmountable is a lack of youths in leadership posts in Africa. These young people are starved of necessary capacity to compete effectively. Migration in search of greener pastures has also had its toll on the youth of Africa and is chipping away at the continent���s supply of next generation of leaders. The emergence of Blockchain technology, coupled with its decentralized and non-regulated approach presents a breakout opportunity for a generation that is yearning to be heard. Across the African continent, almost all Blockchain startups and related technologies are pioneered by youths between 20 and 45 years of age. The revolution that awaits appears to lie on the bedrock of Blockchain technology. Young Africans in huge numbers are charting new courses without relying on the controlled systems of previous generations. Sensitization, awareness and education are tools that have been embraced by groups around the continent to initiate the emancipation process. Just recently, a group of young Nigerians known as Dash Squard organised a music and cultural festival. The two-day event which registered about 800 attendees involved performances by local artists, but increasing awareness about the digital currency Dash was the crux of the matter. Participants had Dash wallets set up on their mobile devices and were taught how to transact, with tickets and prizes denominated in Dash. Event organizer Oluwajuwon Micheal said: ���We opened a total of 300 new Dash wallets and also sent [each] of them Dash worth about $5, which everyone used in buying food, drinks and wares at the event. We also trained over 50 vendors that came for our event on the benefits of Dash and how they can send and buy Dash. We introduced Dash to the local artists that came for the events, and all of them were paid in Dash. Just two decided to sell some part of their Dash.��� The Cryptography Development Initiative of Nigeria (CDIN), led by Adeolu Fadele, is another group that is comprised mainly of young Africans focused on Blockchain as a tool for development across Africa. Having held its first ever conference in November 2017, the group is involved in various educational and awareness programs. It is also setup to collaborate with government agencies and professional institutions towards realizing Blockchain implementation. Other groups young Africans to find their voice include eBitcoinics, led by Nawaf Abdullah, and Blockchain Nigeria User Group, founded by Chimezie Chuta. The fact that it is taking so long for the younger generation to find relevance may not call for so much celebration. However the hope that it brings signifies a future of possibilities powered by technological advancement. The good thing about this development is that it remains an exclusive reserve of the next generation who can no longer be bullied out of the system by their current set of leaders. Apparently, there is indeed a future for the African continent which can no longer be taken away from those to whom it belongs.	1
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has issued a warning to would-be Bitcoin (BTC) buyers looking to follow Elon Musk���s investment strategy. Speaking to Bloomberg���s Emily Chang, Gates suggested Musk had access to sophisticated trade management techniques that the average investor isn���t privy to.  When asked about the susceptibility of Bitcoin to tumble in price in reaction to a mere tweet ��� undoubtedly a reference to Musk���s own social media posts ��� Gates said Musk was probably insulated from such market crashes: On Tuesday, a little over two weeks since Tesla���s $1.5 billion acquisition of Bitcoin was announced, the price of Bitcoin fell 20%, from $58,258 to $46,624. At the same time, almost $400 billion was wiped off the global market cryptocurrency market capitalization. Interestingly enough, the crash occurred just hours after Musk himself expressed the opinion that the then-current prices of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) were ���high.��� Whether this was a criticism or an attempt to deflect heat from a possible investigation into Musk���s influence on crypto prices, the entire market plunged in the aftermath. Gates said it would be a mistake for the average investor to blindly follow the mania of optimism surrounding Musk���s market moves, telling those who aren���t billionaires to ���watch out.��� He said: The Microsoft founder raised the point of Bitcoin���s energy consumption, suggesting that the cryptocurrency didn���t return much in the way of output.  ���There are things we invest in in society which produce output. Bitcoin happens to use a lot of energy. It happens to promote anonymous transactions ��� they���re not reversible transactions,��� said Gates. According to Gates, digital currencies aren���t necessarily a bad thing; he just thinks they should be transparent, reversible and, essentially, centralized. Gates went on to describe some of the work carried out using digital currencies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the Gates Foundation had used the technology to enable governments to distribute relief funds to their citizens.	1
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has said that he sold all of his Bitcoin (BTC) when the currency hit $20,000 in December 2017. Financial media outlet Business Insider Nordic reported on Wozniak���s comments on Jan. 24. Speaking at the Nordic Business Forum in Stockholm, Sweden, Wozniak said that he first bought an undisclosed quantity of Bitcoin when the crypto was at about $700 because he ���wanted to experiment with it.��� He then explained what he planned to do with it: ���My goal was to travel to a place like Stockholm, and go to restaurants and hotels that only accept bitcoin, and only use bitcoin when I travel.��� Still, when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of about $20,000, Wozniak reportedly sold all of his BTC holdings. He said: ���When it shot up high, I said I don't want to be one of those people who watches and watches it and cares about the number. I don't want that kind of care in my life [...] Part of my happiness is not to have worries, so I sold it all and just got rid of it.��� Wozniak concluded that he has ���never been into money in any way��� before disclosing ���I've never used Apple's stock app, I don't buy and sell stock.��� Furthermore, as Cointelegraph reported in June last year, Wozniak said that ���only Bitcoin is pure digital gold��� in an interview, reaffirming his belief in the cryptocurrency despite having already sold most of his holdings at the time. Even when he described blockchain as a bubble resembling that of the dotcom era during the same month, Wozniak still pointed out that Bitcoin is ���just amazing.��� Moreover, in October 2018, Wozniak also announced that he was co-founding EQUI Global, a blockchain-focused venture capital fund.	1
Japanese cryptocurrency investors will pay between 15 and 55 percent on their profits declared on their annual tax filings this year, Bloomberg reports Thursday, Feb. 8. The Japanese National Tax Agency had already ruled ���last year��� that capital gains on transactions of virtual currency are considered ���miscellaneous income,��� Bloomberg writes. The tax on cryptocurrency profits is higher than the around 20 percent tax levied on profits from stocks and foreign currencies, with the higher percentage tax applying to those who earn more than 40 mln yen a year (about $367,600). In comparison, South Korea had announced in Jan. that crypto exchanges will be taxed 24.2 percent, in line with the existing tax policy for corporations. According to Bloomberg, around 40 percent of Bitcoin (BTC) trading recently has been against the yen, meaning the country will receive a large revenue from taxing crypto.   Image source: Bloomberg Bloomberg reports that the Japanese National Tax Agency is creating a database of cryptocurrency investors, potentially to ensure enforcement of the tax laws, as well as retaining teams in Tokyo and Osaka to watch electronic trading. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also reported today that they have created a 10 person team of investigators aimed at tracking down crypto users that failed to report their profits in their tax declarations. Japan had recognized Bitcoin as a legal method of payment back in April 2017, a step towards helping the government prevent unregulated exchanges from hacks and mismanagement like the Mt. Gox meltdown in 2014.	0
The EOS blockchain is set to launch today, June 9, according to the results of a live-streamed vote that took place yesterday, June 8. Candidates to become the EOS blockchain���s so-called ���Block Producers��� ��� the equivalent of miners on the Bitcoin blockchain ��� voted ���Go��� in their latest voting session to make the EOS mainnet go live at 1:00pm UTC today. The community has yet to confirm that a successful launch has taken place as of press time. EOS LAUNCH IS A GO! The blockchain will launch at 1300 UTC Saturday. GO EOS!! #eosio #blockchain #cryptocurrency The news comes a week after EOS��� creator, blockchain software developer Block.one, released version 1.0 of the blockchain protocol EOSIO to the public. The EOSIO software is designed to let enterprise-level and ���community-driven��� businesses build scalable blockchain-based applications. EOSIO, which commentators expect to compete directly with Ethereum (ETH) as a protocol for building decentralized applications (Dapps), also received a new boost of funding last week. The same day Block.one released EOSIO 1.0 to the public, the company announced the launch a $50 mln fund to support the development of the EOSIO ���ecosystem���, in partnership with London-based blockchain investor, SVK Crypto. On June 1, Cointelegraph reported that EOS had completed its year-long token sale, raising a record-breaking $4 bln to become the largest Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in history. EOS is currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a market cap of $12.8 bln. The coin has seen just over 3 percent growth over the past 24 hours to press time, trading at $14.37.	1
The US���s two major financial regulatory authorities have announced that they will hold a dedicated hearing on virtual currencies on February 6, 2018. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will meet to discuss what an advance notice describes as their ���oversight role���, as the industry becomes an increasingly prioritized focus of lawmakers around the world. SEC chairman Jay Clayton will join CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo as chief witnesses. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies entered the public spotlight anew during last week���s World Economic Forum (WEF) 2018, with senior politicians from various major economies stating their intention to heighten legislative interaction. Calls for an international effort on crypto regulation have received support from France, Germany and others, the stage likely to be set for a major discussion during the G20 Summit in Argentina in March 2018. Clayton and Giancarlo have both also been vocal on the topic of cryptocurrency, discussing at length what they consider is the ���task��� of regulators in a co-authored article published in the Wall Street Journal during the WEF event. ���The CFTC and SEC, along with other federal and state regulators and criminal authorities, will continue to work together to bring transparency and integrity to these markets and, importantly, to deter and prosecute fraud and abuse,��� they concluded in the article, adding: ���These markets are new, evolving and international. As such they require us to be nimble and forward-looking[.]��� Earlier this month, the SEC told Wall Street trade groups it had ���outstanding questions��� about how their Bitcoin-based ETFs and mutual funds were regulation-compliant, and asked the sponsors to withdraw registration statements.	0
Bitcoin wallet support for SegWit2x is already a talking point as different plans could mean users lose Bitcoins. A response from Breadwallet to a user request about November���s SegWit2x hard fork demonstrates the ease with which newbie Bitcoin holders could unwittingly devalue their holdings. ���We are excited about SegWit,��� the response reads, ���and we will be sure to update the community [...] when you can send SegWit transactions.��� The news confirms comments from president of Breadwallet Aaron Voisine, who earlier this month wrote on Reddit: ���Breadwallet follows the majority of hashing power on the original PoW algorithm, SegWit2x or no, it follows the Nakamoto consensus.��� The implications for this lie in the fact that users with coins on the original BTC Blockchain risk losing them if Breadwallet opts for SegWit2x transaction support. Against a lack of clear information geared towards non-technical users, the issue of a further hard fork could result in their alienation. ���After the hardfork in November, Breadwallet will potentially be doing SegWit2x transactions. In that case, you risk losing your BTC sitting in the Bitcoin Blockchain,��� a further Reddit commentary reads in response to Voisine. ���Move your BTC out of Breadwallet before the hardfork.��� In the wider context of a likely second Bitcoin hard fork, SegWit2x is dividing industry opinion. While some commentators warn the event is similar to a ���hostile takeover��� of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core last week sought to debunk various myths associated with the concept.	0
At press time, the Bitcoin network is currently facing a backlog of over 135,000 unconfirmed transactions and fees have soared. This comes days after the proponents of the SegWit2x scaling solution announced they wouldn���t move forward with a doubling of Bitcoin���s block size due to lack of consensus. Since larger blocks are clearly dead in the water, there is only one apparent solution to the scalability problem: lightning network.In addition to all the private payment channels they are a part of, each peer would have one channel open to the Bitcoin Blockchain. The lightning network is scale-free, low-fee solution that has the potential to solve Bitcoin's scalability problem. As transaction volume on the Bitcoin network increases and the amount of data that can fit in a block remains the same, the Bitcoin economy suffers from a congested network. It is beginning to take longer than usual - up to several hours - for a transaction to be confirmed on the Bitcoin network and high transaction fees plague the network once again. Bitcoin���s blocks are limited to 1MB in size and the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network is rapidly increasing. The current block size is not sufficient to manage the number of transactions taking place on the Bitcoin network. The scalability problem can be thought of as feeding a large number of inputs through a narrow funnel. As large amounts of Bitcoin transaction data enter into the wide mouth of the funnel, the current amount of block space restricts the amount of transactions that the Bitcoin network can effectively process. The result is that transactions are written to the Blockchain more slowly than they are created by users. Over time a backlog develops, and transactions may wait hours to be included in a block. Users can ensure their transactions will be confirmed faster, but only for exorbitant fees.             The lightning network would implement a smart contract script into the Bitcoin network that would open private payment channels between a peer and all of the other peers they transact with. In addition to all the private payment channels they are a part of, each of peer would have one channel open to the Bitcoin Blockchain. Peers would transact amongst themselves in their private channels, but only the final outcome of the transaction would be broadcasted to the Blockchain. Because of this, miners would be processing far fewer transactions than they currently do.In theory, the lightning network makes peer to peer transactions more efficient, scale-free, and low cost. The software is being trial-run on the Litecoin network. The road to lightning network���s implementation first ran through the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit). This code separates signatures from transaction data to free up space in a block. SegWit gave the Bitcoin network the ability to process up to four times as many transactions into a block than before. In practice, however, it���s expected to merely double the capacity of the network. SegWit was needed to fix Bitcoin���s transaction malleability bug, which would have prevented lightning network from working. Along the way, miners and industry businesses came together in New York to agree to a compromise scaling proposal. The group agreed that SegWit would be allowed to activate as long as it was followed in November by a doubling of the block size to 2MB. However, on November 8th, SegWit2x was postponed due to lack of support. Since the Bitcoin core developers and the community were so strongly opposed to increasing the block size, the only solution that remains on the table is lightning network. On the lightning network, verifications would be instantaneous and concurrent with transactions. Private payment channels secured by multi-sig and and time locks allow transactions between peers to occur instantly. This means that individuals would no longer need to wait excessively long amounts of time for their transaction to be confirmed. Because private channels operate separately from the Bitcoin network, miners will have fewer transactions to process than they currently do. No longer will every single transaction get posted to the Blockchain; rather, only the final results of transactions between peers will be recorded. This leads to a more efficient use of the data limits on the current Bitcoin network. A scalable and inexpensive protocol like the lightning network has the ability to entice customers away from traditional financial intermediaries like Visa because of cost savings. Merchants will no longer have to pay exorbitant transaction fees, transportation costs, auditing costs and mediation costs. What���s even better is that your transaction will take place directly between you (party one) and the party you are doing business with (party two) without having to pass through a financial intermediary (third party) who has virtually nothing to do with the actual transaction at hand. It is becoming clear that the scaling issue is still haunting the Bitcoin network. Over the past few days, the price of Bitcoin has dropped while that of Bitcoin Cash has increased dramatically. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin that removed SegWit and increased the block size to 8MB. Many in the Bitcoin community who supported larger blocks as a scaling solution have likely moved to Bitcoin Cash. Other altcoins are working on scalability solutions as well; indeed, the ability to scale may well determine the top cryptocurrency a few years from now. If Bitcoin can���t, then others likely will. Already Ethereum is working on scaling by means of its Raiden Network, which uses payment channels similar to lightning network. Likewise, the digital currency Dash is experimenting with using ultra-large blocks to implement true on-chain scaling. The project just released an update that will increase the size of Dash���s blocks to 2MB when it fully activates, in about a month.	1
The Russian Ministry of Labor���s updated income, expenses and property declaration guidelines for government employees for reporting on 2017 includes a point about cryptocurrency, local media outlet Izvestia reports. The updated regulations state that government employees do not have to declare ���virtual currencies��� they obtained. The note about cryptocurrency was added to an already existing point that stated government employees were not required to declare ���goods and services in their natural forms,��� adding laconically ���as well as virtual currencies.��� Representatives from the Ministry of Labor told local news outlet RBC that they do not currently require cryptocurrency to be declared because of Russia���s general lack of legislation in the space, stating: "At present, approaches to the definition and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation at the legislative level are not defined.��� Russian officials have been required to make public declarations about their income since 2009. ���Experts��� pointed out to Izvestia that the ruling increased the risk of receiving bribes in cryptocurrency that would go undisclosed, according to the guidelines. However, Vladislav Tsepkov of the ���Business Against Corruption��� Center, an organization created by the Russian government in 2011 to protect entrepreneurs��� rights, told Izvestia that they saw the risk of government workers taking bribes in crypto as ���minimal,��� noting: ���But cryptocurrency is not a means of payment, it cannot be spent. If they [government workers] sell it and get real income, then it will need to be declared, so the risks are minimal.��� Izvestia noted that according to the same regulations, it is required that government workers declare gifts of ���real,��� or fiat, money from friends or family. These changes come at a time when Russian corruption is at an all time high. According to the statistics on the matter, corruption has increased more than thirty percent in Russia since 2008.  The Russian government has yet to create legislation that explicitly covers digital currencies. The country���s government and central bank generally have a negative stance on the subject, calling cryptocurrencies ���high risk,��� especially for mainstream investors.	2
The Bitcoin price is continuing on its unparalleled trajectory higher as Wednesday���s new all-time highs reach $13,200.   According to average exchange data from Coinmarketcap, Bitcoin was trading just under $13,000 at press time, having corrected after breaking the barrier for the first time.   A new record has become an almost daily occurrence for Bitcoin over the past week, with prices exploding 50 percent from $9,000 just days ago.     Cointelegraph reported yesterday as prices passed $12,000 that the imminent onset of regulated futures trading was a major driving factor for incoming investment.   As prices continue to grow, however, many are now beginning to ask when the historic bull run will slow - or reverse.   Tweeting his forecast Tuesday, Max Keiser, the commentator famous for his Bitcoin and Dash advocacy, said he imagined $15,000 would be the limit at which markets would take stock.    $15,000 will fall before Santa calls Rudolf. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/lQR4bNOrl3  Fellow major proponent John McAfee conversely left the future open-ended, saying that in any case, $14,000 will appear ���by the end of January.���   Legendary trader predicts Bitcoin at $14,000 by the end if 2018. Will the old guard ever get a clue??      BTC will surpass that by the end of January. The world has split in half. Make sure you are in the half that embraces the new paradigm. pic.twitter.com/f1opiLnUHM  McAfee has a vested interest in ensuring astronomic growth in Bitcoin continues as fast as possible, having doubled down on his pledge to eat his own penis on live TV if prices did not reach $1 mln by 2020.	2
A survey among the top fund managers of the world provides a good idea of where the smart money is going. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Managers survey of September 2017 indicates that Bitcoin is the most crowded investment right now, with a large proportion of bullish bets. The BAML survey was conducted from Sept. 1 to Sept. 7, and is a respected survey on Wall Street. More than 200 fund managers with assets under management of around $629 bln participated in this exercise. Hence this survey is a very good indicator of where the smart money is flowing. While Wall Street veterans have made contrasting remarks on the prospects of Bitcoin, fund managers seem to be believe that a lot of people are bullish on Bitcoin. "26 percent of the fund managers surveyed believe that Bitcoin is the most crowded investment right now." Bitcoin has given phenomenal returns in 2017, rising from ~$950 at the start of the year to a peak of $5000, before falling to ~$4200 currently. The causes have been many ��� the activation of SegWit which is expected to reduce congestion on the network, friendly regulations in Asian countries, institutional investors considering Bitcoin as a viable alternative asset class, and so on. There is a fear that there could be government action against Bitcoin, particularly in China, and that has caused the price to retrace this month. Bitcoin enthusiasts believe that this is a blip in the long term price trajectory of Bitcoin, and it will continue to appreciate in value as adoption increases. Other hot trades according to the BAML survey include long trades on the Nasdaq Composite Index (22 percent) and shorting the dollar (21 percent). Being long on the Nasdaq was deemed to be the most crowded investment in the last four surveys held during May ��� August 2017. Both trades have done well in 2017, with the Nasdaq Composite rising ~20 percent in 2017. When most people are bullish on Bitcoin and it has become a crowded investment, is it a good time to short Bitcoin? Being a crowded investment does not indicate that the rally in that asset class might be over. The Nasdaq Composite Index has continued to perform well in 2017, despite being viewed as a crowded trade for the most part of this year. Even people who oppose Bitcoin and call it a fraud (like Jamie Dimon) do not short Bitcoin, because there is no telling how high it will go. So shorting Bitcoin might be nothing but a gamble, which could turn out to be very expensive.	1
Disclaimer: This article has been updated to include comments from the Pi Network, which claims that no Vietnamese identity cards were held on its servers. Pi Network, a cryptocurrency mining app for mobile users, may have been connected to 17GB worth of personal data leaks, a Vietnamese news outlet reported on Monday. The treasure trove of personal data was apparently taken from the Know Your Customer checks of users of Pi Network, according to the person who posted it to hacker hangout RaidForums on Thursday. The identity cards of an estimated 10,000 Vietnamese citizens were placed for sale, along with connected home addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. The seller placed a price tag of $9,000 on the data, payable in either Bitcoin (BTC) or Litecoin (LTC). Phien Vo, a moderator of a Vietnamese Pi Network group chat channel, told VnExpress that Pi Network���s KYC checks are performed by a third party, adding that Vietnamese identity cards like those in question aren���t compatible with the app. However, Vo did indicate that an older version of the app was compatible with the cards at one point.  ���To perform KYC verification on Pi Network, Vietnamese would need to use their passports. Only some users who used earlier versions of Pi could perform KYC verification using their driver licenses, but so far the system has yet to accept Vietnamese identity cards,��� Vo said. Vietnam���s Ministry of Public Security's cybersecurity division has since launched an investigation into the matter.  An independent investigation into Pi Network���s perceived value was recently conducted by Cem Dilmegani, a tech entrepreneur and founder of AIMultiple. Written weeks prior to the recent data leak, the review concluded that Pi Network bore the hallmarks of a multilevel marketing scheme, or an affiliate marketing program. The Pi app reportedly demands users log in every day and click a button to receive their PI coins. No blockchain consensus algorithm, like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, is used in the app, and users can gain increased mining rates by referring other people. The PI token is not yet traded on exchanges and has no dollar value. The app reportedly sells data for advertising revenue from the moment its usage begins. Given that ad space can sell for a higher value with personal user info included, many have been led to speculate that the Pi app is designed only to siphon personally identifying information from its users.  Cointelegraph reached out to a Pi Network spokesperson for comment. Justin Wu, of Pi Network's marketing and growth team, reiterated that the app's KYC was carried out by a third party, and that no Vietnamese identity cards were held on Pi Network's servers. Wu added that an internal check did not uncover any evidence of a data leak. Wu said Pi Network's referral program was like others in the cryptocurrency space, and is only meant to incentivize the participation of family and friends.	0
The value of Bitcoin may now be compared with that of gold as it���s likely to be heading $25,000 in five years according to Tom Lee, Head Research of Fundstrat Global Advisors and Former Managing Director of JP Morgan Chase. He said it in his recent interview with CNBC���s Fast Money program. Although Bitcoin has suffered from recent negative news from countries like China such as banning of ICOs and planning to shut down the Bitcoin exchanges by the end of the month, Lee thinks there are still advantages to the situation. According to Lee, there are two factors in the issue - liquidity effect and perspective of the people. According to him, Chinese exchanges operate with 30 percent of Bitcoin value. If they decide to shut down the digital currency, obviously there is gonna be force selling. It's safe to point out that there have been seven times already that the crypto world has seen a setback of this magnitude. The second factor is the perspective of the people on Bitcoin. Our society tends to see Bitcoin as a bubble and a fragile currency so everyone should be on the other side of that. ���Well for instance, you know number one Bitcoin is not what people think... We have some data, there's only 300,000 holders of at least $5,000 so think about that that's like saying the iPhone was a bubble in 2007 four days into the sale because there were 500,000 of iPhones. So it's not that many holders of Bitcoin you know when you think about how many wallets there are today that holds $5,000, it���s huge so I think it's still very early stages.��� Bitcoin is different from other technologies, so the actual network itself is generating the value so that the visa of Bitcoin is going to be as valuable as the Blockchain network itself. According to Lee, fraud transaction cannot happen on this digital currency as it will cost $30 bln dollars to create on fake Bitcoin, so it's a very secure trusted network because of the nature of Blockchain. ���I think it can be very threatening to financial institutions to see that hey, trust is created on the network and on the distribution network by the way from generation perspective I think people under the age of 30 think that makes perfect sense.��� Bitcoin is still the best tech framework of today. Just like gold, it is worth investing on. One cannot measure its value in the future with just one look but needs a total analysis on the market. Nevertheless, it still promises a positive, valuable outcome.	1
Nvidia���s RTX 30 series of graphics cards have been subject to unending speculation, rumors and even ridicule since the firm first announced it would ship its latest GPU���s with a built-in Ether (ETH) mining limiter.  A series of missteps saw the mining limiter on Nvidia���s RTX 3060 card first undone by crafty hackers and then completely removed by one of Nvidia���s own driver updates.  The latest in a series of leaks now suggests Nvidia���s next major GPU release ��� the RTX 3080 Ti ��� could be shipped without a cryptocurrency mining limiter at all. Leaked screenshots first uncovered by VideoCardz.com show the 3080 Ti mining Ether with a hash rate of 118.9 megahashes per second ��� that���s more than quadruple what the hamstrung cards were originally supposed to be capable of. It���s worth noting that there has been no confirmation that the GPU in the screenshots is the same one that Nvidia is prepping for release. The leaked model could be a model still around from before the company decided to implement its mining limiters.  Also, Nvidia���s previous missteps in releasing its anti-crypto cards have led to the company considering a complete overhaul of its 30 series range, so the performance of the card in question may not necessarily be representative of the one that is expected to hit shelves in May. With a prospective hash rate of 118.9 MH/s, the RTX 3080 Ti stands to be a very profitable card for Ether miners, even in Western nations. China���s average electricity costs round out at $0.08 per kilowatt-hour per household, meaning the GPU would stand to return profits of around $378 per month, or $4,611 per year. In the United States, where electricity averages at around $0.13/kWh per household, the card would still return healthy profits of $4,488 per year, or just over 2 ETH based on current prices. The GPU is expected to cost around $999 upon release, however, another mad rush by cryptocurrency miners could see demand outstrip supply once more, again resulting in a higher price.	1
After extensive internal testing, Harvest Portfolios has received approval to issue Canada���s first ever Blockchain-based Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), as reported in a press release Feb. 1. The fund (ticker symbol HBLK), set to begin trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange next week, is focused on large and small-scale Blockchain corporations. Harvest Portfolios already has their Harvest Blockchain Technologies Index, designed to track the performance of issuers in both the large-cap and emerging Blockchain segments. The approval is good news for two other firms, First Trust Portfolios Canada and Evolve Funds Group Inc., who have already filed for similar ETFs. First Trust���s ETF manager Karl Cheong said that ���every conversation with clients inevitably��� leads to questions regarding Bitcoin and Blockchain investments. In contrast to the news coming from Canada, US regulators have stated that such funds are not ready for regulation under US law. Dalia Blass, director of the US Securities and Exchange Commission���s (SEC) investment management group said that the SEC has ���significant outstanding questions concerning how funds holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies and related products��� would satisfy legal requirements in the US.	2
Bitcoin (BTC) can rally to $1 million but coronavirus means that the baby boomer generation is ���fucked,��� a damning new macro report concludes. Originally published to clients on March 30, the report from Global Macro Investor dubbed ���The Unfolding��� paints a dismal future for the financial market. According to CEO Raoul Pal, who authored the report, coronavirus has fuelled the fire of systemic weakness across global markets. ���The damage this does to the US pension system is incomprehensible. The Baby Boomers will sell every rally they can to protect their last, rapidly diminishing nest egg,��� he summarized on the market losses from March. The Baby Boomers are totally f*cked. I have been publicly warning and warning about this. Since the point of the report���s publication, a curious phenomenon of stocks��� recovery combined with record unemployment has grown more and more visible. Bitcoin proponents have argued that this represents the intrinsic unfairness of the current fiat economic model ��� big business turns numbers while employees and small businesses are left with nothing. RT host Max Keiser has termed this ���neo-feudalism.��� For Pal, Bitcoin represents a striking exit opportunity from the rapidly deteriorating status quo. Whereas gold could go up five times in the next five years, BTC has much more potential.  Bitcoin vs. gold 3-month chart. Source: Skew ���Bitcoin, well, that���s a different story,��� the report states. I think it can get to $1m in the same period. I think it can go from a $200bn asset class to a $10tn asset class. Pal concluded that Bitcoin ���isn���t just a currency or even a store of value.��� It is an entire trusted, verified, secure, financial and accounting system of value that can never be created outside of the cryptographic algorithm. It is nothing short of the future of our entire medium of exchange system, and of money itself and the platform on which it operates.	2
In the world of cryptocurrencies to date, more than a few millionaires, have been made. In the case of 18-year-old Erik Finman, a $1,000 cash gift from his grandmother turned into over a million dollars after he invested it in Bitcoin back in 2011, at $12 a coin. His early investments in Bitcoin helped him win a bet with his parents -- if he became a millionaire before 18, he could opt out of going to college. Among other accomplishments and ambitious plans, the young millionaire has stated that he plans to launch a satellite ���time capsule��� with NASA to orbit the earth. Finman is still actively involved in the cryptocurrency space. Talking to CNBC this week, Finman insists that he is still passionate about Bitcoin and admits it is always hard to part ways with the valuable virtual currency. "Whenever I sell a little bit of Bitcoin or pay for something in Bitcoin, I multiply that price by ten, because that's where I think that Bitcoin's going. I think it's going to be huge, and I think it's going to be incredible, so I try not to take out any." Following a massive bull run since October, Bitcoin hit the $20,000 mark this weekend. With such significant price growth in a relatively short amount of time, investors looking to get their hands on Bitcoin will have to fork out a lot of money to get a sizeable amount. Nevertheless, Finman says the time is still right to buy the pre-eminent cryptocurrency, recommending giving Bitcoin as a holiday gift: "I think it's a wonderful time to buy Bitcoin. You can actually buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. Buy $100, $50 worth of a Bitcoin. It would be a great stocking stuffer." Finman reiterated his belief that virtual currencies are not just an easy way to get rich - they are at the forefront of a fundamental change in the way people transact and store wealth. "Bitcoin to me, it's not just an investment. It's not just maybe a get rich quick scheme as a lot of people put it. I see it as the future of currency I see it as the future of the financial system."	1
Saxo Bank global macro strategist and famous Bitcoin bull Kay Van-Petersen has said Bitcoin prices will hit ���$50,000 - $100,000 within the next six to 18 months.��� Speaking to Bloomberg in a short interview, Van-Petersen explained that the influx of institutional money would be the ���catalyst��� in pushing Bitcoin prices even further. ���We���ll get a cascade of ETFs, mutual funds and other investment vehicles breaking out,��� he forecast, describing the $100,000 price tag as a ���prudent��� prediction. Not just Bitcoin, but other cryptocurrencies could ���do better��� in terms of price growth from the same phenomenon, the analyst continued, highlighting Ethereum as a possible next contender specifically for ETFs. ���The astonishing thing - mindblowing if you will - is that you take a step back and look at the price appreciation��� a lot of this has happened without traditional institutional money, and that���s basically going to be coming on board over the next six to 18 months,��� Van-Petersen continued. As Bitcoin continues to go well beyond any analyst���s expectations for short-term growth, even the most hardline proponents are being left to wonder what could be next. Even Van-Petersen���s own prediction of a $100,000 Bitcoin within 10 years, which he delivered in May, now seems less surprising. Bitcoin prices have recovered since CBOE���s futures successfully launched, with exchanges currently eyeing $17,000 per coin after a drop below $13,000 over the weekend.	1
Having emerged with the self-applied moniker of ���Dogecoin Killer,��� the latest cryptocurrency to succeed on laughs alone is making its way to Binance.  Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst into CoinMarketCap���s top 20 rankings just two days ago, likely a response by traders to the hype surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE). Within 48 hours, the SHIB token went from a valuation of $0.000003 to $0.000032 ��� a 966% increase, which added to over 2,300,000% growth since the start of the year. When Binance announced it would list SHIB in its innovation zone (a high-risk trading feature) on Monday morning, the token���s valuation more than doubled in the space of two hours, climbing from $0.000013 to $0.000032. The Shiba Inu website claims 50% of the SHIB token supply has been irretrievably locked into Uniswap to provide liquidity. The other 50% has been sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin as a ���burn��� gesture, however, Buterin still has full access to the funds.  The 500 trillion SHIB tokens in Buterin���s public wallet are currently valued at over $15 billion, far exceeding the value of his Ether (ETH) holdings, which are currently worth just over $1.3 billion. It should be noted that Buterin���s wallet regularly receives uninvited donations of such coins, including from numerous other Dogecoin imitators. It seems some of Shiba Inu���s perceived value stems from the notion that Buterin���s tokens will remain untouched, however, not everyone appears to be in agreement. CoinMarketCap attributes an $11-billion market cap valuation to the token, based on a unit price of $0.00002617 and a circulating supply of 394 billion SHIB. CoinGecko has not yet attributed a market cap value to Shiba Inu, as it still hasn���t determined its current coin supply.  Binance, which also owns CoinMarketCap, announced it would open up SHIB for trading in its innovation zone on May 10. The Binance announcement said of Shiba Inu: ���SHIB is the native token of SHIBA INU and will be the first token to be listed and used as an incentive for using ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange,��� it added. The announcement does make note of Buterin���s holdings, highlighting his and two other wallets, warning: ���Please note that, as of the time of writing, the top #1, #2 and #5 wallets hold 50.5%, 7.0% and 3.0% of total supply respectively.��� We reached out to Binance to ask how the presence of half a quadrillion SHIB in Buterin���s wallet affected its market cap calculations. This article will be updated should they reply.	2
Prior to the Bitcoin Gold fork two days ago, the market made some interesting moves. Bitcoin price reached a new all time high on Oct. 20, 2017 - five days before the Bitcoin Gold fork -surpassing $6,000 for the first time and eventually climbing to nearly $6,200. Those of you who have endured past chain splits are aware of what usually happens when there���s a split from the Bitcoin network. Ordinarily, the community complains, reddit.com, medium.com, and twitter.com become platforms for soapbox speeches, and a lot of trash is talked by factions within the community. However, have you noticed the other events that are correlated with a chain split? Once a chain splits, you suddenly own a number of split tokens equivalent to the number of tokens you had on the Bitcoin network. This is because the new chain will be an exact copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain up until the point where the fork occurs. If the wallet you use supports the forked chain���s software, you will be the owner of two digital tokens: Bitcoin and the Forked Chain Token. In our example we will use Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the forked token. When the Bitcoin Cash chain forked off of the main chain, owners of Bitcoin became owners of an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. This is because the chains were identical until the fork occurred. If you owned 10 BTC before the split, then you owned 10 BTC and 10 BCH after the split.  This is where the slope becomes slippery.  People or organizations with unfathomable amounts of money can use forks as an opportunity to extort both the Bitcoin network and the forked network for enticing capital gains when a fork occurs. #CT_questions How important is the impact of #Bitcoin forks on Bitcoin price? Let's say Randy owns 35,000 Bitcoins; at a value of $5,000 per Bitcoin, Randy���s digital assets are worth $175,000,000. Just like anybody with large amounts of money invested in a market, Randy pays attention to news that may affect his position (wealth) in that market. Randy learns that there will be a hardfork in the Bitcoin network and that the hardfork will create a new token, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). On top of this, Randy learns that his Bitcoin wallet provider will support the forked software, so he knows that he will own Bitcoin Cash as well as Bitcoin once the fork occurs. Now, Randy expects to have 35,000 Bitcoin Cash tokens in addition to his 35,000 BTC after the fork.  If Randy was to increase his position by millions of USD worth of Bitcoin, he would be the owner of more Bitcoin than he previously owned. However, he would also create a buy wall that drives the Bitcoin price up since he is such a large player in the Bitcoin market. When Randy increases the amount of Bitcoin he owns, he also increases the amount of Bitcoin Cash he will own once the fork occurs. Because Randy is an educated investor, Randy decides to increase his position in Bitcoin so that he owns 50,000 Bitcoin the day before the fork. Randy did this because he would like to own even more Bitcoin Cash than the 35,000 he would have had if he did not increase his position in Bitcoin. Now when the fork occurs, Randy expects to have 50,000 BCH in addition to his 50,000 BTC. When the Bitcoin Network forks, some of the value that was in the Bitcoin network splits into the forked chain. When Bitcoin Cash forked from the Bitcoin network, the value of Bitcoin went from $2800 to $2700 (July 23,2017). As a result of the fork, Bitcoin Cash was created and was valued around $555 at the time of it���s launch. (July 23, 2017). When Bitcoin dropped from $2,800 to $2,700, Randy's digital assets (wealth in Bitcoin)  dropped from $140,000,000 to $135,000,000, a $5 mln loss. However, because of the fork, Randy now has 50,000 BCH worth $555 a piece. Because Randy is an educated investor and has no plans to use the Bitcoin Cash (BCH), he immediately sells his BCH for a profit the moment the option to sell BCH becomes available to him on his preferred exchange. Randy sells all 50,000 of his BCH for a profit of $27,750,000. A nice $28 mln gain (rounded number) to make up for the $5 mln loss that he suffered due to the decline in the price of Bitcoin. At the end of the day, Randy profits around $23,000,000 from the chain split. Keep in mind, there are other investors like Randy who are highly educated and extremely skilled at what they do. Furthermore, they may be executing a similar or even more efficient strategy as Randy regarding the hardfork; buy a lot of Bitcoin, anticipate a chain split where you are left with a number of new altcoins equivalent to the number of Bitcoin you own, quickly sell off the altcoin for a profit and then decrease your position in Bitcoin because it is overvalued. Individuals like Randy are referred to as whales: individuals who hold positions so large in the Bitcoin market, that their bid and ask orders are capable of shaking up the market. Since it only takes a few big players using a similar strategy to drive the value of Bitcoin up or down, when an opportunity like this presents itself (a hardfork), the price of Bitcoin may not reflect the true value of Bitcoin. Since educated investors know that the Bitcoin price may be artificially high due to big players like themselves implementing a hardfork strategy, the big investor(s) have an incentive to lower their position in Bitcoin once they have executed their hard-fork gameplan. This is because they expect the Bitcoin price to correct to a value that is closer to its true value once all the hard-fork affiliated nonsense subsides. Because there are multiple people like Randy who have a relatively large position in the Bitcoin market, when these people decrease their position in Bitcoin to an amount that they are comfortable owning during a bear period (and that number may be zero) their collective ask offers are capable of creating a sell-wall that drives down the price of Bitcoin. After the big sell off of both the altcoin - because investors find it virtually worthless for them to hold for the long term - and Bitcoin - because investors know the price is artificially high for the short term due to their market strategy - investors capitalize on the low price of Bitcoin from the massive sell-wall and they buy back the Bitcoin that they previously unloaded. On top of the profit investors make from selling-off all of their altcoin, investors will experience capital gains from selling their Bitcoin at an artificially high price and then purchasing Bitcoin back once the price is lower. During the period where investors buy back Bitcoin, we tend to see the price stabilize for a short period of time. Investors may have stockpiled Bitcoin anticipating an equal amount of altcoin and then sold off a significant amount of both Bitcoin and altcoin - in our example Bitcoin Cash - to reap the massive capital gains available to them. I can���t rule out the possibility that several other market factors had an effect on the Bitcoin price surge and subsequent plummet, but that being said, how plausible do you think it is that the whales set off the surge and fall of Bitcoin?	1
Blockchain-based payments gateway Ripple announced a new partnership with payment service MoneyGram today, Jan. 11. In a blog post today, Ripple confirmed that MoneyGram would integrate Ripple���s XRP altcoin into its payment system. The integration, according to Ripple, ���allows MoneyGram to solve the age-old liquidity issue most financial institutions face.��� Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented in company���s blog post announcing the partnership: ���The payments problem doesn���t just affect banks; it also affects companies like MoneyGram, which help people get money to the ones they care about. By using a digital asset like XRP that settles in three seconds or less, our clients can move money as quickly as information.��� Garlinghouse has increasingly championed XRP���s perceived advantages as a currency over Bitcoin as interest and trade increased. Given Ripple���s market value in early January, the company���s chairman, Chris Larsen, was then reported to have accrued personal wealth to rival Warren Buffett and Bill Gates due to his 37 percent stake. Ripple has unveiled several partnership deals in recent weeks, and in the first week of 2018, the value of XRP skyrocketed to highs barely imaginable just months ago. While the rate of appreciation drew no shortage of warnings and criticism, the refusal of Coinbase to add the altcoin reportedly precipitated a 30 percent downturn last week, something the latest news appears to be changing. XRP is up almost eight percent in the 24 hours to press time according to data from CoinMarketCap, which since Jan. 8 does not include some major South Korean markets.	1
Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin finally got its long-awaited shoutout on Saturday Night Live ��� but despite hodler hopes, the immediate result has been a violent dump. First teased by entrepreneur and DOGE cheerleader Elon Musk in late April, the Tesla CEO finally mentioned the digital asset on live television tonight in his opening monologue of the sketch comedy show. The reference was a throwaway line from Musk's mother, who joined him onstage and asked if her Mother's Day gift would be Dogecoin; Musk replied that it would be.  In the minutes afterwards, $DOGE dumped upwards of 25%, falling as low as $.50 from $.66 highs at the start of the show. It has since partially recovered, trading at $.52 at the time of publication. The DogefatherSNL May 8 An hour before the episode began, the price of DOGE sat at $.66, down from an all-time high of $.72. A pair of bearish headwinds may have shared responsibility for the pullback: Musk himself seemed to try and get ahead of the hype, urging followers in a Tweet to ���invest with caution,��� and a host of new data indicates that many investors may be rolling their DOGE profits into other, largecap digital assets.  Cryptocurrency is promising, but please invest with caution! https://t.co/A4kplcP8Vq Additionally, Barry Silbert ��� the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of crypto investment vehicle company Grayscale ��� announced a public short on DOGE via the FTX exchange. In a series of follow-up Tweets, he revealed that the position was $1 million in size, and that any proceeds or remaining funds after closing the short would be donated to charity.  Okay $DOGE peeps, it's been fun. Welcome to crypto!But the time has come for you to convert your DOGE to BTC[disclosure: we've gone short DOGE via https://t.co/s8Qde2Ub4Z] (It���s unclear if Silbert was is using ���we��� in reference to Digital Currency Group, one of its portfolio companies, or is simply and bizarrely using a plural pronoun in reference to himself).  Many DOGE investors were nonetheless holding out hope for a high-profile shoutout on what looked to be a major pop culture event. NBC, the studio behind SNL, chose for the first time ever to live-stream the episode on Youtube, per the Wall Street Journal.  Even a mention could have significant impact on the price of DOGE as well: the meme currency has proven to be susceptible to price movements based on positive social media volume, and multiple studies have shown that Tweets from Musk often lead to price appreciation. A mention on an even bigger platform was thought to potentially lead to even greater gains.  Leading into the premier of the episode, Alameda Research trader Sam Trabucco (who said in a previous Tweet that he was ���studying the typical SNL episode structure to try and understand when a DOGE mention would be the most natural���) speculated that if a joke or mention didn���t come in Musk���s opening monologue, it would be ���all over.��� My instinct is if it���s not in his monologue it���s all over. Despite arriving during the monologue, traders nonetheless responded negatively. It remains to be seen if a DOGE-centric skit later in the show can perhaps turn the speculative asset's fortunes around.	1
While the spotlight has been on Bitcoin due to its record-breaking all-time highs, other cryptocurrencies are also on the rise. Though many investors have lost the opportunity to earn millions from Bitcoin, other opportunities are rising up in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most notable ones is Ethereum.   The cryptocurrency community was left stunned by the recent meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin.   Ethereum is now moving into the spotlight due to its sharp growth of 13,633 percent since 2015 - a record that not many financial mediums have seen in a long time. In fact, experts expect Ethereum price to go even higher than it currently is.   With all the spotlight shifting focus, Ethereum has been constantly trying to improve their system to further cater to investors.   The Ethereum platform aims for zero downtime and strong security. With the system features alone, Ethereum already holds the upper hand on Bitcoin. With its fast transaction rates, Ethereum has moved further ahead of Bitcoin.   Aside from Ethereum, there are other cryptocurrencies that hold even bigger potential for earning, due to their lower price.   While Bitcoin and Ethereum are continuously growing, they will eventually reach a point wherein investors won���t receive much profit anymore because they will have reached their peak value. However, the younger and newer cryptocurrencies are still at a low base, which means that they have the potential for future growth.   The third highest in value after Bitcoin and Ethereum is Ripple, which has a price of $0.33 and is expected to grow.   Ripple is predicted to have a one-year return of 5,478 percent, following the trend of other digital tokens. Following after is New Economic Movement (NEM), which is priced at $0.257 and expected to have a one-year return of 14,998 percent.   Another digital token that is being targeted by investors is Bytecoin, which is currently priced at $0.00395 and expected to have a one-year return of 9,785 percent.   All figures were taken from a report by CoinMarketCap.   These are only a few of the smaller players that are making their way to the heights of Bitcoin. However, among all of the digital tokens that are found in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum is seen as the biggest winner after Bitcoin and seems to be making its way to all-time highs in 2017.	1
In a statement released to customers on Tuesday, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange eToro announced it would delist Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) for United States customers by the end of the year. After Dec. 31, U.S. users will no longer be able to open new positions in the tokens nor stake ADA and TRX. In addition, wallets will be effectively in withdraw-only mode until the first quarter of 2022, when selling will also become limited. In making the decision, eToro cited regulatory concerns surrounding both assets. The move came as a surprise to some as ADA has not been traditionally associated with regulatory troubles. In context, tokens like Ripple (XRP), whose creators are currently engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, as well as Monero, which is a privacy coin that some fear is easily abused for illicit purposes, are facing the brunt of regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency industry. ADA experienced a rapid price increase this year and currently ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. During the prior quarter, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano's founder, announced a partnership with blockchain analytics provider Confirm to comply with regulatory frameworks, such as anti-money laundering directives. The move was panned by some ADA supporters, who wanted the project to take on a more decentralized nature. Firms operating in the blockchain industry often receive intense pressure from regulators when it comes to delisting coins or pulling the plug on certain services. In Sept., Coinbase abandoned its crypto lending platform plans after the SEC threatened to sue the company. For now, however, the rise of decentralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols have provided popular alternatives for those looking to legally bypass such crackdowns.	1
Chinese Bitcoin and Blockchain Angel Investor Chandler Guo has announced he will release his own Bitcoin hard fork - called Bitcoin God (GOD). In a tweet sounding not unlike a parody of recent fork announcements in Bitcoin, Guo said his chain would fork off from Core Dec. 25, ���to be symbolic of me giving candy to all Bitcoin Holders.��� When asked whether the idea was a joke, Guo confirmed it was ���real.��� ���The total amount will be 21 mln. No pre-mine,��� he added. Bitcoin God (GOD) will be forked off the main bitcoin chain at the block height of 501225, which will happen on December 25h to be symbolic of me giving candy to all Bitcoin Holders. The total amount will be 21 million. No pre-mine. pic.twitter.com/4T2lwojYTr December has suddenly become the month of forks for Bitcoin, with at least three set to take their network snapshots before the end of the year. Bitcoin Diamond, which is currently pre-launch, could also come into effect within the same period, the fork���s futures already listed on Coinmarketcap and trading at around $45. A key aspect of new ���versions��� of Bitcoin is its appeal to investors looking to obtain ���free money��� - duplicate balances of their respective BTC holdings at the time of each snapshot. This is no doubt the mindset behind December���s Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin Platinum and Bitcoin Cash Plus schemes, with the first of these already confirming it will award equivalent balances to those with BTC. Guo is meanwhile yet to release further details of Bitcoin God, having made the initial announcement via WeChat.	1
Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange currently ranked second to OKEx on CoinMarketCap in trading volume, has temporarily suspended withdrawals and trading. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, tweeted on Feb. 7 at 6:38pm EST that the exchange was experiencing a server error that could be resolved in a few hours and that ���no data is lost.��� We experienced a server issue on our replica database cluster, causing some data to be out of sync. Need to fully resync from master. Due the size of the data, it will take several hours. No data is lost. We appreciate your understanding and support. About two hours later, Zhao tweeted that the new estimate for resolving the out of sync data was 10 hours. A separate tweet shortly after apologized to Binance customers for the system���s extended and unexpected downtime: sorry guys, not something we want either. We didn't have a choice, other than trying to fix it as soon as possible for our users. One of our team literally threw up after the calculation arrived at 10 hours. https://t.co/P2YjkYDf9K Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken had experienced similar unexpected downtime in January, when a scheduled two-hour long system upgrade turned into a more than two day delay until the exchange went back online. According to Binance���s official Twitter, trading activity is estimated to resume on Feb. 9 at 4am (UTC) (11:00pm EST). Customers will have 30 minutes before trading starts to withdraw orders. Zhao has denied that any hack on Binance has taken place: All because this didn���t do what it was suppose to do. Not hack. pic.twitter.com/gHW9fxaAQN Binance had seen a such large influx of new customers, adding 250,000 thousand in one day on Jan. 4 and 240,000 users in one hour on Jan. 13, that they temporarily suspended new user sign ups in early January. Exchanges Bittrex and Bitfinex have also stopped new users sign ups for the same reason. Binance had been the world���s largest crypto exchange in mid-January, at one point hosting trading of almost $5 bln over a 24-hour period. OKEx now holds the number one spot for trading volume on CoinMarketCap, about $3.5 bln over a 24-hour period by press time, with Binance���s trading volume at about $2.1 bln over a 24-hour period by press time.	2
The highly anticipated launch of Bitcoin futures on the CBOE exchange was as fortuitous as one could expect in the world of cryptocurrencies, as the trading platform crashed in the first hour of being open. Having scoffed at cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to meet the massive influx of people trying to enter the market over the past two weeks, mainstream financial institutions caught a glimpse of the behemoth that Bitcoin has become. Nevertheless, Bitcoin futures have officially been launched and their reality has seen the market react positively. Social media platforms were understandably busy - and people from all walks of life were giving their two cents worth in reaction to the newly launch futures. Renowned stock picker Ronnie Moas reflected back on the launch of Amazon back in 1997 and how it has grown and survived the notorious dot.com bubble.

After inadvertently advertising Bitcoin (BTC) last week, United States President Donald Trump has now hinted that he expects oil to crash to just $9. In a press conference on March 31, Trump reiterated what has become a penchant for lower oil prices.  He was speaking amid talks with both Russia and Saudi Arabia, both of which plan to increase oil production this month despite the plunge in demand caused by coronavirus. WTI crude prices have lost more than 50% in the past 30 days alone.  ���Look, it���s $22, but it���s really much cheaper than that if you want to negotiate ��� nobody���s seen that,��� Trump told the press. ���That���s like from the 1950s, it really is ��� to think that it was $50, $60, $70, $80 ��� and now it���s $22, but you know, if you put a good bid in at $9, I think you could probably get what you wanted, right?��� The last time that oil circled $10 was in 1998 when Saudi Arabia likewise flooded the market to ward off an advance by Venezuela.  As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has limited its year-to-date losses to around 10%, whereas WTI has shed almost 70%, according to data from monitoring resource Skew.  Macro assets returns for 2020. Source: Skew Trump���s comments were particularly poignant coming on the back of the turmoil facing both the U.S. dollar and its issuer, the Federal Reserve.  After the Fed said that it had ���unlimited��� money, Trump claimed that the state could manipulate infinitely, describing it as ���our money��� and ���our currency.��� This, in turn, sent shivers down the spine of Bitcoin supporters, as the lack of such meddling in the money supply is a key benefit over fiat which makes the cryptocurrency a form of ���hard��� money. The planned production boost in April is especially notable for Russia���s fiat currency, the ruble, and those who use it. Heavily tied to oil prices, the ruble has plunged to its lowest level against the dollar in four years. Paradoxically, Russia currently spends money propping up the ruble���s exchange rate while also producing oil for a saturated market.	1
Saturday, Nov. 17: crypto markets have seen another mild decline, with losses across the top 20 coins by market cap reaching 4 percent over the past 24 hours. In contrast, Ripple (XRP), which is still holding strong as the second coin by market cap, continues to see sufficient gains as of press time, according to data from Coin360.  Market visualization from Coin360 After seeing a small rebound yesterday, the largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is very slightly down over the past 24 hours. As of press time, Bitcoin is down less than 1 percent on the day and trading at $5,560. The major cryptocurrency has seen some volatility during the day, with its price declining to as low as $5,490, while its intraday high reached $,5,616. According to Bloomberg's research arm Bloomberg Intelligence, the cryptocurrency market ���drama��� is ���just starting,��� with analysts predicting that Bitcoin���s price would take a further dip to as low as $1,500. Such a decline would mean a 70 percent drop from current market levels, while Bitcoin has already lost more than 60 percent of its value over the year.  Bitcoin 7-day price chart.

Ripple is also the leader in terms of daily performance, with its price up almost 6 percent to trade around $0.49 at press time.

Source: CoinMarketCap Recently, CoinShares CSO Meltem Demirors argued that one of the reasons the market has been seeing volatility this week was that institutions are ���taking money off the table��� in anticipation of Bitcoin Cash���s  (BCH) recent hard fork. Other industry experts agreed that the fork is causing uncertainty in the markets. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork took place on Nov. 15, the day after crypto markets have suffered a notable decline. The update of the BCH network has caused multiple suspensions of Bitcoin Cash trading and withdrawals across global exchanges. The protocol upgrade has divided Bitcoin Cash supporters into two groups who disagree about how the network should be updated ��� Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. According to BCH community-backed statistics website Coin.Dance, Bitcoin ABC is currently slightly ahead of SV in terms of hashrate and proof of work by press time. Bitcoin Cash is seeing some of the largest losses across top 20 coins at press time, down 4.29 percent, and trading around $385 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap. In a note to clients yesterday, Nov. 16, Wall Street analyst and cryptocurrency bull Tom Lee cut his end-year Bitcoin price target nearly in half, lowering it from $25,000 to $15,000.	1
While cryptocurrencies have been a talking point at previous World Economic Forum conferences, they have come to the fore in Davos this year. Following a breakout year which saw Bitcoin rise to an almighty high of $20,000, alongside the massive growth of other altcoins, it���s hardly surprising that one of the major talking points at WEF would be the future of cryptocurrency. With financial industry leaders coming together at the most important annual event on the economic calendar, media outlets took their chance to ask the top minds for their two cents worth on the current and future prospects of virtual currencies. Cointelegraph is currently attending the summit in Davos and has reported continual resistant perceptions towards cryptocurrencies. These views stem from a lack of a regulatory framework for virtual currencies which has made some of the world���s prominent banking and financial institutions hesitant about investing and supporting cryptocurrencies. UBS Chairman Axel Weber said as much in an interview with Bloomberg, saying his firm would not recommend cryptocurrency adoption or investment to its clients until there is clarity on future regulatory action. As per usual, the vibrant and feisty cryptocurrency community has been watching developments at Davos keenly, and there has been plenty of backlash in response to any FUD or untoward comments about cryptocurrencies. Full Tilt Capital Partner Anthony Pompliano was scathing in his analysis of the prevailing sentiment floating around in Davos towards Bitcoin. The former Facebook product and growth manager suggested that statements made by economist Joseph Stiglitz that Bitcoin was still used for shady purposes actually has the opposite effect of driving people away from cryptocurrency adoption. Joseph Stiglitz, well-known economist, is bragging to the Davos crowd that Bitcoin is used for "secret use cases" & that fiat currency is superior. My theory is that this type of fear-mongering actually drives more adoption of Bitcoin & cryptocurrencies.https://t.co/zhy5hB486Y Max Keiser, host of the Keiser Report on RT, also touched on the wave of negativity around Bitcoin in Davos, but said it was too late for big financial industry players to try to stop what he described as a ���revolution.��� Those at Davos threatened by #Bitcoin maybe could have thwarted the revolution 5 yrs ago. But now it���s too late. Go home guys, your time is over. https://t.co/SMoDw8DSxu Renowned American investor Bill Gross suggested that the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has signaled a move away from centralized institutions governing and controlling money. People seem to be putting their trust in technology over government-run establishments. Bitcoin���s rise may reflect, for better or worse, a monumental transfer of social trust: away from human institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on well-tested computer code.. #WEF18 https://t.co/6hWKq6Lo6U #Davos pic.twitter.com/Ltuh6owdzm Twitter users CryptoWilson highlighted more negative sentiment towards cryptocurrency, sharing a video of French President Emmanuel Macron speaking in favor of regulatory crackdowns by the International Monetary Fund on cryptocurrency. Macron 'triggered by Bitcoin' at Davos: "I am in favor of the IMF having full competence over the whole areas that escape regulation: bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, shadow banking [...] which can trigger crises." https://t.co/XZ1Vyj0tB4 Setting perceptions of sentiment aside, the truth of the matter is that the financial world can no longer turn a blind eye on cryptocurrencies. They are very much a central point of this year���s WEF and understandably so. As the 68th US Secretary of State John Kerry told Cointelegraph earlier this week at the summit, the sheer value of capital that has been poured into the overall cryptocurrency market has made it impossible to ignore. Coinmarketcap currently has the current total market capitalization at $559 bln- a steady number after a month of wild market volatility.	0
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a plan on Monday for the first hard fork of the new Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, tentatively named HF1. The hard fork would allow the developers to introduce several key upgrades to the recently launched Beacon Chain, which would also serve as a useful test for deeper changes in the future.  The biggest practical change is the support for light clients ��� nodes that would have minimal resource requirements and could run on mobile devices. This would allow for ���trust-minimized wallets��� that are able to verify the blockchain on their own instead of relying on external service providers. Light client support is introduced through special-purpose ���sync committees,��� groups of validators that are randomly assigned to create special signatures that make it easier to determine the correct version of the chain. Other improvements include fixes to fork choice rules, where developers identified several instances of the protocol being potentially vulnerable to reorganization attacks. The issues are subtle and require precise timing, but they could have allowed malicious actors to exploit the network while controlling a small portion of validators. These weaknesses were known before launch but were discovered too late to be fixed in time, Buterin wrote. In terms of practical changes, the hard fork aims to overhaul how the slashing and inactivity leakage mechanics work. Currently, stakers on Eth2 may lose a portion of their capital either due to being inactive or by attempting to support a minority fork of the chain, which is punished with slashing. Inactivity leakage was sometimes considered a deterrent to home staking, due to being penalized for force majeure issues like a patchy internet connection or blackouts. While the system was set up to be very lenient, the team is now further tweaking the mechanism to make life simpler for stakers with unstable connections. The leak is set to become quadratic, meaning that there will be a significant difference between intermittent and continuous inactivity. For a rough example of the magnitude, a staker who experienced 10 outages for a six minutes each, totaling one hour, would lose 10 times less than another staker who simply disconnected their machine for one continuous hour.  Inactivity leaks will also end gradually instead of immediately, which ensures that offline nodes will keep losing value until the network is well above the necessary threshold for security.  While some of the changes make the system more lenient for honest mistakes, the team is changing some parameters to introduce harsher monetary penalties for bad behavior. This is aimed to ���weaken the training wheels��� of the system. It is unclear when the hard fork will be performed, with development and review still required for some of the details of the proposal. In the meantime, the Ethereum developers are trying to come up with a naming convention for HF1 and future hard forks. Proposed themes so far include names of stars, planetary systems, World of Warcraft zones and months of the year, among others.	1
There is a growing trend of Blockchain implementation in the social media industry. This development is changing how the public approaches an ecosystem which has before now been at the mercy of a few individuals in terms of security, commerce, functionality and general control. The significance of social media to everyday life keeps growing with each passing day. In the areas of education, politics, e-commerce and even relationships, the social environment built upon cyberspace is continually proving its relevance as a tool for effective communication between individuals and groups across different parts of the world. The emergence of Blockchain technology brings a revolution to this industry which is already visible in the areas of improved reliability and earning opportunities. Derin Cag, founder of Richtopia says: ���With the rise of Blockchain technology, socio-economic transactions are improving and becoming more democratic as we shift from the Internet of information to the Internet of value.��� According to Cag, there are numerous benefits of having Blockchain technology frameworks within social media platforms. One major problem that exists within the social media ecosystem and cyberspace, in general, is the significant lack of privacy and indiscriminate sharing of personal data across major social media platforms. It may not be particularly accurate to assume that these platforms make use of the data of individuals without their permission because almost every single one of these platforms have a ���Terms and Conditions��� documents which most users agree to without even reading a single line of the usually extremely long document. Most of the time, the ambiguous statements within these documents empowers the platform owners and administrators to exercise the level of control that we see today. However, this extensive control by the centralized platform owners does not only enable the indiscriminate exposure of users, but it also shuts them out from any possible benefits that they could achieve by the use of their personal data and identity. These are some of the problems that are already being addressed by Blockchain implementation in social media. Abhishek Bhandari, co-founder and VP of Bloomatch tells Cointelegraph that Blockchain is revolutionizing each and every industry at the moment. He notes that the major attraction of various sectors towards Blockchain is the basics of Blockchain for maintaining data on multiple and decentralized nodes. ���I assume in next five years most of the platforms in digital space would use Blockchain.��� Bhandari affirms that Social Media has become a very important and indispensable part of human existence and Blockchain technology would give a sense of protection and satisfaction to all users. He explains that current social media platforms have many drawbacks in terms of data security and cyber crimes, problems which he is certain that Blockchain technology will eventually address effectively Dor Konforty, CEO of Synereo elaborates that the primary purpose of the marketing, content, and features of Facebook, YouTube and most other modern media platforms is to increase the number of hours each user engages with the platform, to the point where it may disrupt their lives, so that they can capture and sell more of their attention as well as information about their behavior. However, Konforty explains that without a centralized entity profiting from this, and with value generated flowing directly to users through intermediary-less interactions, new platforms will adapt their business models to rely on added-on services rather than on practices which have already been proven to be harmful to the health of their userbases. Konforty also notes the complexity of monetization on social media: ���Monetization is another deep trouble; creators of original content are in a position where the method they chose for publishing their creations defines their method of monetization, if existent. While YouTube shares some of their proceeds with creators, Facebook, Twitter and the like don't do even that.��� Ultimately, without intermediaries shaping the discourse and being in full control of the available content, all geared towards their bottom lines, the space of possible social and economic interactions will expand greatly, benefiting all involved. Likewise, without huge datastores immediately available to centralized entities, dystopian scenarios such as allocating scores to citizens based on their online activity and adherence to the mandated way of living may be averted. This is the promise of the Blockchain.	2
Ripple Chairman and Co-founder Chris Larsen has profited so much from the asset���s bull run he could be the world���s richest person. That���s according to BitFury CEO George Kikvadze, whose made a tweet about Larsen���s likely huge personal wealth gains over the past year. ���At Ripple's Implied Market Value of $320 bln - Chris Larsen with his 37 percent stake has become the world's richest person bypassing (Bill Gates) & (Warren Buffett),��� Kikvadze noted Wednesday. BREAKING: At RIPPLE'S Implied Market Value of $320Bln - Chris Larsen with his 37% stake has become the world's richest person bypassing @BillGates & @WarrenBuffett !!! @CNBC @business @Forbes CONGRATS CHRIS ! Ripple���s XRP token has delighted investors into 2018 with gains of over 35,000 percent, much of that taking place in the last few months. Shooting up to highs above $3.60 per token, only Coinbase���s announcement that it had ���no plans��� to add new assets, including XRP, was able to take prices down somewhat. On the topic of Larsen meanwhile, Forbes gave a more conservative outlook, nonetheless placing the co-founder���s wealth at up to $59 bln. ���That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world���s richest people,��� the New York Times commented on the data. Zuckerberg had coincidentally hinted at plans to integrate cryptocurrency with unnamed Facebook ���services��� this week, announcing in a post that he was ���interested in going deeper and studying the positive and negative aspects of [technologies like encryption and cryptocurrencies], and how best to use them.���	1
Security researchers have identified a new trend of lucrative and illicit conversions from Bitcoin (BTC) to cash in their analysis of dozens of dark web marketplaces and forums. Financial scammers are selling cold, hard cash for only 10 to 12 cents on the dollar to buyers willing to provide a prepaid fee in Bitcoin, according to the new Q3 2019 Black Market Report from Armor���s Threat Resistance Unit. The money laundering scheme sees cybercriminals offer up bundles of cash ��� typically from $2,500 to $10,000 ��� in exchange for a 10% to 12% fee payable in Bitcoin.  Once the buyer has transferred the cryptocurrency, they provide details of the bank, PayPal or Western Union account where the money should be sent.  As an extremely simple, turn-key service, this arrangement offers buyers sky-high returns on their illicit purchase and removes the need for a money mule or the risk of logging into compromised accounts.  As the report outlines, money mules are agents who transfer ill-gotten funds between accounts in exchange for a fee of 10% to 20% of the value. Such actors typically open costly business bank accounts in order to avoid triggering fraud alerts or drawing unwanted attention when transacting large volumes.  Notably, this conversion scheme benefits those selling the stolen funds because they avoid taking possession of the funds and instead merely transfer them ��� meaning the buyer carries the risk. Chris Hinkley, head of Armor���s Threat Resistance Unit, said: "For those scammers who don���t possess the technical skills and a robust money mule network to monetize online bank account or credit card credentials, this is an offer that can be very attractive [...]. This clever service gives them an additional channel for monetizing the large amounts of financial data available on the underground." As previously reported, United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently claimed that cash is not laundered to the same extent as Bitcoin, declaring that the government was intent on preventing the cryptocurrency from becoming the ���equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.���  Reporters responded with some skepticism to Mnuchin���s stance, quipping in response that his argument was essentially ��� and somewhat illogically ��� that: ������The existing system has never been used for illicit activities but we're going to make sure crypto isn't used for illicit activities like the current system. Got it.���	1
Crypto analyst and host of CNBC���s show Cryptotrader Ran Neuner has claimed that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is ���about to explode��� in a recent tweet October 7. Neuner expressed his utmost confidence in an upcoming surge in Bitcoin���s price by noting ���I just bought Bitcoin for my parents��� in the same tweet. A notable rally would likely be tied to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission���s (SEC) highly-anticipated upcoming decision on several Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applications, the trader claimed in another tweet posted the same day. Explaining his optimistic prediction, the crypto analyst pointed to the fact that the leading cryptocurrency���s rally last year from ���$6,691 (Nov 11) to $20,000 (Dec 17)��� was, according to him, ���on the back of  the expectation and launch of a cash settlement BTC futures contract.��� Following confirmation from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) were eligible to launch Bitcoin futures, CBOE was the first to launch Bitcoin futures on December 11, while CME launched soon after on December 17 ��� the day Bitcoin has hit its historic high of $20,000. Pointing at Bitcoin futures, Neuner made a parallel with the SEC���s much-anticipated decision on the first Bitcoin ETFs to be approved by the regulator. The analyst claimed that a Bitcoin ETF is a ���way bigger deal��� than a cash settlement Bitcoin futures contract, since it ���requires actual purchase of BTC.��� Many point to a Bitcoin ETF helping Bitcoin reach more mainstream investors, since they would not have to directly invest in the underlying asset, in this case the cryptocurrency. If listed on a regulated U.S. exchange, a Bitcoin ETF could potentially push Bitcoin toward broader recognition on Wall Street. While the SEC have recently scheduled their deadline of November 5 for reviewing nine Bitcoin ETF applications from three different applicants, the actual effects of an approved Bitcoin ETF���s launch on crypto markets is up for debate. In late July this year, the SEC rejected the application for a Bitcoin ETF from brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss for the second time, following previous rejection in March 2017. Shortly after the rejection, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce made a statement of official dissent from the agency���s disapproval of the Winklevoss fund appeal. Peirce suggested that the disapproval order will likely ���inhibit��� the institutionalization of the BTC market.	2
Financial institutions aren't shy of experimenting and structuring new products. Fisco, a Japanese-based financial information provider, has issued debt denominated in Bitcoins. Japan has been at the forefront of regulating Bitcoin, with the government legalizing Bitcoins as a form of payment early this year. Regulators have also exempted Bitcoin from sales tax, increasing the volume of Bitcoin trades and at one point making Japan the largest Bitcoin market. It comes as no surprise that a Japanese company, Fisco, has taken the lead in experimenting with Bitcoin bonds. As per a Bloomberg report, Fisco has issued a three year debt of 200 Bitcoins to another group firm. The bond has a three percent interest rate. The company aims to arrange cryptocurrency debt for its clients if the Bitcoin market develops. While Wall Street has taken an interest in cryptocurrencies, there haven't been too many Bitcoin-denominated financial products so far. The efforts of the Winklevoss twins and others to start a Bitcoin ETF has remained stuck in regulatory red tape. In the opinion of a substantial majority of people, the outlook for Bitcoin in the long term is positive. Bitcoin, although a risky asset, is expected to grow by leaps and bounds in the medium term. In such a scenario, issuing bonds denominated in Bitcoin might be a recipe for disaster. One million dollars borrowed in mid-July could turn into debt of two million dollars in mid-August. Ordinary businesses, whose core competency is not Bitcoin trading, cannot afford to take this substantial risk. Bitcoin-denominated loans could make sense to two types of companies. One, if the company is a Bitcoin trader who wants to take a short position in Bitcoin. The other are companies whose earnings are denominated in Bitcoin (such as Bitcoin mining companies) who stand to benefit from Bitcoin price appreciation and can afford to pay back debt denominated in Bitcoin. For ordinary companies, issuing Bitcoin-denominated debt is foolhardy.	2
The crypto markets have seen a slight uptick Tuesday, Feb. 6, after Monday���s sharp decline. This slight market rebound could be attributed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) hearings that are taking place today, Feb. 6. The regulatory bodies plan to discuss cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), and ETFs. Bitcoin (BTC) is still trading around the $7000 mark, about $7,171.42 by press time and up 1.28 percent over a 24-hour period. This is almost $1000 up from a low today that had brought BTC to almost $6,000.  Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have gone up 4.59 and 1.65 percent over a 24-hour period respectively, trading at around $732.13 and $0.70. Total crypto market cap is about $339 bln, up from an early morning low of around $276 bln.  Altcoins NEO and NEM were markedly up compared to the rest of the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap, up almost 12 percent each over a 24-hour period and trading at $91.40 and $0.51 by press time.	2
After settling charges of improper reporting of exchange volume and ���self-trading��� with the Community Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, on Friday, reports have emerged that cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase is set to push back its stock listing to next month. The company had previously been expected to go public some time in March.  On Friday, the CFTC announced a settlement with Coinbase over charges that the company inaccurately reported trading data on Bitcoin (BTC), and that an employee ���self-traded��� to create the illusion of volume and demand for Litecoin (LTC). ���Reporting false, misleading, or inaccurate transaction information undermines the integrity of digital asset pricing,��� said Acting Director of Enforcement Vincent McGonagle. ���This enforcement action sends the message that the Commission will act to safeguard the integrity and transparency of such information.��� The CFTC order says that between January 2015 and September 2018, the company operated two automated trading programs, Hedger and Replicator. While the exchange disclosed the use of a trading program, it did not reveal that it was using the two that often matched trades.  As a result, the Coinbase API delivered fraudulent trading data to entities such as: the CME Bitcoin Real Time Index and CoinMarketCap, as well as the NYSE Bitcoin Index via ���direct transmission��� from Coinbase.  The CFTC noted that this falsified data ���potentially resulted in a perceived volume and level of liquidity of digital assets, including Bitcoin, that was false, misleading, or inaccurate.��� Additionally, the announcement notes that an employee intentionally placed matching LTC/BTC trades during a six-week period in 2016 to create the illusion of liquidity and demand for LTC. The CFTC found Coinbase ���vicariously liable��� for these fraudulent trades.  The total penalty for these charges is $6.5 million.  Following the settlement with the CFTC, a report from Bloomberg says that the exchange has delayed its direct stock listing to next month.  Citing ���people familiar with the matter,��� Bloomberg said that the plans for a March stock offering on American exchanges has ���slipped,��� and no further details were provided. Earlier this month, Bloomberg cited anonymous sources to report that Justin Sun had won the nearly $70 million Christie���s auction for a Beeple nonfungible token, which was later proved to be false, and that Binance was under investigation by the CFTC for allowing U.S. residents to place illegal trades. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao vigorously denied the characterization of the report.	2
Bitcoin (BTC) is going to hit a giant $400,000, celebrated TV host Max Keiser has said as he raises his price target for the first time since 2012. Speaking on news information show Infowars on Feb. 17, Keiser told host Alex Jones that his old prediction of $100,000 was now too conservative. He told the show: ���I am officially raising my target for Bitcoin ��� and I first made this prediction when it was $1, I said this could go to $100,000 ��� I���m raising my official target for the first time in eight years, I���m raising it to $400,000.��� Keiser was speaking as coronavirus continued to overshadow global markets and Bitcoin traded lower on the day at below $10,000.  Unfazed by short-term volatility, he said the largest cryptocurrency was ���equally as attractive��� at current levels as it was at the time of his original forecast. ���The good news��� is that Bitcoin at $10,000 or $9,300 is equally as attractive as it was when it was $100,��� he explained. While he did not name a specific timeframe, 40x returns would make Keiser more bullish than the majority of even the best-known Bitcoin supporters. Even venture capitalist Tim Draper believes that, at least by 2024, BTC/USD should make it to a more modest $250,000. John McAfee, who became infamous for pledging to ingest his own penis if Bitcoin did not crack $1 million by 2021, subsequently withdrew from his bet. Bobby Lee, CEO of Bitcoin wallet Ballet, believes $500,000 is a likely price for 2028. Meanwhile, one historically accurate technical indicator has calculated an average price of $100,000 for the period between 2021 and 2024.	2
Bitcoin prices fell to three-week lows of around $8,540 on May 11, as markets reacted to a flash investigation of South Korean exchange Upbit and a fresh Mt.Gox funds liquidation. Data from Cointelegraph���s price tracker and Coin360 shows BTC/USD dipping sharply over the past 24 hours, with major altcoin assets posting considerably higher losses of up to 18 percent. Traders appeared to deliver a knee-jerk reaction to news that Upbit, Korea���s largest cryptocurrency exchange and a subsidiary of communications giant Kakao, had received a visit from the country���s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC). According to local media, authorities suspect Upbit had ���deceived customers��� by providing false information about its balance sheets. At the same time, executives in charge of refunding users of former Japanese exchange Mt.Gox have evidently sold a new chunk of about 8,000 BTC (about $70 mln at press time) in four batches of 2,000 BTC. Such actions in the past had reportedly affected global prices several times since November. As of press time Friday, Bitcoin had lost around $800, or 8.5 percent, in the past 24 hours, hitting the lowest price the coin has seen since April 20. Across altcoin markets, Ethereum (ETH) posted near 12 percent losses, while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fared worse, both losing about 17 percent over the same period.  Market visualization from Coin360 While some local sources took to social media to suggest the price dip was an ���overreaction��� on the part of cryptocurrency holders, the episode is a test for Korean exchanges, which only recently returned to the listings of popular price tracker resource CoinMarketCap. Previously, the major crypto price tracker had removed key South Korean exchanges from its price average computations over what it described as an ���extreme divergence��� between prices listed there and on exchanges in other countries.	0
On the list of anti-cryptocurrency countries, Poland has never really stuck out. In fact, there has been enough evidence to suggest that the Eastern European country was moving towards embracing Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. However, a recently uncovered smear campaign by the NBP (National Polish Bank, or Central Bank) has thrown that all out of alignment. The NBP has admitted to paying a number of YouTubers a sum of about $21,000 in order to dissuade Polish citizens into buying cryptocurrencies for fear of losing all their money. The NBP has called this an ���educational campaign���, trying to get across the dangers of cryptocurrencies, but it has come across more as a smear campaign which raises questions about the Polish government���s view of cryptocurrencies. Poland, along with a number of EU countries, has never shown any true discontent for cryptocurrencies prior to this latest campaign to discredit them. Back in 2013, there were reports of an official from Polish Ministry of Finance saying, ���What is not forbidden is permitted. However, we certainly cannot consider Bitcoin to be a legal currency.��� In 2015, the Polish Finance Ministry issued a statement to the effect, ���Any regulatory action addressing the problems of trading virtual currencies. They should be taken either as a result of initiatives at the EU level with a view to the cross-border nature of the business or as a result of a threat market failure cryptocurrency.��� In an interview around February 2015, Filip Godecki, CCO of Bitcurex, a major Polish cryptocurrency exchange, explained the government���s stance as neutral: ���From our perspective, it would be difficult to talk about a negative trend. The attitude toward Bitcoin in Poland is neutral, converging with tendencies in most EU countries. Institutions are looking at the project from a certain distance, waiting for what comes next. The situation is similar with banks.��� In February 2017, trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was officially recognised in the country. It was stated on a governmental website that from Dec.1, 2016, ���The issuance of electronic currency and purchase and sale of electronic currency via the internet stand classified by official statistics services in Poland.��� While there may be no definitive stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies coming out of Poland, the government has seemingly allowed it to exist and continue functioning. One of the bigger indicators that the Polish government was leaning towards being Bitcoin friendly was when in March 2017 it released its Best Practices document to promote digitization of the national cryptocurrency market and help startups establish themselves in the market. These guidelines were followed by several other programs aimed at promoting cryptocurrency technologies, such as the Ministry of Digitization���s "Blockchain / DLT Stream and Digital Currencies" program. ��ven more telling is that many well known cryptocurrency businesses set up shop in Poland over the years because the banking system was so welcoming and a lot more liberal than many others in Europe. Even the British stock exchanges and even the infamous Mt.Gox had their financial backing set up in Poland. Despite Poland making no final call on its perception on Bitcoin, Blockchain and the entire cryptocurrency market place, there is evidence that the government sees potential and possibility in it. It therefore is very surprising that the Polish central Bank has launched this smear campaign that was partially hidden, but also unashamedly done. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Polish Journalist and Youtube-blogger Karol Paciorek briefly explained the math between this campaign: ���There was a product placement deal between NBP and three large youtube channels: Marcin Dubiel - 937,000 subscribers; Wi��nia - 818,000 subscribers; and Planeta Fakt��w 1 mln subscribers. It���s an educational campaign paid from a government-based organisation. Someone asked NBP how much they have paid for the campaign, and got an answer - $21 000.��� The issue is that these videos are very slanderous of Bitcoin, and could hardly be called educational in the real sense of the word. Furthermore, there was no indication that it was a paid-for, or sponsored, video. Another blogger, Maciek Budzich from the Mediafun Blog, has also written about the strange sponsored videos and their effect on the perception of cryptocurrencies in Poland. Budzich shows the actual response from the NBP when asked about the campaign, it details information including the figure spent. In Poland, every citizen has the right to ask the state authorities (as part of access to public information) about money and state spending.  Budzich states he is uncertain of the letter���s authenticity, but takes it as true pending any response from authorities. It has also appeared on other sources. It transpired, through Budzich, that Gamellon, a Youtube network partner company was the recipient of the state funds and that they had connections with some of the Youtube channels that were used. The only confirmation he got was that Gamellon cooperated with the NBP, but refused to share further details, and would not divulge the provisions of the contract. The evidence is clear that the Central Bank worked towards smearing cryptocurrencies on these Youtube channels which raises questions about the stance Poland will take when it does come down to regulating digital currencies in the country. There is further, tangible, evidence of the NBP���s thoughts on digital currencies with their information portal, which is labeled: ���Virtual currency is not money.��� It���s frontpage states: ���This is a digital implementation of a contractual value between two users that is not issued and is not guaranteed by any central bank of the world, such as Polish zloty, which is issued by the National Bank of Poland. Another risk is the lack of universal acceptance of such cryptocurrencies. Virtual currencies are not accepted in all retail stores and services. They are not a legal tender or currency.��� The campaign certainly got noticed, but probably for the wrong reasons as most media sources reported on the secret funding aspect, rather than the ���educational��� campaign. In Poland, when the news broke that the Youtube videos were paid for by the NDP, the reaction among the country���s crypto community was one of anger. Speaking to Cointelegraph, a local Polish cryptotrader going by the name of Crypto Polish Guru on Twitter, gave some insight: ���People are angry about this action, or they ignore it, the young people, that is. Older people don't watch Youtube! In my country, citizens do not like the government anyway.��� The advancement of Blockchain and fintech in Poland is also a bit stop-start according to Crypto Polish Guru. ���We have the Ministry of Digitization, but Minister Anna Stre��y��ska was dismissed two or three months ago. She created a Blockchain group to work towards building a good environment for crypto in Poland, for me that was one of our best ministers. Now I think that they will liquidate the Blockchain working group.��� The NBP���s decision to launch a biased and convoluted ���educational��� campaign based on the danger of Bitcoin is what is drawn into question here. It would be understandable and agreeable if they were to issue a statement, like they have done, about what cryptocurrency is and is not, but it seems strange that their attempts to get their warning across came over as such fearmongering. There was no link back to the NBP from the Youtubers, there was no ties from the videos to the bank. The connection only emerged when the NBP was queried on whether or not they were bankrolling the campaign. This calls into question the tactics of the central bank, and its motives in getting its point across in such a way. It also raises questions about how Poland will be regulating cryptocurrencies in the future.   Although the campaign was not broadcasted and advertised as a sponsored campaign by the NBP, they have never been afraid to furnish details of their so-called educational campaign. Tomasz Jaroszek, writing for doradca.tv, much like Budzich also questioned the NBP, and demanded a response, which he got. The NBP���s rather lengthy response defends their efforts in educating the Polish population on the dangers of cryptocurrencies, going to list a number of fair dangers, such as volatility and no central backing and cyber crimes. The NBP begin their gambit putting into context their authority to lead this campaign as they state they were carrying out their ���constitutional and statutory tasks��� for the sake of the ���value of Polish money, and the stability of the Polish financial system.��� Following the listed reasons of the dangers of cryptocurrencies the NBP then goes on to direct attention to a warning they put out in June last year before explaining the December campaign: ���The goal of the information campaign conducted since December 2017 is to reach the widest possible audience, potentially interested in using virtual currencies - including people who have no experience in risky investing - with basic knowledge about the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. This campaign hopes to make people interested in investing in cryptocurrencies refrain from actions that could bring them measurable losses, or if they will consciously take such actions, assume the risks associated with them. The NBP decided to conduct a campaign via the media - digital and traditional.��� The caveat however is that the NBP openly admitted it is not opposed to Blockchain technology, seemingly indicating this was not aimed to be a smear campaign: ���At the same time, we emphasize that the NBP is not opposed to the development of Blockchain technology and its use, but the application of this technology to the financial market must be just as safe and proven as it is with other technologies.��� It is hard to understand the NDP���s decision to act in such a manner. Clearly they have a duty to inform about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, but the campaign they went on seems confusing. Crypto Polish Guru���s closing remarks on why this played out in the way it did may have to do with a time when the NBP did not react. ���A few years ago in my country we had a large affair with Amber Gold - a company offering a high percentage returns for deposits made with them [essentially, a pyramid scheme]. It ended up going bankrupt and all investors lost all their money. At that time, the NBP, and other institutions didn't react at all and they were strongly criticized.���	1
On February 8 2018, 15 million Raiblocks, the former native currency of the Nano network,  were stolen from Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail.  In order to provide insights into alleged security breach and the theft of more than $150 million USD worth of XRB, Cointelegraph conducted an exclusive interview with Francesco Firano, the founder and operator of BitGrail. This time, Cointelegraph reached out to the Nano team and conducted an interview with the Nano core team���s Troy Retzer, who oversees community & public relations at the organization, to better understand the large-scale theft. During the interview with Cointelegraph, Firano claimed that the Nano core development team accused BitGrail of being insolvent and negligent in managing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funds. Firano added that the issue originated from the timestamp technology of Nano and that the block explorer of the cryptocurrency is not reliable. Firano said: ���Baseless and malicious accusations are done by the Nano development team. The truth is their block explorer is dated January 19, the date of the theft. Since RaiBlocks have no timestamps on the chain, we cannot really find out when it actually happened other than rely on the block explorer, which, as already shown by the private conversation they disclosed, is totally unreliable.��� However, Troy Retzer explained that on January 19, the date noted by Firano, the Nano blockchain network conducted a re-synchronization of its nodes, providing every block or transaction missing before January 19 with a timestamp recorded at the time. This meant that all transactions or blocks were recorded accurately, with a timestamp on that date. Retzer told Cointelegraph: ���On January 19, a node resync was conducted and in this process, it picked up on blocks not already having a timestamp record and recorded them at that time, with that timestamp. And to the reason why there were gaps, during the transition of the website there were lapses in the script running, while we handled the transition of the site from the previous admin to our current admin. We received a copy of the old database and worked for some time to get it running correctly on the new server, thus many blocks never had a timestamp recorded until the full sync on January 19.��� In regards to Firano���s comment that the Nano team has released malicious accusations against himself and the BitGrail trading platform, Retzer commented that the core team had not received any information from BitGrail and from Firano apart from the data he had released publicly. "It is difficult for us to help solve the situation due to a lack of information on the alleged hack,��� said Retzer, stating that BitGrail had failed to clarify basic details, such as how many XRB tokens were actually stolen from the exchange. Initial reports from BitGrail suggested it was 17 million, but reports released later this month claimed 15 million XRB tokens were stolen. The Nano team also emphasized that it has reached out to the Italian police in order to cooperate in the investigation of the theft and provide any assistance it may need in analyzing the BitGrail breach. On February 15, Firano released a Telegram conversation on his Twitter, in which he claimed that transactions before January 19 are missing on the block explorer of the Nano network. Firano also asserted that transactions were somehow removed and reinserted in a later date. But, in any public Blockchain, it is not possible to remove data stored in past blocks unless the entire Blockchain is compromised and attacked. pic.twitter.com/IsGS7CWOJh Even through public attacks such as a 51% attack (in which a group gains control over half of the Blockchain���s hash power), it is not realistically possible to modify data stored in historical blocks. In response to such claims, Nano developer Mica Busch wrote: ���A Blockchain, and the accounts within a block lattice, are one-way structures. Each references the cryptographic signature of its preceding block. It is impossible for new blocks to be inserted before newer block. Continuing this logic, our block explorer stores timestamps on a best effort basis. Therefore if a transaction shows a date later than another transaction that follows, we can prove that this transaction occurred before the later date, and regard the timestamp as erroneous.��� Given that Nano is a public Blockchain network and blocks within a Blockchain cannot be modified, a claim that transactions are missing from the Blockchain is likely not valid. On October 23 2017, as the Nano team disclosed in its official statement, a massive amount of XRB was abruptly withdrawn from the BitGrail cryptocurrency exchange. 1 million XRB was withdrawn, which is worth nearly $10 million based on the current price of XRB at $9.82. While the nature of this transaction is yet to be confirmed, it could also be possible that the theft of 15 million XRB tokens was initiated on October 23, starting with the withdrawal of 1 million XRB. ���Specifically, this transaction for a withdrawal of 1 million XRB occurred on October 23 2017, at 1:22 AM (GMT) according to BitGrail���s database timestamp data. You can see from the Explorer data that there were significant funds withdrawn before and after this transaction to account ���bbjn���. Firano categorized this transaction on Twitter and in our Telegram conversation as ���unauthorized������ states Nano���s report on the matter. According to the public Blockchain explorer of Nano, Nanode, BitGrail continued to use a hot wallet to store all of its funds in XRB, which is unsecure. Hot wallets are managed online, and can be vulnerable to attacks and security breaches as a consequence. For example, Japan���s Coincheck, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, suffered a $530 million hacking attack due to the exchange  storing funds in hot wallets. Until December 16 2017, the BitGrail Rep 1 wallet was used as  the only hot wallet of the BitGrail exchange to store user funds, which is extremely insecure and dangerous. Once a hot wallet is compromised, all of the funds within it can be lost, especially if there are no multi-signature technology-based security systems in place. On December 16, the BitGrail Rep 1 wallet was changed to a cold wallet, and BitGrail Rep 2 was changed to a hot wallet, as seen on Nanode. It is not possible to definitively state that the BitGrail trading platform was breached due to poor security measures, unless and until all of the information regarding the theft is transparently shared with the community. But, unlike Coincheck and other large-scale cryptocurrency exchanges like South Korea���s Bithumb, BitGrail has not been able to refund its investors and as Firano explained in its interview with Cointelegraph, the business believes it is ���impossible��� to refund all of its Nano investors. Ultimately, as an independent company, BitGrail might be held responsible for the theft of the funds of its customers if it is found that the cause of the theft of the 15 million XRBs on the platform is not due to an issue of the Nano Blockchain protocol.	0
Impact, a Canadian NGO, has left the Kimberley Process initiative on Jan. 22, citing the fact that the global agreement to prevent dealing in ���blood diamonds��� has not lived up to its goals. Joanne Lebert, executive director at IMPACT, told the Financial Times, ���There���s no meaningful assurance that a diamond is conflict free [...] The public is under the wrong impression that the problem is solved. I think it���s time to challenge that narrative again.��� Impact���s announcement comes a week after De Beers, one of the largest diamond producers, revealed a pilot Blockchain initiative to ensure their diamonds are conflict-free. De Beers���s Blockchain program is designed to prevent conflict-diamonds from entering the markets by tracking each diamond from the instant that it is mined. Their website reads: ���This single, tamper-proof digital diamond ledger will underpin confidence in diamonds and create a permanent record for each registered diamond that is as everlasting as the diamond itself.��� De Beers told the FT that its new initiative is not designed to fix or replace the Kimberley Process. The company promises to continue to support the global agreement even as it experiments with Blockchain to ensure the trade of only conflict-free diamonds.	1
Conflicting reports today, Jan. 11, have led to confusion after a South Korean minister announced plans of a bill intended to ban cryptocurrency trading in the country. According to Reuters, South Korean officials are working on documentation that will make it illegal to trade virtual currencies on local exchanges. The country���s Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said the decision comes in the wake of discussions and agreements between governmental departments, including its Finance Ministry and financial regulators. Reuters reported that Sang-ki announced the ban in a press conference, stating: ���There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges.��� However, South Korea-based Cointelegraph contributor Joseph Young reported on his personal Twitter today, citing local sources, that the South Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance does not agree with the proposal from the Ministry of Justice to ban cryptocurrency trade in the country. Young reports that a final decision has yet to be made. South Korea Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MSF)   "We do not share the same views as the Ministry of Justice on a potential #cryptocurrency exchange ban."   MSF is upset MoJ released premature statement.   Massive confusion.https://t.co/anbsOJz1KX As reported on Dec. 25, South Korea set up a task force to create legislation for the rapidly growing crypto market in the country. Contrary to an outright ban, the body plans to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges as legitimate financial service providers, and ban foreigners and underaged investors from trading on South Korean exchanges. The popularity of cryptocurrency trading in South Korea has seen the price of virtual currencies trading far higher than exchanges in different countries. Nevertheless, the minister���s remarks led to a sell-off of cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin (BTC) price in South Korea plunged 21 percent down to $17,064. This lower BTC price in South Korea is still far higher than the average Bitcoin price on CoinMarketCap ($13,501 at press time), which excludes South Korean exchanges, due to the divergence in prices of cryptocurrencies in the country. As of late December 2017, South Korea accounts for up to a fifth of global cryptocurrency trade. Reuters also reported Jan. 11 that South Korea���s largest cryptocurrency exchange operators were ���raided��� by police and tax authorities amid allegations of tax evasion this week. According to Reuters, an official from the popular South Korean exchange Coinone said authorities regarded exchange operators in a negative light: ���Local police also have been investigating our company since last year; they think what we do is gambling.��� Once again, word from correspondents inside South Korea is that the reports of a ���raid��� are not accurate, and have been embellished by mainstream media outside the country. Cointelegraph���s South Korea correspondent this time retweeted CNBC���s Cryptotrader host Ran Neuner, confirming that the so-called ���raids��� on exchanges were actually just routine visits from tax authorities. Young notes that local media are calling the ���raid��� an ���unexpected friendly visit���: Fake News Reuters claiming South Korean #cryptocurrency and #Bitcoin exchanges were raided by police.   While local reporters and other media outlets are reporting it was an unexpected friendly visit.   Raid means something completely different @Reuters https://t.co/0c9NOApSKY Another South Korea-based trader noted on Twitter that the situation was a result of confusion both on the part of authorities and the exchanges themselves, who are reportedly willing to comply if given applicable legislation is put into place: ���There's a lot of confusion on all sides, gov. and exchanges.��� On the fiat side of things, on Jan. 7 local South Korean media reported that the country���s authorities were planning to probe six major banks to look for alleged money laundering linked to cryptocurrency exchanges.	0
A Harvard economist told CNBC Tuesday, March 6 that Bitcoin is ���more likely to be worth $100 than $100,000��� by 2028. Speaking to reporters during an edition of the network���s Squawk Box segment, professor and economist Kenneth Rogoff implied Bitcoin only had value because of its use in ���money laundering and tax evasion.��� ���I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000 ten years from now,��� he said, continuing: ���Basically, if you take away the possibility of money laundering and tax evasion, [Bitcoin���s] actual uses as a transaction vehicle are very small.��� Rogoff joins a diminishing number of traditional finance figures still maintaining a firm anti-Bitcoin stance. Despite high-profile naysayers such as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon U-turning on their negative opinions in recent months, others remain highly skeptical. Last month, Berkshire Hathaway vice president Charlie Munger adopted a particularly harsh tone, telling the audience during an AGM speech that Bitcoin was ���totally asinine��� and that people investing in it ���disgusted��� him. Despite mixed perspectives on price performance, the implication of Bitcoin in organized crime has come under more serious doubt this year. Despite Europol this month suggesting as much as $5.5 bln per year is laundered via cryptocurrency, Bitcoin in particular has lost favor with perpetrators, who allegedly prefer other more anonymous assets such as Monero. Rogoff meanwhile appears alone in suggesting regulation will force the price of Bitcoin down, not up, while many industry commentators welcome regulatory moves as a step towards mainstream acceptance and adoption.	1
As Bitcoin powered ahead to a new high for a second week in a row, some have speculated that institutional investors could seek safe haven in the virtual currency in the future. The prevailing rhetoric over the past month has been more affirming than damning of cryptocurrencies, with the likes of Ronnie Moas and Max Keiser predicting new highs in 2018. Speaking to RT, eToro analyst Mikhail Mashchenko says financial institutions could look to Bitcoin if a major financial crash hits global markets. ���The demand for Bitcoin is growing as the crypto market has become less volatile, and an increasing number of professional investors see it as insurance.��� The current bull market in stocks is the second-longest in history, according to Fortune, having lasted 104 months so far. The longest bull market in history ended in 2000 after an impressive 113 month run. With the current rally getting a bit long in the tooth, many on Wall Street are making contingency plans for the stock market���s inevitable turn. If Mashchenko is right, Bitcoin will have a role in some of these plans. Mashchenko���s statements come on the back of changing sentiment in the mainstream financial sector. Last week, JP Morgan Chase announced plans to offer Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - an important move by one of the biggest banking and financial services providers in America. Even more satisfying, this moves comes only months after Chase CEO Jamie Dimon condemned Bitcoin as a scam. Online banking service providers and exchange operators LedgerX and Revolut are also adopting Bitcoin support. The former was recently cleared to offer Bitcoin derivatives as people look to do more than just trade the cryptocurrency. ���LedgerX launched its first long-term options for Bitcoin, with an expiration date of December 28, 2018. In the coming months, we will continue to see the ���domestication��� of Bitcoin: the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are planning to launch tools based on the cryptocurrency in the near future.��� If and when a stream of institutional investors start investing large amounts of capital into cryptocurrencies, some of the stunning predictions made by Bitcoin bulls could well be realised. However, Mashchenko���s prediction was quite conservative, suggesting that Bitcoin reaching a $10,000 high by the end of 2017 would be driven by emotion rather than fundamentals: ���We could see a Bitcoin at $10,000 in a month or so. However, such a surge will be based on emotions, not on fundamental factors. So, further growth of the cryptocurrency will require something more than euphoria.��� Having hit the $8,000 mark last week, Bitcoin surged another $1,000 dollars in just a few days, breaching the $9,000 level during the Thanksgiving weekend. At press time, the price of Bitcoin sits at $9,500, just $500 below Mashcenko���s predicted level.	2
Gold Bullion International co-founder Dan Tapiero believes that it���s only a matter of time before Bitcoin���s (BTC) price surges into the six-figure threshold.  Speaking to Anthony Pompliano on the Pomp Podcast, Tapiero asserted that in terms of price appreciation, Bitcoin is king, even though he believes investors should own both gold and Bitcoin: He went on to add, ���I don���t really think that anyone in the gold world [...] they are not going to debate that.��� Tapiero believes that institutional investors and finance whales are likely to invest between 5% and 15% of their portfolios in Bitcoin, and noted that the sector was currently worth $100 trillion:  Bitcoin is a hedge for the fiat system, he explained, and once its market cap is in the trillions of dollars, it will become easier to handle for larger investors, similar to gold. But gold is a store of value, and that is only one aspect of what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is an entire network, and that���s why he believes it will be much bigger than gold: Other analysts are similarly bullish about Bitcoin, with Off the Chain Capital chief investment officer Brian Estes telling Reuters today that it ���is not a stretch��� for BTC to surpass $100,000 in one year, and predicted that it could go as high as $288,000 by the end of 2021. CNBC host Jim Cramer also believes in the future of Bitcoin, as revealed on another podcast with Pompliano. Cramer, who was a Bitcoin skeptic during the 2017 bull market, recently stated that he had since realized that Bitcoin is a good hedge against inflation and also one that his kids can understand:	2
Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz has admitted the company could be forced by validators to burn its 48 billion XRP tokens, regardless of if it agrees with the decision or not. The company currently holds half the total XRP supply and has come under fire from the community for selling off tokens in the past, although it resolutely refuted claims of price manipulation and has stopped the practice in recent times. In a Twitter thread, Schwartz confirmed that the community could vote for Ripple to burn their entire supply of XRP tokens, stating that the blockchain is ���very democratic.��� XRP Ledger amendments require an 80% approval rating from the ledger���s validators and are activated if they stay above that threshold for two weeks. In June, validators on the XRPL notably voted to adopt a new amendment, dubbed ���the Checks Amendment,��� without support from Ripple. The amendment introduces the ability for users to write checks to each other for a predetermined amount of XRP that can be redeemed at a later period. Schwartz���s comments come as something of a postscript to an incident in November last year in which it was revealed Ripple could also unilaterally decide to burn the billions in excess supply. At the time Stellar had just reduced its total supply of 105 billion XLM tokens down to 50 billion. Schwartz hit out at the Stellar Development Fund for burning more than 50% of the total XLM tokens writing: Stellar co-founder Jed McCaleb fired back that Ripple could burn just as many tokens, just as easily: Wtf are you talking about. Ripple labs can burn half the XRP supply. Schwartz conceded that it could be done, explaining that it would have to be through a non-traditional method like using the tokens as fees or sending them to an account that could never be accessed. Ripple has been the subject of long-standing criticism for routinely selling tokens. According to a report in early 2020 by XRPArcade, the firm sold an average of 196 million XRP per month since December of 2017. As of April, a total of 5.5 billion XRP had been sold, or $3.45 billion at the time of writing. In the second and third quarters this year, Ripple stopped selling XRP and started buying back the tokens to support its price. In Q3, the firm purchased $45.5 million in XRP.	1
Venezuela���s Minister of Foreign Trade and International Investment Jos�� Vielma Mora announced on Thursday, Feb. 8, that foreign investors will be accepting payments for their goods in petro, says Latin American government-sponsored news outlet TeleSur. The petro, an oil-backed state cryptocurrency set to be released in both a pre-sale and an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), was first announced by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in December 2017. The petro���s white paper released Jan. 30 explains that the idea for the petro came from Hugo Chavez, who had envisioned a ���strong currency backed by raw materials.��� Mora said that Brazilian businesspeople are prepared to invest $300 mln in Venezuela, beginning with a $100 mln inversion investment. The minister also listed Poland, Denmark, Honduras, Norway, and Vietnam as foreign countries that would be willing to receive petro in exchange for food and medicine, citing a total amount of $435 mln. According to Mora, Canada has also expressed interest in investing in Venezuela in the sphere of ���pharmaceutics for humans and animals.��� The petro is an ERC20 token that has been pre-mined on the Ethereum Blockchain, with each petro is backed by one barrel of oil. Maduro had ordered the issuance of 100 mln in petro on Jan. 14 in preparation for the pre-sale. The creation of the petro has been viewed skeptically by critics and members of the Venezuelan opposition parliament who consider the petro a fraudulent currency that could help Maduro avoid sanctions. The petro���s pre-sale will take place from Feb. 20 at -04:00 UTC to Mar. 19 at -04:00 UTC, and there will be 38.4 mln tokens available. Pre-sale tokens ���may be exchanged for petro [coins] at any time between the launch date and the closing of the initial offer,��� according to the white paper. The ICO will take place a day after the end of the pre-sale, Mar. 20 at -04:00 GMT, with 44 mln petro available for sale at a reference selling point of $60 - the price of a barrel of oil in Venezuela in the second week of Jan. 2018. The price is subject to market fluctuations, according to the white paper. The white paper writes that the Venezuelan government will accept petro as payment for national taxes, fees, and public services, and it will be regulated by the Cryptocurrency Superintendency and the National Blockchain Observatory.	2
The financial services provider Western Union (WU) is testing transactions with the use of Ripple���s (XRP) Blockchain-based settlement system, the company���s Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal said in an interview with Bloomberg Feb. 14. The globally known money transfer company Western Union confirmed that it is testing Ripple following more than a month of rumor-fuelled speculation that began in early January. The announcement comes after Western Union reported its 2017 results, claiming a revenue of $1.4 bln - a 5 percent increase over the previous year. As Ripple���s CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Bloomberg, WU has decided to look into their platform in order to facilitate money transfers, particularly cross-border ones. Garlinghouse explained their choice by claiming that Ripple allows for transactions that are ���a thousand times faster and a thousand times cheaper than Bitcoin���s.��� According to Bloomberg, Western Union���s Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek also confirmed that testing is taking place during a conference call Tuesday, Feb. 13. ���We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,��� Ersek said, adding ���we do have some tests with Ripple.��� Ripple (XRP) is a Blockchain-based settlement protocol and a cryptocurrency that has reached almost half of Bitcoin���s market capitalization in early January 2018, when its price rallied to over $3.00 per coin. By the middle of January, however, the XRP price has bounced back to a little over $1.00. Wednesday, Feb. 14, Cointelegraph reported on a partnership signed between Ripple and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to provide the technology for cross-border payments to banks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).	2
Shiba Inu (SHIB) was listed on three different cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 48 hours after an explosive 966% surge in the same time frame sent the token to 18th in the market capitalization rankings. Self-described as the ���Dogecoin Killer,��� SHIB���s instant addition to Binance on Monday surprised onlookers, many of whom expected a more in-depth listing process by the world���s largest crypto exchange.  What���s more, the fact that 50% of the SHIB token supply is in the hands of one individual made Binance���s decision to list the token immediately all the more surprising.  The Shiba team purposely sent 50% of the 1 quadrillion token supply to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin as a means to put the tokens out of circulation. The other 50% was apparently sent to the Uniswap app to provide liquidity. In doing so, the creators claim to have created a decentralized token, the fate of which will be decided solely by the market.  Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao spoke out on the issue of Shiba Inu on Monday, telling his Twitter audience that the exchange was simply following user demand. Zhao said demand to trade SHIB was so high that Binance ran out of deposit addresses for the Ethereum-based token: ���Not endorsing it. Super high risk. NFA,��� he added.  Shiba Inu���s recent emergence came fresh on the back of the rise of Dogecoin (DOGE). Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu is emblazoned with a variation of the Shiba Inu dog meme. Also like Dogecoin, Shiba awakened from months of inactivity to surge to what was an all-time high on April 20 ��� i.e., 4/20 day ��� the same day Dogecoin reached a then all-time high of $0.420. But what is there to Shiba Inu except for funny dogs and crazy percentage gains? Well, the project���s ���woofpaper��� alludes to the creation of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where SHIB holders will be able to swap tokens and take part in yield farming. The exchange is currently undergoing ���security tests, audits and final updates,��� according to the project���s website. In addition to SHIB, the project also encompasses a multi-token system consisting of BONE and LEASH. All three are expected to be used as part of Shiba Inu���s yield farming feature.  In addition to Binance and FTX, the OKEx exchange also fell in line and listed Shiba Inu according to Tuesday���s press release. OKEx CEO Jay Hao used the term ���experimental��� to describe the motivations behind the token listing and declared a willingness to list ���memetic��� tokens. ���We are pleased to welcome Shiba Inu to the OKEx platform. I appreciate their experimental spirit, which is exactly what the blockchain and crypto space needs. As an exchange, we are delighted to be able to offer a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies, including memetic tokens,��� said Hao. CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator with close to 100 million views per month, still hasn���t given Shiba Inu a proper listing. By all accounts, this is because it has thus far failed to determine accurate circulation numbers for the token.  We asked Binance how the presence of 500 trillion SHIB (worth over $15 billion) in Vitalik Buterin���s personal wallet affected its calculations of the token���s circulating supply. Binance refused to comment on matters relating to Shiba Inu.	1
Shares of crypto mining company Riot Blockchain (RIOT) plunged on Thusday, giving back a portion of a parabolic rally that was largely driven by news of a major boost in hash rate capacity.  RIOT fell 20.4% to close at $62.03 on Thursday but was moving slightly higher in after-hours trading. At current values, RIOT has a total market capitalization of $4.2 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the blockchain industry.  The sharp pullback follows a more than doubling in price between Feb. 10 and Feb. 17. The weeklong rally saw RIOT peak just below $78.00 before Thursday���s pullback.  Since the beginning of the month, Riot���s stock price has gained a whopping 202%.  RIOT began its most recent parabolic rally shortly after the company announced it expected to achieve a hash rate capacity of 1.06 exahash per second with the deployment of 2,002 S19 Pro Antminers.  On Feb. 11, CEO Jason Les said: Just a few weeks prior, the company said it planned to achieve a hash rate capacity of 3.8 exahash per second by the end of 2021.  When Cointelegraph last covered Riot Blockchain in Nov 2020, the stock was trading at $6, having gained 500% on the year. At the time, the Colorado-based company had appointed Hubert Marleau, the former director for the listing committee for the Toronto Stock Exchange, to Riot���s board of directors.	2
Use cases for Bitcoin have been popping up everywhere, with new ���Accepts Bitcoin��� signs on everything from coffee carts to retail stores in South Africa. These adoption cases are important as the continued use of Bitcoin will only increase the adoption and price cycle, commonly referred to as a Satoshi cycle. In a new and interesting twist, an entire real estate transaction has taken place via Bitcoin. In other words, you can now buy your house with Bitcoin���at least in Texas. The transaction was for the purchase of a newly built custom home, and the full purchase price was transferred to the seller/builder via Bitcoin. The seller then converted the coin into USD. The broker for the purchase said: "In all of my 33 years of closing transactions, I honestly couldn't have expected something so unique to go so smoothly. In a matter of 10 minutes, the Bitcoin was changed to US Dollars and the deal was done!��� The purchase of the home as an agreement between buyer and seller represents another step toward widespread acceptance of the currency. Other companies are seeking to use tokenization of assets to allow smaller-scale real estate investment via Blockchain technology as well.	2
People have been talking about cryptocurrencies and Blockchain for the past few years. The innovation of Blockchain is undergoing more improvements, and the platform is getting stable. In line with that, many people are starting to invest in Bitcoin and the other digital currencies. Businesses are now venturing out to explore Blockchain platform. Companies have research and studies about the possibility of applying the principle of the network- how it will be beneficial to the company and the consumers. Lately, Trickbot has been a hot topic for attacking financial sectors. It has plagued the banks around the world. According to FraudWatch, the way Trickbot penetrates the banking systems is by using a malvertising campaign. The Trickbot Trojan hamper significantly in US, UK and Australia in a new spam campaign which is Nercus-powered by productive botnets. Researchers say that the spam campaign has been active for a few months. The malware attack targets to steal the login details, personal information and authentication codes. On the recent attack of the Trickbot banking Trojan, spam campaigns spread and imitate the domain used by the financial institutions. SANS ISC handler, Brad Duncan says: "Almost all of these domains were registered through GoDaddy using various names or privacy services. And these domains were implemented on servers using full email authentication and HTTPS.  Many recipients could easily be tricked into opening the associated attachments.��� There is no concise report yet if GoDaddy takes action on the case. The Blockchain platform, which is closely related to financial institutions is also not able to avoid the attack of Trickbot. According to Forcepoint, they found out a Trickbot campaign which targets cryptocurrencies and reported to have targeted PayPal. Coinbase is an exchange site which solely involves cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and digital assets. Malware also targets Coinbase which means that cryptocurrencies are also at risk from being stolen. Researchers said that the malware has been ongoing over the web last year, targeting banks and resume attacking today upon adding cryptocurrency exchange website to their list. The issue is a challenge to the stability and reliability of the Blockchain platform on how it will work out to figure if such cryptocurrency is stolen or acquired from a malware attack since every coin has a unique code itself. Also, investors and business people will see the insusceptibility of the platform from Trickbot and malware alike.	0
This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Interest in Bitcoin hit its high point leading up to its own high of $20,000 in the middle of December last year. Interest peaked, not only in investing circles, but also in the mainstream as Bitcoin became the buzzword on everyone's lips. This adoption was championed by Bitcoin as it welcomed millions of users to the cryptocurrency community, as expressed in Coinbase���s figures alone. However, in this fast paced ecosystem, Bitcoin is not enough to hold the attention of this vastly diverse community. So, while it may be the ideal coin to get people hooked on cryptocurrencies, once they are in and settled, there is time to seek out a multitude of other coins that are better suited to their needs or beliefs. Bitcoin���s biggest draw was the incredible returns it was offering as it rallied from 2,000 percent in 12 months. This phenomenal growth continued to increase interest in the currency, and that sparked even further growth in this massive hype cycle. It has been correlated before that searches for on Google for Bitcoin are closely related to its growth - a phenomenon known as the ���Satoshi Cycle���. In the lead up to December���s high, the Satoshi Cycle was in full effect as Google trends showed some interesting figures. Nicholas Colas, a pioneering Bitcoin analyst in the world of traditional investments, has taken this correlation very seriously and states that it plays a big part in his predictions. "Going into December, [searches] skyrocketed," Colas said on CNBC���s Fast Money. He added that the total number of Bitcoin Google searches worldwide tripled that month: "You saw that correlates to the total increased number of wallet growth, which doubled in December from approximately 5 percent to 10 percent as Bitcoin rallied.��� However, taking this metric into consideration, it could be argued that the new wave of adopters are now starting to disperse and find their way to other coins that are more suited to their individual needs. It makes sense that as people become educated and learn more about options in the crypto community that they begin to diversify and pick out their favourite coins to invest in. This often leads to money moving away from Bitcoin and into Altcoins. Bitcoin, being the dominant, most adopted and scene-leading coin, will continue to be the ���gateway drug��� of the community, but it is finding it harder to hang on to total support and dominance. These sentiments are expressed by Colas, who adds: "Bitcoin is considered the gateway drug to all cryptos and it has acted exactly that way. Right now [the Google search data] is telling me there's not really that next leg up in Bitcoin because there's not that interest that leads to wallet growth that leads to price appreciation." Colas tries to justify this position by explaining how Ethereum has been the only coin that has fared relatively well in the top echelons of the CoinMarket Cap: ���Some of the movement in Ethereum, which has traded much better [in January], is just money which is being pulled out of Bitcoin." However, it is important to note that Bitcoin���s price fluctuations and movements are still heavily linked to all other coins. The saying that: ���the tide moves all boats��� is still true in the cryptocurrency market with Bitcoin essentially being the tide. When Bitcoin is up, most coins follow, and when it is down, the same red graphs appear to follow suit across the board.	2
Major cryptocurrency company Ripple has not given up on its plans to go public despite its ongoing legal battle with United States regulators, according to SBI Group���s CEO. Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of Japanese financial giant SBI Group, claimed that Ripple plans to become a public company after the firm settles a legal action brought against it by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Speaking on a Wednesday earnings presentation call, Kitao said that both Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and executive chairman Chris Larsen are planning to take Ripple public: Kitao said that SBI���s investment in Ripple would pay off following a potential public listing, noting that SBI is the largest outside shareholder of Ripple.  Kitao further predicted that blockchain consortium R3 ��� another industry company actively supported by SBI ��� will also go public one day. ���We have been investing in fintech companies and we adopt that technology in our group and also we spread that technology across the industry. That is SBI Group���s basic strategy,��� Kitao stated. Garlinghouse hinted at a potential initial public offering last year, predicting that IPOs would become more prevalent in the crypto and blockchain industry. ���In the next 12 months, you���ll see IPOs in the crypto/blockchain space. We���re not going to be the first and we���re not going to be the last, but I expect us to be on the leading side. It���s a natural evolution for our company,��� he said. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs as well as Garlinghouse and Larsen in December 2020, alleging that XRP was a $1.3-billion unregistered securities offering. The company has managed to achieve a series of legal victories, bringing more hopes from investors regarding the lawsuit���s outcome and driving XRP price above $1.4 ��� a level not seen since January 2018. Ripple did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph���s request for comment.	1
The hacker that breached hardware wallet provider Ledger���s marketing database earlier this year has released personal data for thousands of users, prompting many to threaten the firm with a class-action lawsuit. According to a tweet from network security firm Hudson Rock's Alon Gal, a hacker allegedly behind the breach of personal data from hardware wallet Ledger in June has made all the information they obtained available online. This reportedly includes 1,075,382 email addresses from users subscribed to the Ledger newsletter, and 272,853 hardware wallet orders with information including email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers. ALERT: Threat actor just dumped @Ledger's database which have been circling around for the past few months.The database contains information such as Emails, Physical Addresses, Phone numbers and more information on 272,000 Ledger buyers and Emails of 1,000,000 additional users. pic.twitter.com/Sv9cQwhuNy "This leak holds major risk to the people affected by it," said Gal. "Individuals who purchased a Ledger tend to have high net worth in cryptocurrencies and will now be subject to both cyber harassments as well as physical harassments in a larger scale than experienced before." In a response on Twitter, Ledger said "early signs" seemed to confirm that the released information was from the June data breach that compromised the personal data of many of its users. Following news of the hack, many Ledger users reported being targeted through phishing attempts. Some said they received convincing-looking emails asking them to download a new version of the Ledger software.  "We are continuously working with law enforcement to prosecute hackers and stop these scammers," said Ledger. "We have taken down more than 170 phishing websites since the original breach." After experiencing months of reports on phishing attacks, many users were seemingly unsatisfied with Ledger's response.  "If any lawyers want to start a class action suit, I���m sure many of us will jump on board," said Twitter user Ryan Olah. "This has just gotten 10,000x worse now." I���m going to take legal action against you very soon. Though someone's tokens are most likely not in danger of being siphoned out of Ledger wallets, users could potentially compromise their own funds by falling for such phishing attempts sent to the affected emails or phone numbers. Many have reported that such attacks have been trying to trick them into giving up their seed phrases, prompting Ledger to reiterate:   However, some Ledger users pointed out that phishing attacks are just one possible threat they may face now that their physical addresses are public. People with a large amount of crypto holdings run the risk of being kidnapped and held until they give up their tokens, as was the case with Singaporean entrepreneur Mark Cheng in January.  "This is a serious breach and I am concerned that people now have our addresses," said Twitter user Paul Smith. "What's stopping them from knocking on our doors? Saying sorry, frankly, isn't enough."	1
Bitcoin climbed 11 percent into Friday to post its highest price since mid-December: one coin was worth $16,920, cross-exchange data shows. Exchanges tracked by Coinmarketcap recorded an average trade price maximum of just under $17,000 earlier Friday before a slight correction saw Bitcoin head back towards $16,000. The performance is encouraging for holders who have watched profits ebb as altcoin markets continue to surge. The trend marks a pause after several weeks of bearish action for BTC, which did not immediately correct following its dip from $20,000 to around $13,000 last month. On social media, casual traders were eyeing Bitcoin���s reversal to continue, noting its impact on altcoin markets. alts bounce because of this.... BTC is a reversal pattern pic.twitter.com/yTOlD8JRih   Lots of questions flying in right now about #BTC.   1. I don't know when/IF it will keep rising. But, I think it will personally.  2. I am waiting patiently. Need patience in this game. I will be buying in when it is even lower. I believe another drop is coming.   ? Optimism from well-known figures has remained unshaken meanwhile, despite newfound investor and mainstream interest in Ripple and continuing publicity maneuvers from Bitcoin Cash proponents. An alleged compromise Thursday saw the @Bitcoin Twitter account begin publishing pro-Bitcoin Cash content, listing a graphic from major proponent Roger Ver comparing the altcoin���s and Bitcoin���s perceived advantages. Flagging the event, online commentator WhalePanda also gave kudos to a theory circulating on Reddit regarding current price movements in both Bitcoin and altcoin markets. This is actually a very interesting theory on the #Bitcoin and current altcoin manipulation. TLDR; Big players can't accumulate Bitcoin without moving the price too much, so they pump and dump "cheap" alts to accumulate Bitcoin. https://t.co/oA0eW2KLE9 ���Big players can't accumulate Bitcoin without moving the price too much, so they pump and dump ���cheap��� alts to accumulate Bitcoin,��� he summarized the idea originally published on Reddit.	2
Traders and investors are coming back to Bitcoin due to the lock-in of BIP 91 and the high probability of Segregated WItness being activated in the near future. Bitcoin���s dominance over the cryptocurrency market is closing on 50 percent, with the Bitcoin dominance index currently at 48 percent.  A month ago, when the Bitcoin scaling debate was being prolonged and the mining community pushed for the activation of SegWit2x without the BIP 91 activation mechanism, the dominance index of Bitcoin dropped to an all-time low at 37.47 percent. The dominance index of Bitcoin dropped from nearly 60 percent to 37.47 percent in a period of a few months due to the certainty in Bitcoin scaling and the reluctance of miners to activate SegWit. As user-activated soft fork (UASF) and SegWit2x asserted pressure toward the mining community to avoid a chain split and scale the Bitcoin network securely and efficiently, the mining community including Bitmain, which previously revealed the possibility of an Aug. 1 hard fork, began to signal for BIP 91 and SegWit. Already, BIP 91 is fully locked in and the community anticipating for the signaling of Bit 1, which would then finalize the activation of SegWit. Bitcoin Core developers including Peter Todd stated that there is a 25 percent chance that SegWit will not be activated if miners decide to shift away from the BiP 91 activation mechanism. ���The reason why I think it's [failure to activate SegWit] as high a chance as 25 percent is because there's a few ways to renegotiation on SegWit with plausible deniability. For instance, miners could "accidentally" mine a bunch of BIP-91 invalid blocks - e.g. claiming it was due to validationless spy-mining - and then decide not to reorganize out those blocks,��� said Todd.  But, it is highly likely that SegWit will be activated in the near future, as major mining pools including Antpool, the largest mining pool in the market operated by Bitmain, has started to signal Bit 1 in their blocks. As a result, traders and investors that lost confidence in Bitcoin and Bitcoin scaling who likely panic sold during a major market correction earlier this month returned to Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms including Coinbase experienced a drastic increase in users, with Coinbase adding a staggering 100,000 users in three days. The activation of SegWit will also lead to the creation of Lightning Network-based Bitcoin micropayments applications. Some Blockchain infrastructure providers and Bitcoin firms including Bitfury have developed Lightning-focused wallet platforms to allow users to transact micropayments with zero confirmations. Hence, the activation of SegWit through BIP 91 will trigger the Bitcoin development community and will lead to the emergence of unique and innovative applications that will likely further scale the Bitcoin network. Although other major Blockchain networks including Ethereum have also recovered from the previous major market correction, Bitcoin has shown a speedy recovery with the activation of SegWit and demonstrated a 11 percent increase in the Bitcoin dominance index.	2
Bitcoin���s tumultuous December continued this week as the South Korean government expressed concerns at the lack of regulatory control over cryptocurrency exchanges. The country has been at the forefront of massive cryptocurrency adoption this year and the government has struggled to keep up with developments and trading in the industry, where arbitrage between exchanges is commonplace. Earlier in December, the South Korean government laid out plans to shut down some exchanges in the country and they reiterated those plans this week. Bitcoin has recently been trading nearly 30 percent higher on South Korean exchanges compared to average international rates, according to Bloomberg. Policy makers seem intent on curbing - or at least slowing - the currency���s enormous popularity. In a press release, the South Korean government expressed its worry over what is being labelled as a cryptocurrency ���obsession��� in the country: ���Cryptocurrency speculation has been irrationally overheated in Korea. The government can���t leave the abnormal situation of speculation any longer.��� Plans to wrestle back some control over cryptocurrency trading includes banning banks from providing virtual accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges. Likewise, the government reiterated its authority to close cryptocurrency exchanges, but stopped short of stating its intention to do so. Given that South Korea is accountable for up to a fifth of the world���s cryptocurrency trade, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum both tumbled on Thursday, perhaps in reaction to the uncertainty created by the government���s most recent misgivings. Bitcoin saw a 12% dip in value over 24 hours, dropping from $14,900 to a low of $13,100. However, the market has largely recovered, rising to $14,800 at press time.	0
BitPay, one of the companies affected by Visa suspending the status of the WaveCrest debit card provider this Friday, has released an announcement about the event today, on Saturday. In the statement, the company reassures its customers that the funds they had stored on their BitPay cards at the time of closure are safe, and will be eventually returned to them. This comes after similar updates issued by Bitwala and Wirex, whose business was also impacted. In an unexpected turn of events, yesterday, Jan. 5, Visa required WaveCrest, a Europe-based debit card issuer to ���to immediately close all [its] Visa cards." As a result, a number of cryptocurrency card providers that relied on WaveCrest for transaction processing have been forced to suspend their services as well, including BitPay, Bitwala, TenX and Wirex. In a statement regarding its decision, Visa said: "[We] recently terminated a single prepaid card issuer in Europe from our network for violating Visa's operating regulations. That issuer, WaveCrest, was required to close its Visa card products, some of which were linked to cryptocurrency wallets." Bitwala and Wirex have already issued their statements on Visa���s decision this Friday. Both companies reiterated the fact that neither Visa nor WaveCrest have given them enough warning to prepare for the hasty discontinuation of service. Moreover, they claim that the users��� money is safe, and will be refunded in due time. Now, BitPay has joined in with an update of their own. In the statement, the card provider announces that all its non-US cards have been deactivated and will not be available for further payments or withdrawals. Fortunately for cardholders, BitPay claimed that they ���will get a refund for ending card balance and for any outstanding card loads.��� Additionally, everyone who ordered their card after Dec. 1, 2017, will have the card order fee refunded to them as well. Going forward, BitPay, similarly to Bitwala and Wirex, claims that it is ���already in discussions��� with potential alternative card issuers that will allow the company to resume its cryptocurrency debit card services in near future. It is worth noting that Visa���s most recent decision to suspend the status of WaveCrest is seemingly unrelated to the latter���s dealings with cryptocurrency services providers. As per the official statement made by Visa: ���Our actions were not specific to cryptocurrency, but rather reflect the [WaveCrest���s] failure to comply with Visa's policies that ensure the safety and integrity of our payment system."	2
Popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced on its site today, Feb. 9, that it has completed its system upgrade after technical difficulties resulted in significant delays. The company���s post confirmed all functionality would return at 10am UTC Feb. 9, with Binance offering a two-week 70% discount on trading fees as a sign of ���gratitude for their unwavering support throughout the upgrade process.��� Binance has risen to international fame in the brief six-month period it has existed on the cryptocurrency exchange market. This week, CEO Changpeng Zhao was named as one of the crypto industry���s ���richest people��� in a first-of-its-kind list from Forbes, having already appeared on mainstream media as an industry expert, even publicly criticising Warren Buffett. As of January, 2018 Binance was the largest trading platform in the world, Cointelegraph reporting user numbers increasing by 240,000 per hour and restrictions being placed on new sign-ups. Despite a ���slowdown��� in the complex procedures used to facilitate the upgrade, Zhao assured users on social media that the integrity of data was not at risk at any point. ���There was a DDoS attack on our cloud provider, resolved, but still some lingering effects,��� he added in a further recent twitter update. The exchange had managed to refute accusations a hack was taking place as the technical issues unfolded Thursday, Feb. 8.	2
When looking across the globe, there were plenty of strong performing equity markets in 2017. Nevertheless, none compare to the massive appreciation seen within the cryptocurrency sector. Warning: If you are primarily an equity investor, you may soon be compelled to enter the world of cryptocurrencies as the relative outperformance of the top cryptocurrencies in 2017, when compared to equity markets, was astronomical. The top-performing stock market last year (excluding Venezuela with a 3,884 percent gain due to rampant inflation) was Zimbabwe with a 117.7 percent advance, while the top cryptocurrency Ripple, left Zimbabwe in the dust with an eye-popping 28,963 percent return. Ripple ended 2016 at $0.0065 and by Dec. 31, 2017 had risen to $2.25. By the end of 2017 Ripple has overtaken Ethereum as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, at $77.1 bln and $72.9 bln, respectively. Although still far behind Bitcoin���s approximately $248.3 bln market capitalization, they are rising fast. The market capitalization of Ripple is up approximately 31,637 percent from a year ago and Ethereum has increased around 1,300 percent. A distant third is Bitcoin, up 447 percent over the past 12 months. As you can see in the following table, Top Stock Market Performance 2017, relatively high returns came from less developed and emerging stock markets such as Argentina with a 77.7 percent return, Mongolia which rose by 68.9 percent, and Kazakhstan, climbing by 59.3 percent. Of course, for most investors, there are barriers to accessing these stock markets. That may be one of the reason���s global investors have taken a liking to cryptocurrencies as they are global, can be accessed and traded 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  In major developed stock markets, Hong Kong���s Hang Seng Index led the way with a 36 percent return, followed by India���s BSE Sensex 30, up 27.9 percent. The Hang Seng ended December at 29,919.15, close to the high for the year, and the second highest monthly closing price ever, second only to the record high peak from November 2007 of 31,958.41. Since 2009 low the Hang Seng has been progressing higher in an ascending parallel trend channel. The index is now heading towards the top channel line, which will put it in the area to test resistance around the 2007 highs. That���s only 6 percent or so higher. It���s interesting to note that the Hang Seng has only had one down month during 2017, a testament to its strength.  India���s BSE Sensex 30 Index ended the year almost 10 percentage points lower than the Hang Seng, but a strong finish nonetheless. The Sensex had a solid close at a record high of 34,057, very close to the year���s high of 34,127.22. December triggered a monthly bullish trend continuation signal and follows a breakout of a two-year base in May. This is very healthy price behavior and supportive of a continuation of the bullish trend. As long as the Sensex continues to progress with a series of high monthly highs and higher monthly lows, further upside is likely.  The third best performing major stock market index last year was the S&P 500 (SPX), up 19.4 percent to end at 2,674. For the past 13 months the SPX has advanced as much as 29.3 percent, as of the year���s 2,694.97 high, in a sequential series of higher monthly highs and higher monthly lows, all in the face of growing choir of bears, waiting and ready to bounce. This monthly pattern continues to define a strong uptrend. In addition to ending the year technically strong, in the upper third of December���s high-to-low price range, the close was at a new monthly closing high. When measuring the current advance from the February 2016 swing low, the SPX was up as much as 48 percent as of the recent high. Can it keep going? Well, the prior rally (swing low to swing high) on a monthly basis, starting from October 2011, saw the SPX increase as much as 99 percent before moving into a prolonged consolidation base period. So far the advance is approximately half of that. By itself, this would indicate more upside potential. Of course, not all stock markets were bullish last year, but the worst performers were relatively smaller exchanges. The bottom performing market for 2017 was the Sarajevo Stock Exchange. It ended the year down 18.5 percent to close at 562. Coming in second was the Qatar Exchange Index, with a loss of 18.3 percent, followed by the Karachi Stock Exchange Index, which dropped by 15.3 percent. Qatar, of course, has been negatively impacted by an economic blockade since June spearheaded by Saudi Arabia with support from other Arabian Gulf countries.  This next chart shows the performance of the five of the larger cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC/USD). The cryptocurrencies shown in this chart and the accompanying table further down, is not comprehensive and is chosen as a sample of the more popular and widely traded cryptocurrencies. It is interesting to see that the cryptocurrencies shown all started to accelerate higher around early-November, except for Ripple (XRP/USD). Ripple was late to the party but doesn���t seem to be losing any time making up for the slow start. You can see how it has been rising rapidly recently while the other major cryptos start to pullback. For the month of December Ripple has advanced more than 700 percent. The Ripple token is used to facilitate global payments by banks and other financial institutions.  Following the strong performance of Ripple is Dash (DASH/USD). Dash was up at least 9,400 percent for 2017 through Dec. 31. Dash broke out of a 32-month base into new high territory in February and has barely looked back. Over the past 10 months, since the breakout, Dash as advanced as much as 10,584 percent, as of its recent high of $1,595.76 reached in December. So far, since reaching that high, Dash has moved into a pullback, falling as much as 51 percent before bouncing.  Ethereum (ETH/USD) was the third-best performer for the year, up at about 9,000 percent to $757 at Dec 31. It started 2017 very strong, rising over 5,000 percent in the first five months before moving into a four-month or so consolidation phase. A classic symmetrical triangle consolidation pattern formed subsequent to the top. Ethereum broke out of that pattern with conviction in November, rising a little over 100 percent before confronting resistance at $863.0 last decade of December and sliding into a retracement. To date, the retracement has seen as much as a 40 percent loss in value from the high.  In fourth place comes Litecoin (LTC/USD), with a 5,582 percent advance of the year so far. Litecoin has been pulling back over the past couple of weeks, since hitting resistance at a record high of $420.0. That high completed a 735.8 percent increase in only six weeks, starting at the low of a three-week pullback at the beginning of November. The move was accompanied by increasing volume until the top, which is where weekly volume reached a record high.  Let���s now jump to Bitcoin, which comes in sixth place for the year out of the cryptocurrencies selected. Of course, Bitcoin has been the one getting much of the attention in the sector since the summer. It is up 1,390 percent year-to-date and was up as much as 1,935 percent at the record high of $19,666 hit mid-December. Interestingly, the second highest volume week of the past two years was seen in the next week following that record high. That was a down week. Bitcoin had been advancing in a nicely formed parallel trend channel since the first quarter of the year until later in November. At that point, Bitcoin broke out through the top trend line of the channel and began to accelerate higher. This can be seen in the increase in the angle of ascent of price in the following chart.  Going back one to fifth place is Monero (XMR/USD). Monero is up 2,481 percent. It ended 2016 at $5.90 and jumped to at least $348.02 over the subsequent 12 months. This coin has been a steady progression higher throughout the year and recently hit a record high of $477 before pulling back. It remains in a clear uptrend.  IOTA (IOT/USD) takes seventh place with an advance of 1,356 percent since June, when it was launched. The high for 2017 was two weeks ago at $5.80. At the point, IOTA was up over 1,700 percent in just seven weeks. It subsequently declined as much as 80 percent off the high.  Finally, there is Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD), released in August. Since then BCH has risen to $2,553 from $320. It continues to progress in an uptrend with higher swing highs and higher swing lows. It was up as much as 1,150 percent at the recent $4,000.10 high from Dec. 20.	1
FOX News has joined the mainstream networks bullish on Bitcoin, embracing claims it could reach up to $1 bln. In a segment of Making Money June 30, anchor Charles Payne hosted a celebration of Bitcoin, the latest rally of which could see it reach $1 mln ���within the next few years,��� he agreed. ���For the most part we wrote it off as technology���s answer to Beanie Babies,��� Payne began, ���Well, it���s back, and this time this rally feels different.���  FOX joins networks such as CNBC in its newfound love of virtual currency, which until 2017 regularly received derogatory reviews from hosts and experts alike. As Bitcoin circles $2,500 per coin, speculating over its price within five or ten years has become a new favorite sport of finance media looking to get investors excited. ���The reason Bitcoin is a financial revolution is because it���s decentralized,��� Payne���s guest Naomi Brockwell, former policy director at the New York Bitcoin Center said. ���The main people promoting this technology are those who understand that governments can be dangerous.��� Taking the current financial crisis in Venezuela, where Bitcoin is providing a genuine lifeline to those who would otherwise not be able to purchase essential goods, Brockwell added the future of the cryptocurrency could only be brighter. ���It���s going to the moon,��� she concluded. By the end of the segment, the $1 mln price forecast had meanwhile become $1 bln, albeit with no sources referenced.	2
Binance will welcome migration and offer support to projects from the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem following this month���s unraveling of the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and its algorithmic stablecoin. BNB Chain (BNB) has committed to providing investment and support to projects that are considering migrating from the Terra ecosystem in the wake of the biggest black swan event to hit the cryptocurrency space in recent years. Stader Labs will become one of the first Terra ecosystem projects to begin integrating with the BNB Chain. The firm builds liquid staking solutions across four blockchains, namely Solana (SOL), Near (NEAR), Fantom (FTM) and Hedera (HBAR), and is set to offer BNB liquid staking through a newly announced partnership. Users will be able to stake BNB in Stader and receive yields through the platform, while the firm will also issue a staking derivative representing the staked BNB holdings, which users can then use in DeFi protocols.  TheBNB Chain Fund offers access to $1 billion in investment and grants to prospective projects looking to operate within the BNB Chain ecosystem. The team is committed to supporting projects migrating from the Terra ecosystem and will provide added network, tokenomics and marketing support as well as business development. Gwendolyn Regina, BNB Chain���s investment director, spoke to Cointelegraph about the move to support ailing projects from the Terra ecosystem. While the potential for the ecosystem to recover is subject to much speculation, Regina said the firm was looking to onboard some important builders from the Terra ecosystem: Regina also confirmed that a handful of projects within the Terra ecosystem had been interacting with the BNB Chain before its collapse including Mirror Protocol, Synapse, and Wormhole. Of particular interest to BNB Chain are firms working in emerging sectors of the crypto-economy ��� a space in which Terra developers were gaining momentum, according to Regina: Binance is not the only cryptocurrency firm offering help to beleaguered projects within the Terra ecosystem. Telos also announced support of developers and projects within the Terra ecosystem this week and will work to fast track migrations of decentralized applications, or DApps, that were operating in the Terra ecosystem ��� including investment, marketing support and technical assistance.

A veteran miner has cracked open their 2010 stash of Bitcoin, with crypto analysts spotting 100 BTC being transferred from two wallets that had laid dormant for more than a decade. Prior to today���s transaction, the addresses had not seen any activity since receiving a 50 BTC Coinbase reward each nearly 11 years ago, except for two incoming transactions worth just 0.00000547 BTC each that were sent to the wallets in the last six months.  The Feb. 25 transaction combined the two mining address outputs, indicating both addresses belong to the same owner. The two blocks were mined only a couple of hours apart on Jun. 10, 2010.  Bitcoin is currently trading for $49,800, giving the coins a combined value of nearly $5 million. With BTC trading for $0.08 when the coins were mined, the whale���s holdings have increased in value by 622,500 times. Some old coins moved today (100 BTC from June 2010).It's very rare to see pre-GPU era bitcoins move, it only happened dozens of times in the past few years.And no, it's probably not Satoshi. pic.twitter.com/0jZXnmWUes About half of the coins were moved to a wallet belonging to German peer-to-peer exchange Bitcoin.de, which has been in operation since 2011. For now, the remaining coins are sitting in a newly created legacy address.  Forked altcoins such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) have not yet been peeled from the BTC. The coins, mined in blocks 60365 and 60385, are unlikely to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, who is suggested to have mined at least 1.1 million BTC. The movement of 2010 era coins is an uncommon occurrence, with researchers identifying just 18 transactions involving BTC with inputs from July 2010 or before in 2021 so far. In May 2020, 50 Bitcoin moved from a 2009 mining address, triggering excited speculation the BTC may have belonged to Satoshi.	1
The second day of the BlockShow Europe 2018 conference kicked off with a keynote speech by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. Wales said that cryptocurrency and blockchain are ���in a bubble��� Tuesday, May 29. Speaking as part of a presentation on the objective future of crypto assets versus their representation in the press, the veteran internet entrepreneur delivered frank words about the nascent industry. ���I think this is a space where we���re in serious need of real journalism,��� he began. ���...Right now, we are in a bubble, the cryptoworld is absolutely, definitely in a bubble. I don���t think there���s many people who would deny that.���  His comments come as Bitcoin prices continue deflating, hitting lows of $7050 May 28 while so far maintaining support above $7000, something commentators nevertheless this week doubted would last. Wales echoed broader skepticism of blockchain projects surfacing in the past weeks. Both Andreas Antonopoulos at a Polish conference earlier this month, along with Bitcoin developers Jimmy Song and Johnathan Corgan at the Consensus 2018 conference delivered damning blockchain versus bitcoin verdicts. This week, even the Chinese government determined the average lifespan of a blockchain project was just 15 months. ���I���m not here to tell you that it���ll pop tomorrow; things might get even more intense first,��� Wales meanwhile continued. ���The thing about bubbles is that you never know when they���re going to end��� it might pop tomorrow, but more importantly, it will pop.���	0
Essentially, the mysterious nature of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's creator, means that the entire ecosystem is sitting on a potential volcano. It lays dormant at the moment, but if the creator had the inkling, he could flood the market with one mln coins and destroy its value. One of the biggest mysteries in the technology world is the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows who he is, where he is or what he is doing with his millions. That is millions, as in millions of Bitcoins as it has been reasonably estimated that Nakamoto could own over one mln coins. Matt Green, a cryptocurrency professor at Johns Hopkins University, says Nakamoto has the power to tank the currency if he wants to. Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 mln which is expected to be reached by the year 2140. Nakamoto's one mln Bitcoins amount to five percent of the entire cryptocurrency. "The thing about Bitcoin is if you control a million of them, you have the ability to flood the market at any point. Think of them as rare baseball cards. They're valuable because they're rare. If somebody could dump hundreds or thousands of Mickey Mantle trading cards, rare ones, onto the market, they wouldn't be worth so much anymore," said Green. Nakamoto has really gone undercover since he decided to pull away from his creation, and for a man with such high value, his influence has not even been noted among the pseudo-anonymous Bitcoin network. However, if Nakamoto were to put his coins up for sale, the entire market would be flooded, and the Bitcoin price would tank. While Nakamoto remains a sleeping giant and a potential dormant volcano, he is no threat or promise to the Bitcoin Network. However, he is still an extremely significant figure in the digital currency's future. Ben Yu, a Bitcoin investor living in San Francisco, says Nakamoto's stake in Bitcoin is extremely significant. "If Bitcoin fulfills its role of becoming a global currency, then Satoshi Nakamoto would likely be the richest person in the world and also hold a proportionately higher share of the ultimate supply of Bitcoin than something like the US government holds in gold today," said Yu. Yu's math works out. The US government holds the most gold reserves of any other entity in the world, at about 8,000 tonnes. That's a little over four percent of the world's total supply, less than Nakamoto's five percent stake in Bitcoin.	1
Crypto markets are on an upswing today, July 16, as data from Coin360 shows, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming the $6,600 price point. Today���s notable market growth is likely bolstered by news that the $6.3 trillion asset management heavyweight BlackRock ������ the world���s largest provider of exchange traded-funds (ETF) ������ is beginning to assess potential involvement in Bitcoin, according to reports from Financial News.  Market visualization from Coin360 Today���s solid market gains are poised to turn around negative momentum that has thwarted price performance since market descent that began July 10. Yesterday saw the first signs of a budding positive trend, and as of today, virtually all of the top 100 coins by market cap are seeing significant growth on the day to press time. Bitcoin is trading around $6,607, up a little over 4 percent over the 24-hour period to press time. The top cryptocurrency gained over $200 in the space of a few hours this morning, hitting a peak of $6,635 before falling slightly to its current position. Bitcoin is still down around one and a half percent on the week, yet to top its outstanding rally July 8 when the coin hit almost $6,800.  Bitcoin price chart July 16. Source: Cointelegraph Bitcoin Price Index Leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $474 to press time, up over 6 percent over the past 24 hours to press time. The coin���s strong ascent has not yet brought its mid-term price performance back into net positive territory, with its weekly and monthly losses still at 1.25 and 4.8 percent respectively. Following Bitcoin���s spike, Ethereum also saw a sharp upward turn earlier today, growing about 4.6 percent in two and a half hours to peak at $475, before proceeding to trade sideways to press time, holding today���s gains so far.

Weekly high in the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap Today���s significant news from BlackRock is likely to invigorate the narrative that institutional investors have been biding their time to enter the cryptocurrency markets at an opportune moment. Over the weekend, CNBC trading advisor Ran Neuner went so far as to venture that once the institutional behemoths are in, 2017���s bull run for crypto would come to ���look like a warm-up.��� Ran Neuer has today added today that the indications that BlackRock could now enter the crypto space potentially heralds an ���exciting��� and transformational moment for the markets ������ a position that echoes the long-held view that crypto-based ETFs would be a ���holy grail��� for the crypto industry. In its own bid to provide infrastructure to facilitate institutional entry, major U.S. crypto wallet provider and exchange service Coinbase has said that it expects that such moves ������ rapidly being mirrored across the crypto space ������ will ���unlock��� the ���$10 billion��� of institutional capital that has until now been ���sitting on the sideline.���	2
The trustee of Mt. Gox ��� a once major and now defunct Bitcoin exchange ��� who reportedly sold over $400 mln in Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) around the new year has stated that he does not believe the sales affected the market prices of BTC or BCH, according to a report released today, March 17. Today���s report is a transcript of a Q&A at the 10th Mt. Gox creditors��� meeting, which took place on March 7, 2018, about the selling of BTC and BCH by defunct exchange���s trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi. The Japan-based Mt.Gox crypto exchange had been the largest in the world until a February 2014 hack led to the loss of around 850,000 BTC. The current sales of BTC and BCH by Kobayashi are part of an attempt to refund users who lost money in the hack. An earlier report released March 7 to the Tokyo District Court had said that the BTC/BCH sales took place between the creditors��� meeting in September 2017 and the one on March 7. However the report released today clarifies that the sales took place between December 2017 and January 2018. The March 7 report, which detailed the amount of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash sold by Kobayashi over this reported two month period, led many to believe that the large sell off is what led to the market crash after the new year. Kobayashi noted that after consulting with cryptocurrency experts, he ���sold BTC and BCC [BCH], not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC [BCH] exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible.��� Kobayashi added a clarification about the transfers of BTC and BCH to different addresses, underlining that he did not necessarily sell BTC and BCH at the same time as these transfers: ���Please refrain from analyzing the correlation between the sale of BTC and BCC [BCH] by us and the market prices of BTC and BCC [BCH] based on the assumption that the sale was made at the time the BTC and BCC [BCH] were transferred from BTC/BCC [BCH] addresses that I manage, as such assumption is incorrect.��� It is possible that today���s report was released as a way for Kobayashi to refute accusations of his responsibility in the crash, as many in the crypto community had analyzed the times of the transfers of BTC and BCH in an attempt to correlate them with drops in market price during the same period. However, Cointelegraph did find that a comparison of the transfers and the price showed that there was a negative correlation in the short run, daily. Kobayashi reported that he sold the two coins at what he believes to be a fair market price, and picked the timing of sale ���following consultation with the court.��� Kobayashi also noted that he sold BTC and BCH separately, and added that there is no determination yet on future sales of the remaining BTC and BCH. A recent Reddit post summarizing Kobayashi���s position from today report���s has garnered conflicting opinions. Reddit user riveriafrank commented on the post that ���just because you transact on a dark pool doesnt [sic] mean the price isnt [sic] affected.��� Another Reddit user, samonx, the author of the post, added an alternative explanation for the market dip in the past couple months that does not include Kobayashi: ���Large holders sold at a high price driving the price down on the back of FUD about the 'Tokyo Whale' about to dump 160k more Bitcoin because he's been recklessly selling using market orders. It all turned out to be complete b******* as I suspected. Someone else was dumping and manipulating in this way. Once you start an avalanche there's no way to control it.���	0
Joseph Lubin, co-founder of major cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH), declared that he is ���calling the cryptobottom of 2018��� in a tweet Dec. 21. According to Lubin, the crypto market���s bottom ���is marked by an epic amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt,��� specifically from industry media and social commentators, which he refers to as ���our friends in the 4th and crypto-5th estates.��� Continuing in a Twitter thread, the founder of Ethereum blockchain-focused software firm ConsenSys then evidently addressed his firms recently reported major layoffs: ���ConsenSys remains healthy and is engaging in a rebalancing of priorities and activities which started about nine months ago.��� He stated that Consensys continues investing in projects ��� in its role as a blockchain tech incubator and venture firm ��� and hiring for internal projects that ���remain core to our forward looking-business.��� In the same thread, Lubin complained about ���an epic amount of conjecture and preemptive paranoia��� concerning ���situations journalists and bloggers don't have real data for, actual insight into, or understanding of.��� Concluding, Lubin reiterated his optimism about the future of ConsenSys and Ethereum, stating: ���The sky is not falling. From my perspective the future looks very bright. [...] Peaking [sic] into 2019, if you could see the landscape through my eyes, you'd have to wear shades.��� Reports surfaced this week ��� citing sources familiar with the matter ��� that ConsenSys is spinning out startups it previously backed, some of them without financial support. The sources reported that the number of employees to be laid off could be anywhere between 50 and 60 percent of ConsenSys��� 1,200 person workforce. This past week, Cointelegraph reported that in comparison to more significant job cuts in various industries globally, the current slump in the cryptocurrency markets and ensuring job cuts in associated companies seem relatively benign. In September, Ethereum���s other co-founder Vitalik Buterin had pointed out that there is no chance that the cryptocurrency and blockchain space will see ���1,000-times growth��� again.	0
If it hadn���t been for a massive price correction in the week leading up to Christmas, another big price prediction for Bitcoin in 2018 wouldn���t be hard to believe. However, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies saw big drops in market capitalization due to a number of factors and lofty predictions seemed unfathomable in the wake of a massive drop in value. Considering that the markets have now consolidated and the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum have recovered well - it���s fitting that we revisit some targets set by the likes of Moas, who has delivered some reliable, well-informed valuations in 2017. Speaking to Cointelegraph last week in an exclusive profile interview, Moas explained why he believes Bitcoin is destined to become the most valuable currency in the world. The 50-year-old is confident it will eventually surpass China and Gold in terms of market capitalization: ���Bitcoin would have to jump 20x from where it is now to hit that number one spot. That would put its valuation at around $6 tln, which is near where Gold and China are right now.��� ���Why do I think Bitcoin deserves the same valuation as gold? It���s very simple, I don���t know how much Gold there is in the ground, But I know how much Bitcoin there is, and I also know that if the current pace continues with one to two mln people around the world opening up new crypto accounts. We will have a few hundred million people by this time two years from now trying to get their hands on a few million Bitcoin that are available.��� Another driving factor in Moas��� 2018 prediction is the actual supply of Bitcoin. A recent study estimated that nearly four mln Bitcoin are lost forever - accounting for over 20 percent of the coins mined to this day. That isn���t counting bullish investors that ���hodl��� their Bitcoin: ���The number (of Bitcoin available) is a lot lower than what people think it is. A lot of the Bitcoin has been lost, some of it hasn���t been mined and then you have a lot of people like myself that just won���t sell their Bitcoin at any price.��� So where does that leave Moas in terms of a price target in 2018? To understand how he goes about putting a price on the virtual currency, we need to understand where he started in the first place: ���My feeling all along is that Bitcoin is going to hit the top of the mountain. As far as my price targets go, I started out with a $50,000 target back in July - we were at $2,570 at the time. Had I told people where I really thought it was going at the time, they would have thought I was on drugs. You can���t put out $200-300,000 target on something when it���s trading at $2,570, people just won���t take you seriously.��� ���So what I did was put my target out, and every few weeks as news comes out, and the obstacles and dominoes in Bitcoin���s path get knocked down, I adjust my price target.��� Moas has drawn a line in the sand already: ���My target for 2018 is $28,000 and it may get upgraded again in the next few months.��� Taking Bitcoin at its present value around means that a lot of ground needs to be made if it is going to meet Moas��� expectation in the next 12 months. However, the top-rated stock picker points to the favorable reaction to the launch of Bitcoin futures contracts and the ramifications and future prospects of mass-adoption by Wall Street. ���A lot of people don���t realize that everything I learned in my 20 years in the stock market has translated into the crypto market and it puts me in a unique situation to understand what is going on right now.��� ���People that don���t understand how financial markets work have probably already exited Bitcoin after it doubled, tripled and quadrupled.��� Moas insists that people should not sell their Bitcoin and treat it like bullish investors treated Amazon over the years. ���In the last 15 years, Amazon went from 20 dollars to $1,150, even though people were trying to short it the entire time, arguing that this company was not worth what it was trading at because up until a few years ago Amazon was losing money on every single book they sold. There were some people that just didn���t understand how this thing was being valued so they bet against it and they got their heads handed to them on a plate.��� Aiming his sights at Bitcoin bears that have now entered the market, Moas warned that they could get burned if they try to short the market. ���That is what will happen to the people that try to bet against Bitcoin. That���s why I���m not worried about what is going on in the futures market. The futures market is basically a stamp of approval on crypto and it legitimises crypto as a new asset class. There will be a little bit of extra volatility now that CME and CBOE are involved but once Wall Street enters the arena, the floodgates will open.��� If you missed our feature on Moas, check it out here.	2
Golem Network has launched an app that allows users to mine Ether (ETH) on their laptops, but it could be a long time before riches can be reaped. The decentralized computing resources sharing platform released the Thorg app that allows users to mine Ether on Windows-based PCs and laptops. The app runs in the background and harnesses unused computing power to process the calculations required for proof-of-working mining. Users are rewarded in Golem���s native GLM token, however, and not ETH. The system runs on layer-two aggregator Polygon, which alleviates any heavy transaction fees associated with the ERC-20 GLM token. It creates ���shares,��� which are batched computing tasks that are collected and used to mine Ether. Golem CEO Piotr Janiuk said that Thorg was designed to increase adoption of Golem Network by allowing users to earn passive income on their own computers. The minimum requirements for running the app are the Windows 10 operating system, and a 6 gigabyte or greater graphics card, which only high-end gaming laptops will have. Those thinking that this could be an easy way to make a mint by mining at home may have to think again. A 6GB graphics card will produce a hash rate of around 26 megahashes per second, according to review websites. Taking this and average desktop PC power consumption of around 600 watts into consideration for a hypothetical example, profits from mining Ether on a PC could yield around $0.06 per day, or take more than a fortnight to make $1, according to mining calculators. There are many variables, however, such as the specific computer hardware, power consumption and cost of electricity, so this is just one theoretical example, and results may vary.  The calculations also do not account for the cost of high-end graphics cards, which are extremely expensive at the moment due to the demand and global chip shortage. The announcement did state that a high-end GPU was not necessary for all users. At the time of writing, Golem���s native token was trading down 1.5% on the day at $0.475 according to CoinGecko. GLM is currently down 64% from its $1.32 all-time high in April 2018.	0
Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, presented a Blockchain scaling solution called Plasma Cash, an even ���more scalable��� version of an existing solution called Plasma, during a talk live streamed on YouTube at the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris on Friday, March 9. Plasma Cash was developed by Buterin and developers Dan Robinson and Karl Floersch. Plasma itself is an on-chain scaling solution for Blockchains, introduced by Buterin and Lightning Network creator Joseph Poon in August 2017. Plasma works by optimizing data that is passed onto the root Blockchain, reducing the transaction fees for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The problems with the scalability of Plasma, according to Buterin, is that every user must download and authenticate each Plasma block, which prevents exponential scaling. To explain the Plasma Cash model, Buterin gives the example that if a user deposits some amount of ether to a crypto exchange or any third party service, a Plasma coin would be created with the same value of ether and a unique ID that cannot be merged or split. In contrast with Plasma, Plasma Cash would only require users to pay attention to the blocks that contain coins they want to keep track of: ���A user actually only needs to verify the availability and correctness of the Plasma chain only [���] at the specific index of the coin, of any coins that they own and any coins that they care about.��� As for the current practical applications of Plasma Cash, Buterin sees a possibility for crypto exchanges to take advantage of the technology to make themselves more ���hack resistant���.   Since each Plasma coin has an owner, the coins are not fully fungible or interchangeable: no one can take another user���s coin without the owner of the coin being alerted. In this case, the coin���s owner would prevent the potential fraudulent withdrawal through the ���complaint system��� by showing their ���proof data��� for their coin���s history. Buterin notes that even if a hack occurs on an exchange using Plasma Cash, users will not lose their money: ���Regardless of what happens in the exchange, users can run their money through the Plasma exit procedure and get their money out.��� Buterin ends his talk with a positive prognosis for the future use of Plasma Cash: ���Whenever the next big multi-billion dollar exchange written by a totally incompetent developer gets hacked, no one will lose any money.��� Segregated Witness (SegWit), a scalability solution for Bitcoin (BTC), has recently been implemented across a variety of crypto exchanges. The Bitfinex exchange announced the implementation of SegWit on Feb. 20, and the crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase announced their SegWit implementation on Feb. 23. The Bitcoin Core client version, which fully supports SegWit technology, was officially released on Feb. 26.	2
Cointelegraph has learned that crypto hedge fund Adaptive Capital, will shutter all operations after taking heavy losses during the March 13 crypto market meltdown which saw Bitcoin (BTC) price drop to a 2020 low at $3,775. As first reported by The Block, the fund has issued a letter to its investors announcing the closure of the fund and the return of all remaining assets to investors. The hedge fund had previously reported gains over 552.77% from October 3, 2018, through May 3, 2019. The letter to investors is said to cite a series of infrastructural problems with a trading venue as the primary cause of the losses. Although the venue hasn���t been named in Adaptive Capitals��� letter to investors, BitMex was inoperational for almost an hour during the massive sell-off, leaving the hedge fund operators unable to respond to the market.   BitMex has since reported on this and has blamed a DDoS attack for the down period.  ���We have identified the root cause of two DDoS attacks at 02:16 UTC and 12:56 UTC, 13 March 2020. For a full account of what happened and how we are responding.��� Since dropping from $10,500, Bitcoin���s price action had already taken a bearish slant and the digital asset���s positive trend seems to have been broken on Feb. 26, when the daily candle failed to gain above $9,200. This completed a head and shoulders pattern and was followed by a strong downside move for Bitcoin.  BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingView The bloodbath that ensued was unpredictable as no one, including Adaptive Capital, seemed to expect a devaluation of around 50%, leaving Bitcoin near $3,775, a price point that hasn���t been seen since April last year. Like many institutional investors, Adaptive Capital likely had the longer Bitcoin���s price action on  longer timeframes in mind. Proof of this comes from an August 2019 tweet from Murad Mahmudov, former Goldman Sachs analyst and the Chief Investment Officer at Adaptive Capital.  In the tweet Mahmudov showed just how bullish he was by predicting a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin in the long-run: ���At first glance this looks like a weak chop for the next week or so, but my intuition tells me there is steady accumulation happening at these levels. Don't try to outsmart yourself on short timeframes, zoom out & think big. In my view, BTC is going to $100K per orangecoin.��� Crypto Funds gained popularity with crypto and traditional finance investors, especially in 2018, fueling many of the companies and projects available today. These typically range from hedge funds like Alliance Capital to venture capital funds like the Digital Currency Group.  It is not uncommon to see traditional venture capital firms delve into crypto which shows some level of institutional demand for cryptocurrencies. In a report published in May 2019, PwC estimated that in 2018 150 active crypto hedge funds collectively managed $1 billion in assets, and despite the negative performance of many new and ambitious crypto hedge funds are still being created, although the number of new funds has now decreased by more than half in 2019 compared to the year before. Despite signals of institutional demand for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, this has failed to materialize in 2019 and hedge funds can only take so many losses before they throw in the towel. According to a December 2018 report from Crypto Fund Research nearly 70 crypto hedge funds have shut down. In the meantime, exchange traded funds continue to see rejections from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amid concerns that the Bitcoin market is simply too prone to manipulation. Most recently, the SEC rejected another ETF submission by Wilshire Phoenix. The NY-based firm was hoping to hedge against Bitcoin���s volatility by including US Treasury bonds in the basket.  As the current Coronavirus situation unfolds, it is hard to say how hedge funds and other market players will cope but as even traditional safe-haven assets like gold continue to fail, Bitcoin may find itself in completely new territory as an emerging asset class.  Whether that is good or bad, it���s left to be seen but members of Adaptive Capital remain bullish nonetheless. Earlier this week, Willy Woo, partner at Adaptive Capital and self-described ���pioneer in on-chain analytics��� tweeted:  ���Dump then moon. We are undergoing flight to safety right now, BTC is looking for its bottom. But know that once the bottom is in there are strong bullish pressures ahead. It's this economic environment in the years ahead that Bitcoin was built for.���	0
Ethereum���s visionary co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has commented on the obstacles on the roadmap to Ethereum 2.0 at a conference in Hong Kong. Speaking partly in Mandarin at the Virtual Fintech Forum at this week���s StartmeupHK Festival 2021, Buterin said that technology wasn���t the major issue with the world���s largest smart contract network. He admitted that building Ethereum has taken a lot more time than he had anticipated, with early Eth1 blockchain build estimates of around three months turning into 18 months in reality. The upgraded version is taking substantially longer. Buterin added that there had been a number of internal team conflicts in the five years it has taken Ethereum to get to where it is today. ���One of the biggest problems I���ve found with our project is not the technical problems ��� it���s problems related with people,��� he said. The comments came in a fireside chat with Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic. Buterin stated that Eth2 will be able to have the kind of scalability that the large-scale enterprise applications expect when rollups and sharding are combined. However, that is unlikely to occur before late 2022 per the latest roadmap estimates.  The two chains will merge, or dock, in late 2021 or early 2022, according to the official documentation, which states: Phase One, which introduces scalability through sharding, is not expected until later in 2022 at this stage.  Buterin said the current version of Ethereum has largely become a victim of its own success, with demand pushing network fees to record levels, making the majority of transactions economically unviable for the average user. On the topic of Eth2, Buterin said that they are using that moniker less frequently because the team wanted to emphasize that ���this isn���t throwing out the existing Ethereum platform and making a totally new one. It���s a much more, kind of, incremental set of changes.��� The upgrade to proof-of-stake has become even more urgent recently with all of the negativity and FUD surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) and its power consumption. The proof-of-work Ethereum blockchain consumes the energy equivalent of Hong Kong, according to Digiconomist. Comparatively, the new proof-of-stake network will use around 99.95% less energy.	1
Yesterday IOTA announced a major platform release allowing data monetization using micropayments through their distributed ledger technology. The data solution has already garnered huge partnerships from Microsoft, Fujitsu, Bosch, Deutsche Bank Telekom, and others. IOTA has already issued its tokens of the same name under their token sale earlier this fall. The company has created what it considers a better option in Blockchain technology evolution called ���tangle.��� Through this system, the company is creating a way for connected devices to be able to transfer, buy and sell diverse datasets while creating access to data that often sits unused, all with substantial security. A demo of the platform is scheduled to run through January and will be a way for companies to participate in the innovation. Partners will also be able to influence how the platform continues to function. IOTA co-founder David S��nsteb�� said: ���The goal is to enable a combination of a business-to-business data economy, as well as enabling researchers and even hobbyists to participate. The beauty of enabling fine-granular trade access is that we really don't know who or how it will be used, except that we know it is a completely new paradigm.��� The hope is that the structure of IOTA���s tangle technology, without miners or mining fees, will allow large-scale proliferation of micro-payments for datasets, providing access to data and building a network for companies to use and access that data for improvements to the Internet of Things (IoT).	2
The announcement by CME that it plans to launch Bitcoin futures has resulted in a spike in interest across the world. Coinbase, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, has added 100,000 new users in the 24 hours past the announcement. Coinbase is a popular exchange to buy Bitcoins with 11.9 mln users supported across 32 countries. It was one of the earliest exchanges to support Bitcoin trading in the Western world, doing so when Bitcoin was valued in single digits. It supports merchants as well, allowing them to accept Bitcoins for their products and services, but removing the price risk by crediting fiat currency to their accounts. Coinbase became the first unicorn of the crypto industry after it raised $100 mln in August 2017, implying enterprise valuation of $1.6 bln. The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, is also on Fortune���s 40 under 40 list. The launch of Bitcoin futures by CME is expected to bring a deluge of institutional money into Bitcoin. Individual investors seem to be stampeding towards Bitcoin exchanges, trying to get their hands on Bitcoins before institutional investors make it out of reach. According to data compiled by Alistair Milne, of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, over 100,000 new users have joined Coinbase in the 24 hours since the CME announcement. The exploding Bitcoin price has resulted in a sharp increase in the number of users of Coinbase, which has already doubled in 2017 to reach 11.9 mln users. With hundreds of thousands of new users, the demand (and price) of Bitcoin is expected to eventually explode. It is estimated that currently less than 0.5 percent of the global population is invested in crypto space. While Coinbase has insurance protection for cryptocurrencies saved on its servers, questions will be asked about the robustness of its trading platform. A flash crash caused by a large order on Coinbase���s GDAX exchange resulted in Ethereum's price dropping to 10 cents for a short period of time, triggering stop loss orders. With increasing number of users, it is not just Bitcoin which is running full blocks and has a scalability problem; Bitcoin exchanges have to scale up too.	2
Bitcoin (BTC) proponents are voicing fresh alarm after the United States Federal Reserve printed more than its entire market cap in new money this month. As noted by cryptocurrency social media pundit Dennis Parker on Oct. 21, since mid-September, the Fed has injected $210 billion into the economy.  Part of its newly-revitalized quantitative easing (QE) strategy, the move dwarfs the total market cap of Bitcoin, which stands at $148 billion.  QE refers to the buying up of government bonds in order to provide economic stimulus. The Fed���s balance sheet, Parker notes, jumped from $3.77 trillion last month to $3.97 trillion. It had previously been higher, while the Fed���s own projections call for a balance sheet worth $4.7 trillion by 2025.  For holders of assets that cannot have their supply inflated, such as gold and Bitcoin, money printing has regularly sparked calls to decrease reliance on fiat currency.  Parker���s suggestion that investors should buy BTC now came amid warnings from even the fiat establishment itself about the ailing health of the banking system.  In a speech at the International Monetary Fund���s general meeting last week, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King told attendees the world was ���sleepwalking��� into a financial crisis even worse than that of 2008. ���By sticking to the new orthodoxy of monetary policy and pretending that we have made the banking system safe, we are sleepwalking towards that crisis,��� he summarized. The concept that interventionist economic practices on the part of governments and central banks leads to financial destruction forms one of the central tenets of Saifedean Ammous��� ���The Bitcoin Standard.���  Released in March 2018, the book focuses on Bitcoin as it compares to fiat currency and commodities such as gold.  As Cointelegraph noted, at ten years old, Bitcoin has now lasted 40% of the average fiat currency���s lifespan.	1
Bitcoin has surpassed the market cap of General Electric, which was once the largest company in the world, by $30 bln. At $160 billion, Bitcoin's market cap just passed GE's.   Yes, that GE:  Founded in 1892  Once the largest company in the world  295,000 employees  $123 billion in revenue$BTC.X $GE pic.twitter.com/XDqjW2l5Ns GE, with a $123 bln annual revenue and 295,000 employees globally, still remains as a leading US-based conglomerate. In July of 2016, the market valuation of GE briefly surpassed $300 bln, nearing the market cap of other major firms like JPMorgan. But, since 2015, GE has struggled, as its market cap fell by nearly 50 percent. Meanwhile, since 2015, the market cap of Bitcoin has increased from $2.5 bln to $185 bln, by 74-fold. As a store of value and a digital currency, the market valuation of Bitcoin should rather be compared to other assets, stores of value and currencies such as gold and reserve currencies. But, it is important to acknowledge the rapid growth rate of Bitcoin in comparison to companies in leading industries because the transformation Bitcoin has brought upon the finance industry has been truly impactful. Bitcoin has surpassed leading currencies on the M1 index as well this year. This week for instance, the market valuation of Bitcoin surpassed the total money supply of the British pound. Many experts and analysts including billionaire hedge fund legend Mike Novogratz have stated that Bitcoin price could easily reach $40,000 by the end of 2018, or $1 tln in market cap. Novogratz said: "Bitcoin could be at $40,000 at the end of 2018. It easily could. There's a big wave of money coming, not just here but all around the world. What's different about these coins than other commodities ... there is no supply response here. So it's a speculator's dream in that as buying happens there's no new supply response that comes up. So every price move gets exaggerated. It's going to get exaggerated on the way up. There will be 50 percent corrections. It will get exaggerated on the way down.��� As Bitcoin price enters the $45,000 range and the market cap of the cryptocurrency achieves $1 tln, analysts will begin to compare Bitcoin with conventional safe haven assets such as gold. Currently, the entire Bitcoin market is about three percent of the multi-trillion dollar gold market. But, if Bitcoin continues to increase in value and reaches $40,000 by the end of 2018 as noted by Novogratz, it will soon be able to compete against the gold market and other stores of value such as reserve currencies.	2
��ryptocurrencies are one of the most challenging asset classes for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), according to a statement by Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo. He also warned potential investors about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The chairman of the CFTC highly commended his Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) counterparts for raising awareness and encouraging market participants and investors to be wary and "recognize [their] risks and legal responsibilities��� in the crypto space. Giancarlo further says: "I have said consistently that virtual currencies are unlike any commodity that the CFTC has dealt with in the past, and I know they pose challenges for the SEC as well.��� Giancarlo confirmed that both agencies are in regular communication regarding both digital currencies and ICOs, highlighting the degree of inter-agency cooperation within the US regulatory environment. He further clarified that his agency cannot directly regulate cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have even established the Joint CFTC-SEC Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues to develop recommendations on new and ongoing issues relating to both agencies. The establishment of the Joint Committee was one of the 20 recommendations included in the agencies' harmonization report issued in 2009. In his most recent statement, Giancarlo further declares: ���The relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for Bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority.��� In his statement this week, the Chairman of the SEC said that ICOs may potentially be a positive tool, but must be regulated to keep investors safe -- a task his agency has vowed take on in full force.	1
Telegram creators Pavel and Nikolai Durov have filed a ���Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities��� with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Feb. 13, reporting $850 mln raised under the SEC exemption Rule 506(c) from 81 investors for ���the development of the TON Blockchain, the development and maintenance of Telegram Messenger.��� The type of securities offered in the SEC filing are described as ���Purchase Agreements for Cryptocurrency���, and are filed under the Rule 506(c) exemption that means that US citizens who invest must be accredited investors ��� those worth more than $1 mln or that have an annual income of $200,000 ��� in order for the tokens to not have to be registered with the SEC as securities. The Eastman Kodak Company, which had announced the launch of their own ICO under the same exemption in early January, 2018, has postponed their ICO to take more time to verify their investors��� accredited status. The date of the first sale for the Durovs��� ICO is noted as Jan. 29 of this year. By filing with the SEC, the Durovs are preparing to allow for US citizens to legally invest in their project, and implying that US citizens may in fact be some of the 81 investors. Although the SEC filing did not contain the names of any investors in the Durov���s securities offering, Russian news outlet Vedomosti revealed today the names of some of the largest alleged investors, citing inside sources. Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who purportedly has already invested in cryptocurrencies, reportedly was one of the first Russian citizens to be approved to invest in the project. One source allegedly close to the billionaire told Vedomosti that Abramovich had invested as much as $300 mln, however another source claimed the sum was closer to $20 mln. Sergei Solonin, CEO of Russian payment service provider QIWI, invested $17 mln, Vedomosti writes. David Yakobashvili, co-founder of Russian-based dairy product company Wimm-Bill-Dann, told the publication that invested $10 mln in the project. A Telegram ICO has been rumored to be in the making since December 2017, when a former Telegram employee wrote online that Telegram would be launching their own Blockchain platform and cryptocurrency, called either ���The Open Network��� or ���Telegram Open Network��� (TON). A white paper, alleging to be for TON, was leaked in mid-January, but its authenticity has yet to be confirmed publicly by the Durov brothers. The Durov���s SEC filing notes two issuers of securities, TON Issuers Inc. and Telegram Group Inc., both located in the British Virgin Islands. Under the ���Related persons��� section of the filing, Pavel Durov is listed as Executive Officer and Director, while his brother Nikolai is just listed as Executive Officer. A source familiar with the TON funding told Vedomosti that the funding process was not conducted as an ICO in the ���usual sense���,  in which a project���s tokens are purchased for other cryptocurrency, usually either Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).  Instead, the source claims, it was more like a ���closed allocation of securities in ordinary [fiat] currency --dollars and euros.���   According to the same source, and in line with the brothers��� SEC filing, investors bought rights to the internal cryptocurrency of TON, called ���Grams���, which will be distributed to them once the platform is launched.	1
It should come as no surprise that the executives at the top of the banking world are taking notice of cryptocurrencies and the power and success of Blockchain-based financial models. One such executive is Mike McGovern, the new head of Investor Services Fintech Offerings at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, among America���s oldest private banks. McGovern said, "When looking at Bitcoin Blockchain versus Ethereum, there's no doubt Ethereum is superior. It doesn't cost as much to mine Ether tokens because it requires less electricity than Bitcoin. Ethereum is not only cheaper than Bitcoin, it is also more robust and has more applications outside of simply financial transactions such as represent virtual shares, assets, proof of membership, and more..��� McGovern���s comments are also reflective of the bank���s financial decisions, as they have been following and investing in Ethereum over the past five years. Other capital companies are doing the same, like MGT Capital who has begun mining Ethereum for profit. Ethereum has maintained it���s price point with Bitcoin, even though the volatility has increased over the past month. In spite of price fluctuations and some apparently nefarious trading, the cryptocurrency continues to maintain its popularity.	1
Chase Bank CEO Jamie Dimon recently rejected Bitcoin as a ���fraud,��� likely causing additional sell offs after the news of the Chinese exchange ban was released. The financial guru commented that Bitcoin was in a bubble not unlike the famous Tulip bubble during the 17th century. However, in a somewhat surprising move, JP Morgan purchased a large block of Bitcoins just after the CEO���s harsh criticisms, according to a careful observer on Twitter. We see you @jpmorgan $btc pic.twitter.com/tDSVLNHnmi The user 'I am Nomad��� posted the tweet including a screen shot of the BTC chart with the JP Morgan Chase purchase circled. There has been some commentary by industry insiders that banks have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin fail, even while they are seeking to join the upswing in potential profits. Chase bank is no different, apparently, based on the information which has recently come to light. Growing mainstream financial acceptance of the cryptocurrency, including widespread increase in hedge funds and institutional investors would indicate that the predictions of Jamie Dimon and other bears may not be sound.	2
Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has quietly turned its platform into a private members-only club -- new users now require ���invitation codes��� to open an account. However, in a Kafkian twist, the exchange has not mentioned the change or provided any information about where to obtain a code. When a new user goes to sign up on the site, they are shown an ���Invitation Code��� field that, according to the description, was added ���due to extraordinary demand.���  - The sign up window on Bitfinex as of December 19, 2017 Since the exchange suddenly started requiring invitation codes without any official announcement, confused users are taking to Reddit in search of information on how to obtain a code. One enterprising user even created a site that promises to post Bitfinex invitation codes as soon as they appear, meanwhile providing a referral code to an alternative exchange. So far, there is no public indication that any new user has successfully registered since the exchange started requiring registration codes. Huge price surges in both Bitcoin and altcoin markets have seen a second influx of mainstream consumers into the cryptocurrency space after the phenomenon first occurred earlier this year. Overwhelmed exchanges appear to be still unable to cope with demand despite reports of infrastructure and human resource improvements. Bitfinex was advertising for staff as of Dec. 15th, calling for help to ���create the most innovative & industry-leading cryptocurrency exchange.��� According to their Twitter, Bitfinex is also currently also contending with an extensive DDoS attack on its servers. Last week, the exchange warned users of a coordinated telephone scam duping consumers into handing over account information.	1
China has long been a cryptocurrency mining stronghold due to low power tariffs and many large mining operations have set up shop nearby power stations. It seems this theme is spilling over to Russia, where the first instance of power stations being bought by investors to house cryptocurrency mining operations is being reported. According to RT, Russian businessman Aleksey Kolesnik has all but confirmed buying two power stations for cryptocurrency mining operations in the future - citing a report from local newspaper Kommersant. The two power plants based in Perm and Udmurtia, regions roughly 1,200 km East of Moscow, will be refurbished into a data center and mining operation. Kolesnik paid around $3 mln for the two power stations - although its uncertain if and when the plans to start mining cryptocurrency will go ahead. The credibility of the project and its future is in the hands of the Russian government, which has made headway in its outlook on cryptocurrencies in the country. Late last week, local media reported that Russia���s finance ministry had officially drafted a bill that would legalize the trade of cryptocurrencies on regulated exchanges in the country. This also comes after President Vladimir Putin proposed the creation of a multinational cryptocurrency that is intended to be adopted by BRICS and EEU members. It is expected that Russia will legalize and regulate cryptocurrency trade in the country by July 2018, while mining and trading crypto will also be taxed. Russia certainly hasn���t wasted time moving to establish formal regulation of the use of cryptocurrency in the country over the past year. While miners and traders have gone about their merry way, the government has played catch-up over the past 12 months, especially after Bitcoin���s meteoric rise in value. The past month has not been kind on the cryptocurrency market, with wild volatility an everyday occurrence. However, that has not stopped the massive influx of users looking to trade cryptocurrency. Having giving clarity in the direction it wants to take in December, cryptocurrency traders and miners in Russia know what to expect - with a ban ruled out completely. It wouldn���t be surprising to see more big mining operations pop up in the country as demand for cryptocurrency grows - which inevitably puts more strain on the network.	1
The views expressed here are the author���s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com. In terms of technological innovation, Israel has been labeled by some as ���The Startup Nation��� with Israeli ventures raising over $5 billion in capital in 2017. This is almost 10% of China���s yearly fundraising total. While there���s a number of popular applications, platforms, and products including USB flash drives, the Waze navigation app, SodaStream carbonation machines, the country has set its foot in the crypto industry as well. Back in 2017, Hapoalim, Israel���s largest bank, partnered with Microsoft to create a Blockchain-powered platform to ���make the process of signing up guarantors simple and quicker.��� And in February 2018, the Israeli Tax Authority (ITA) stated that cryptocurrencies will be taxed by the capital gains as properties. On February 26, 2018, the country took it even further, when the Israeli Supreme Court handed down a decision that would temporarily block Leumi Bank, limiting a local broker, Bits of Gold, from facilitating the sale of cryptocurrency. Though many were quick to laud the temporary ruling as ���precedent-setting,��� it still leaves ample room for further developments. The judge ruling the case, Anat Baron, said that her decision was ���not intended to harm the bank���s rights to analyze with specificity every transaction that takes place with the bank account or to take any actions that are related to minimizing risks.��� This likely means cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges putting transparency first will be regarded as lawful���for now.  The Supreme Court of Israel in session (The times of Israel) Founder and CEO of Bits of Gold Yuval Roash sees this decision as justified, saying, ���Regulation is one of the things that has been important to us since the beginning. From the very beginning, we saw the problem with Bitcoin in terms of its anonymous characteristics, and we wanted to receive a currency service certificate���and we received it in August 2013.��� This is significant progress from December of last year, when a Tel Aviv district court ruled in favor of Leumi Bank, who had refused service to Bits of Gold because of Bitcoin���s inability to meet anti-money laundering standards. Bank Leumi had also been piggybacking on the Bank of Israel���s June labeling of exchanges as ���websites that facilitate gambling transactions���, which is a sore spot for Israel especially. The country proved to be careful about upsetting the balance within its borders, and even blocked popular ride-sharing application Uber from an Israeli debut. After examining the last five years of Bits of Golds��� operations, Judge Baron determined Leumi���s previous assumption that violations of the law would occur if Bitcoin were left unchecked were false. In relation to the ruling, Yair Geva, head of the Hi-Tech Department of Israeli law firm Herzog, Fox & Ne���eman, remarked: ���It should be emphasized that the Court did not rule on the fundamental question���which has not yet been decided���whether Bank Leumi is entitled to refuse banking services for cryptocurrency trading. Although the final decision is still pending, it seems that this recent verdict of the Supreme Court will continue to give tailwinds to the tremendous growth of the crypto industry in Israel particularly, and to hi-tech as well as the financial industry in general. One of the reasons for this is that the Supreme Court clarified that Bits of Gold operated transparently and did not violate any statutory provision. In other words, the Supreme Court determined that currently there is no direct legal prohibition on cryptocurrency trading in Israel. It remains to be seen how regulators in Israel will respond to this landmark decision.��� Regardless of how regulators will respond, it���s already clear that progress on Israeli blockchain innovations hasn���t slowed. ���As with any new and promising technology, jurisdictions that instate well-balanced policies to promote innovation and adoption, will find themselves attracting talent and business to their ecosystems on grand scales. The best frameworks will be the ones that take a learning approach, allowing entrepreneurs and institutions to deeply understand how these technologies affect all stakeholders and develop the policies which are beneficial to most while educating the public on tradeoffs and accountability. Israel has always seen the advancement of technology as a strength and opportunity, and is well positioned to lead in Blockchain development and applications,��� said Galia Benartzi, Co-founder of Bancor. Itay Nagler, Israeli citizen and CEO of blockchain-driven travel startup Cool Cousin, says that Israelis, as a default, undercut the perception that things can't or shouldn't change. ���We are almost raised to believe that there is always a better, more efficient way to do things. That is one of the main reasons such a small country is home to many great innovative companies and individuals. This is also an explanation to why Israelis were among the firsts to adopt blockchain technology and crypto. A lot of us see it as a wonderful solution to many problems and our mentality of "no fear" to change, and relatively easy access to quality human resources and funding allows us to act on it. This, I believe, helped us during the past decades to position ourselves as pioneers and experts in many industries." Even though there were no concrete regulations of the industry before, it didn���t stop entrepreneurs from launching blockchain projects of their own. Bancor was one of the first major ICOs, raising over $150 million in mere minutes, and has its origins in Israel. IOTA, an IoT-focused Blockchain solution, recently opened an office in Tel Aviv, noting that the city is ���a well-established tech hub, always ranking in the top 10 of start-up reports.���   These positive changes, however, go contrary to the recent decision by the Israeli regulators of not including companies involved in the crypto industry in the TASE, Tel Aviv Stock Exchange indices, due to its ���trading volatility.��� Israel appears to be setting itself in the Blockchain ecosystem, along with the rest of the world, but tries first guarantee that the market���s grey areas be limited while its most useful attributes allowed to flourish.	1
Bitcoin���s popularity should be considered a ���concern for society,��� a UK Academic Larisa Yarovaya told Cambridge Independent. Today, the local newspaper reported an ongoing discussion on Bitcoin���s rapidly growing value amongst Cambridge experts, whose opinions on the subject vary. Yarovaya, a lecturer in accounting and finance at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), commented on a study on Bitcoin she co-authored at the university: Specifically addressing the issue of energy use for Bitcoin mining, she stated: ���I think yes we should be worried. Of course it will have a negative impact on the environment, it���s not an energy-efficient process. The spectrum of Bitcoin���s popularity has to be a concern for a society.��� As Bitcoin prices exploded to over $20,000 in some markets before tailing off this week, the question of whether or not the cryptocurrency���s notable growth is a bubble has enveloped more and more sections of the global economy. Academia has been less vocal than mainstream media and economists on the question. However, Yarovaya���s study of Bitcoin, which looks at the performance of the coin specifically as a currency, makes fairly clear-cut conclusions: ���Our evidence finds that the price of Bitcoin has been artificially inflated by speculative investment, putting it in a bubble.��� Others in the Cambridge discussion see the situation differently. Michael Rauchs, head of cryptocurrency and Blockchain at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, noted that whether or not Bitcoin is a bubble very much depends on how you define the coin itself. His view is that as a currency, Bitcoin is in fact a bubble, as the ARU study says. But as an investment, it���s not necessarily doomed to undergo a bubble-like pop. However, even as an asset or tool for investment, according to Yarovaya Bitcoin is still a bubble. She argued that the digital asset has no ���true value:��� ���I believe even as an investment it���s in a bubble. As an investment, the true value of Bitcoin is potentially zero. It���s not gold, it has no true value. The price is higher than the true fundamental value so sooner or later the investors��� preferences (regarding) Bitcoin and cryptocurrency will change and the bubble will burst.��� More bullish still was data analytics CEO Richard Baker, who forecast Bitcoin prices having ���some way to go��� before hitting a peak, due principally to the launch of futures this month. Emily Mackaym, alternative lender at TAB Capital, meanwhile was more cautious, pointing out that Bitcoin���s performance is very much tied to what people think of it: ���The very mention of the word ���bubble��� could have a self-fulfilling effect of moderating demand too. We live in an age where anything can happen, so I���m not going to try to predict this one!��� Bitcoin had lost around six percent in the 24 hours to press time according to cross-exchange data, trading at an average of $15,800.	1
Thursday, Nov. 15: yesterday's fall in crypto markets continues today, with Bitcoin (BTC) dipping below the $5,400 mark, and total market capitalization dropping as low as $174 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. After an extended period of low price volatility, crypto markets experienced a massive decline yesterday, Nov. 14, with Bitcoin dropping from its average trading price of around $6,400 to as low as $5,506. The recent dive has marked a new volatility record for markets this year. According to BitMEX Daily Historical Bitcoin Volatility Index, Bitcoin volatility rate has exceeded the index of seven for the first time since April this year.

With that, Bitcoin Cash is suffering the biggest losses over 7 days period, at almost 30 percent as of press time, and is trading at $420. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork is scheduled for today, Nov. 15.

A Bitcoin wallet containing millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) has come out of dormancy. For one reason or another, the wallet has not transacted for years despite having what is considered life-changing money.  The wallet had not been used since 2013, barely a few years after the mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared. The wallet currently contains $15 million worth of BTC, and it���s unclear who owns this account or why it was reactivated on Tuesday. The wallet has 321 BTC. After eight years, the value of this amount has increased from $6,594 to a staggering $15,103,046. By now, the funds in the wallet had appreciated almost 2,300 times. The Bitcoin community is abuzz with speculation about who owns the wallet and why it has just come out of dormancy. Some believe that it could be a whale ��� an individual or group with a large stash of Bitcoin ��� who is about to make a move that will shake up the market. If you're looking for a sign....in 3...2...1... https://t.co/8ezk8Ub6Sz A Twitter user proposed several reasons for the wallet activation in a comment thread. Many possibilities exist according to them, from Satoshi Nakamoto deciding to return to a patient investor who is going to sell their BTC now to someone just recalling their seed phrase for their Bitcoin wallet. Someone's maybe figured out a exploit from an old wallet perhaps making not so random seed phrases or something. Too many waking up to be random.. In recent months, several dormant Bitcoin wallets from 2011���2013 have been reactivated, each containing tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. On Sept. 19, the owner of a dormant Bitcoin wallet emptied their account and transferred all 616 BTC to different accounts. Old, sleeping wallets from the early days of Bitcoin are being reactivated with large amounts of cryptocurrency inside. Early investors who put up a few hundred dollars and kept their stakes have evolved into BTC whales, with values continuing to rise. Another Bitcoin wallet awoke in January after having been inactive since June 2010. The wallet had $5 million worth of BTC. In June 2021, another Bitcoin whale account with 900 BTC became active. On Sunday, another dormant address with 235 BTC ($11,114,901) was reactivated after nine years. A dormant address containing 225 BTC was activated on Thursday after almost eight-and-a-half years.	1
Ethereum experienced intense volatility last week, leading to its price crashing as low as $0.10 on GDAX. The exchange now says that it intends to compensate customers for whom stop-losses were triggered during the fall. Ethereum has been one of the star performers in the cryptocurrency space, rising over 40x in 2017. However, network congestion and two ICOs resulted in price volatility last week. Problems at exchanges also contributed to the uncertainty, resulting in Ether price falling. A large sell order (96,100 ETH) at GDAX resulted in the price slipping from $317.81 to $224.48. This resulted in stop-loss orders and margin positions getting triggered, resulting in the price slipping momentarily to as low as $0.10. The drop in the price of Ethereum shows the effect of large sell orders. Investigations by GDAX reveal no attempt at market manipulation and highlights that liquidity at exchanges is limited. In the equity markets, there are usually circuit breakers which stop trading after a large movement in price. Unfortunately, given the inherent volatility in cryptocurrencies, imposing such curbs in these markets is not practical. While all trades were executed correctly during the price volatility last week, GDAX has acknowledged that customers who had stop-losses/margin calls triggered were not happy. Hence it has decided to credit affected customer accounts. GDAX���s VP Adam White writes in a blog post: ���We will establish a process to credit customer accounts which experienced a margin call or stop loss order executed on the GDAX ETH-USD order book as a direct result of the rapid price movement at 12.30pm PT on June 21, 2017. This process will allow affected customers to restore the value of their ETH-USD account to the equivalent value of their ETH-USD account at the moment prior to the rapid price movement.��� The company plans to credit these customer accounts using its own funds and no other customers will be affected. Lucky customers who were able to buy Ether during the flash crash will be able to keep them, with GDAX honoring these trades. The action of GDAX in crediting customer accounts may help it retain its customers, but it does give rise to the question of whether there is a moral hazard in doing so. The flash crash was caused not by any exchange malfunction, but by a large sell order. Compensating customers who lost money during market volatility may lead to others being lax with placing stop-loss orders. Investors have to be cognizant of the risks they face while dealing with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies.	1
In the short space of nine years, Bitcoin has thrust cryptocurrencies into mainstream consciousness by shaking up the financial world. Since its inception in 2009, the preeminent cryptocurrency has thrown a spanner in the works of traditional banking and financial institutions and has paved the way for the creation of a plethora of industry-shaping virtual currencies and blockchain-based innovations. With that being said, it���s been far from smooth sailing for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Dramatic highs and soul-shattering lows have been part and parcel of the past nine years. The volatility of cryptocurrencies has created more than a few detractors and we���ve seen a number of headlines exclaiming the ���death��� of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. These obituaries have come from a wide variety of industry experts and commentators. While they���re almost always subjective, they portray a negative, fear-mongering mentality that detracts from the technological breakthroughs that have been sparked by blockchain technology. Let���s take a look at some of the instances that have led to mainstream media outlets signalling the death of Bitcoin and examine where the industry is at midway through 2018.  It���s not difficult to find articles slamming Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ��� just look at 99bitcoins.com, which has a compendium of Bitcoin obituaries that has now surpassed the 300 mark. The earliest headline heralding the end of Bitcoin, according to the website, is an article entitled ���Why Bitcoin can���t be a currency��� published in a blog entitled The Underground Economist in 2010. In essence, the writer pointed to Bitcoin���s constantly fluctuating value as the main reason why it shouldn���t be considered a currency. ���While Bitcoin has managed to bootstrap itself on a limited scale, it lacks any mechanism for dealing with fluctuations in demand. Increasing demand for Bitcoin will cause prices in terms of Bitcoin to drop (deflation), while decreasing demand will cause them to rise (inflation).��� Since then, the number of headlines suggesting that Bitcoin was doomed to fail has increased year on year. In 2017, there were a total of 118 Bitcoin obituaries articles. These obituaries are any articles that predict the demise of Bitcoin, based on assumptions or quotes from a wide range of commentators. This includes mentions of fraud, ponzi schemes and money laundering and frankly anything that is negative enough to cast aspersions on the future of Bitcoin. While the sheer number of articles that have predicted the death of Bitcoin may be humorous, a glance down the list of headlines from various publications tells a different story altogether. Small scale blogs like the one that is credited for the first Bitcoin death article have a limited reach and aren���t likely to have a profound effect on the sentiment of a large group of people. However, as the number of these articles increases, so too has the caliber and profile of the publications producing this content.  CNBC has covered cryptocurrencies extensively over the last few years, with content that is fairly objective in terms widespread coverage of both positive and negative sentiments towards the industry, With that being said, CNBC has been the source of numerous interviews quoting various sources that have labelled Bitcoin a bubble and ponzi scheme, while speculating on how it would crash. The most telling example of this was JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon comparing Bitcoin to the Dutch Tulip Mania before predicting it would blow up on CNBC. Perhaps more telling was the effect Dimon���s statements had on Bitcoin���s value, which fell after the American executive���s comments: "It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed. Currencies have legal support. It will blow up." In November 2017, Bloomberg published an article that speculated on a number of different factors that could potentially derail Bitcoin as it headed to that $20,000 high in December. The article quoted several sources that point to the number of altcoins, regulations, cyber attacks and the launch of derivatives as pitfalls to Bitcoin���s rise in price and popularity. The Guardian published an editorial in November 2017 that labelled Bitcoin���s price as a bubble, and pointed to the costs of mining, slammed the endorsements by celebrities and made strong statements about Bitcoin���s primary use as means to buy drugs and pay ransoms online. Forbes contributor Jay Adkisson wrote an op-ed which went on to describe the way Bitcoin is currently sold as a scam. The writer boiled down Bitcoin to a core existence as a number, without an intrinsic value. He went on to suggest that cryptocurrencies lack ���uniqueness,��� pointing to the sheer number of cryptocurrencies in existence. The Telegraph also published a number of articles last year, drumming up ���bubble��� rhetoric as the 2017 wound to a close. Abhishek Parajuli took a mighty swipe in his own op-ed on the platform, citing wild volatility, poor utility as a medium exchange as well as slow transaction speeds: ���So, hype aside, Bitcoins are lottery tickets. They have no underlying utility. When the music stops, those left holding them will be burned.��� Wall Street Journal contributor James Mackintosh weighed in on the value of Bitcoin in mid-September 2017. In essence, the writer delved into the notion of Bitcoin having become digital gold as a store of value. Going on to assumptions of an economist ��� as well as a comparison to the price of actual gold ��� the Wall Street Journal contributor suggested a very poor chance of Bitcoin replacing gold as a store of value. While these articles can be well-researched and compelling in their presentation, it���s hard to find a single one that provided compelling evidence that Bitcoin would fail altogether. Some accurately predicted price corrections, but those touting the death of cryptocurrencies are still to be proven right. While Bitcoin has undoubtedly received a far greater amount of negative press in the last nine years, it is not alone. Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has also been in the crosshairs of doomsayers since its launch in 2015. Digiconomist has also compiled a list of Ethereum obituaries, which is up to 16 since 2015. The first of these articles was published on a blog called WallStreetTechnologist run by self-described former Wall Street technologist Jerry David. Written in December 2015, David was of the opinion that Ethereum would fail to launch its platform due a number of factors: ���Too ambitious of goal[s], too complex a system to get it done, and too much money squandered on someone who has little business experience.��� Fast-forward three years and Ethereum has quashed all of those concerns emphatically. However, the journey has been fraught with some hairy moments. In June 2016, following the launch of DAO, cyber-criminals figured out an exploit that allowed the theft of 3.6 million ETH tokens, worth around $60 million at the time. As ArsTechnica reported, the attack truly threatened Ethereum���s continual existence. Close to a year later, a hacker exploited a flaw in Ethereum-based platform Parity which resulted in $34 million worth of ETH being stolen. The platform was somewhat saved by ���white hat hackers,��� that drained other Parity account funds to safeguard against the initial hacker stealing more ETH. This then led website Nulltx laying part of the blame for the Parity multisignature bug on Ethereum itself. ���Smart contracts, which are often seen as the cornerstone of everything Ethereum has to offer, are simply not secure. They weren���t on day one and they still aren���t today. While everything may seem in order most of the time, the Parity multisignature bug shows how easy it is sometimes to manipulate these contracts for financial gain or just to annoy others.��� While these events were sure to draw negative criticism, Ethereum has had to deal with a far smaller amount of obituary-style reviews. The third largest cryptocurrency by market value, Ripple, has also faced some harsh criticism. Bloomberg slated the company for trying to get XRP listed on various exchanges by paying financial incentives for doing so. In January, MIT���s Technology Review said investors jumped on the Ripple bandwagon, in the hopes that it would become the ���next��� Bitcoin. The article suggests that the surge of investment into the blockchain-based cross-border payment system was hyped up and that the project could still fail in the long term. EOS, the fifth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, has received its fair share of disparaging coverage in the lead up to its launch in June. As Cointelegraph reported in it���s review, the blockchain-based operating system faced criticism for the token-swap that was required after a year-long ICO, as well as it���s delegated Proof-of-Stake system. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and EOS CTO Dan Larimer had extensive online debates arguing for their respective consensus protocols, which put a spotlight on both blockchain platforms. Other cryptocurrencies also face plenty of pessimistic forecasts. For instance, Altcoinobituaries is a website that tracks the market value of a number of cryptocurrencies, with foreboding messages of their looming demise.  Following a dramatic high in December 2017, Bitcoin has faced a tough six months of volatility amid the uncertainty of regulations and mitigating factors around the world. As of June 2018, 69 of these doomsday Bitcoin posts have been published, as per 99bitcoins��� list. A number of headlines have continued to label the cryptocurrency as a bubble, citing various sources predicting its demise. Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller followed in Dimon���s footsteps, comparing Bitcoin to ���tulip mania��� in an interview with CNBC in January: "It has no value at all unless there is some common consensus that it has value. Other things like gold would at least have some value if people didn't see it as an investment. It reminds me of the Tulip Mania in Holland in the 1640s, and so the question is did that collapse? We still pay for tulips even now and sometimes they get expensive. [Bitcoin] might totally collapse and be forgotten and I think that's a good likely outcome but it could linger on for a good long time, it could be here in 100 years." The MIT Technology Review published an article in April which explored three different ways that the cryptocurrency could ultimately be brought to its knees ��� namely a government takeover, Facebook takeover or the creation of millions of tokens that eventually make Bitcoin irrelevant. Reuters quoted Bank of England governor Mark Carney in a review which suggested that Bitcoin ���failed��� as a currency. Carney told London Regent University students in February that the cryptocurrencies shortcomings were plain to see: ���It has pretty much failed thus far on the traditional aspects of money. It is not a store of value because it is all over the map. Nobody uses it as a medium of exchange,��� Around the same time, a Forbes headline reading ���Is Bitcoin Heading to Zero��� explored a number of reasons why Bitcoin had seen such a dramatic drop in value. The article was centred around the shortcomings of Bitcoin in relation to Ethereum ��� mainly transaction fees and governance issues. The writer cited PHD economist Eli Dourado���s work on Ethereum, which highlighted the far cheaper transaction costs on the Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, the governance of Bitcoin and its ongoing development was also cited as a point of concern: ���Bitcoin has been unable to seriously address its on-chain scaling problems. Its community has alienated, marginalized, and purged dissenting voices, notably Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, and Jeff Garzik. Its core development team has been captured by an ideological faction committed to only off-chain scaling in the name of decentralization. This faction has undermined consensus scaling agreements and trashed the reputation of anyone who points out any of the above.��� More recently, famed investor Warren Buffett went as far as calling Bitcoin ���rat poison��� in an interview with CNBC: "In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending.If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it but I would never short a dime's worth." These headlines have certainly not been kind to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Taking advantage of the profile of some commentators, markets have been continually bombarded by doomsday prophecies and speculative remarks. The reality of life is that many things are completely out of our control. This is particularly true when it comes to the type of information and news we are subjected to on a daily basis. As Cointelegraph reported in March, cryptocurrency has forced its way into the minds of the masses. This has even led to some of the biggest TV show hosts, from Ellen Degeneres to John Oliver, giving satirical, bizarre and possibly damaging accounts of what Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies actually are. What these TV superstars prove is that the industry is too big not to notice, but is still misunderstood and met with plenty of apathy. It may well be difficult for this tendency to mock and denigrate the cryptocurrency space to stop, but time will tell. Nevertheless, mainstream media outlets ��� be it news or entertainment ��� will continue to mold the perception of millions of people when it comes to cryptocurrencies. The spin, positive or negative, will be dependent on how the sector grows and addresses its own shortcomings in order to build trust and understanding in the global community.	1
A former Bitcoin miner hobbyist has stumbled on an old wallet containing 1,000 Bitcoins, in addition to many Bitcoin forks. On March 10, a thread was posted to Bitcointalk by a self-described ���newbie��� making their first return to crypto after a ���long hiatus,��� seeking advice on accessing an old Bitcoin stash. The user ���whoamisoon��� claimed to have mined some Bitcoin ���a long time ago��� using a GPU and had recently located the wallet.dat file on a USB storage device. The former-miner sought advice on how to move the Bitcoins to sell, also asking if they held the same quantity of Bitcoin Cash in the wallet, and how they might be able to sell the BCH. The user was pleasantly surprised to discover that they would be able to access a myriad of forked coins, writing:  ���Didn't know there have been so many forks! Awesome! Love it!���  Later that day, 1,000 Bitcoins that had been mined on August 24, 2010, were identified to be moving on the Bitcoin blockchain ��� leading many to speculate that the coins may have belonged to whoamisoon. The coins appeared destined for Coinbase. On March 12, the user returned to thank the forum members who had assisted him in realizing his Bitcoin bounty, stating: ���Thank you all for all the suggestions. It was overall a great return and the best welcome one can get! Keep it up; I can see it helping others that are in my shoes as well.��� The post suggested that whoamisoon may have liquidated their holdings prior to March 13 ��� meaning that they may have cashed out in the $7,500 to $8,000 price range, equating to $7.5 million to $8 million. The value of their corresponding BCH and BSV forked coins would have added roughly $500,000 to their payday.	1
The ransomware gang that stole almost 1 terabyte of legal secrets from the biggest names in the entertainment industry is now demanding $42 million in cryptocurrency or else it will expose United States President Donald Trump's ���dirty laundry.��� The gang has already released a 2-gigabyte trove of legal documents marked "Lady Gaga" and fired the link to media outlets including Cointelegraph, which broke the news last week about the attack on New York law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks. The law firm has clients that include Elton John, Robert DeNiro and Madonna. The gang hacked and encrypted the firm���s server, stealing 756 GB of data on confidential contracts, telephone numbers, email addresses, personal correspondence, nondisclosure agreements and more. The company has so far refused to pay up.  The REvil ransomware group ��� also known as Sodinokibi ��� posted a new message on May 14 that said they were doubling their original ransom and using dirt on Trump as leverage: ���The next person we���ll be publishing is Donald Trump. There���s an election going on, and we found a ton of dirty laundry on time.��� Addressing Trump directly, REvil recommended he ���poke a sharp stick at the guys��� (referring to the law firm) within a week if he wanted to remain president. And to the voters: ���We can let you know that after such a publication, you certainly [won���t] want to see him as president.��� The attackers have threatened to release the stolen data in nine staged releases unless their demands for a ransom are met by the firm. The ransomware gang prefers to be paid in Monero, but also accepts Bitcoin for a higher fee. It���s unclear what link Trump has to the firm, as he���s not believed to have ever been a client. According to the New York Post, Grubman is refusing to negotiate with the hackers, despite their threats to ���destroy [the law firm] down to the ground if [they] don���t see the money.��� He believes the hackers may release the documents even if he does pay, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation considers the hack an act of terrorism. The U.S. famously does not negotiate with terrorists. Brett Callow of information security firm Emsisoft described the ransom as ���one of the largest demands ever heard��� and echoed Grubman���s sentiment: ���Companies in this situation have no good options available... Even if they pay the ransom demand, there is no guarantee the criminals will destroy the stolen data if it has a high market value. The data may still be sold or traded... In these cases, it���s possible that the criminals will attempt to extort money directly from the people whose information was exposed.���	0
With a liquidity mining program set to launch on Monday, Aave could be on the cusp of becoming the dominant decentralized finance (DeFi) ledning protocol.  Earlier today, Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) 16 reached quorum, meaning that starting on Monday, 4/26 liquidity providers and borrowers in Aave���s USDC, DAI, USDT, GUSD, ETH, and WBTC pools will earn stAAVE rewards in addition to their standard interest yield. Per AIP 16, providers and borrowers in these pools will split 2,200 stAAVE tokens per day from the protocol���s current 2.9 million AAVE Ecosystem Reserve, currently worth nearly $1 billion. The proposal, written by Aave investor Parafi Capital���s Anjan Vinod, notes that the goal of the program is to ���drive lending and borrowing activity across markets,��� as well as increase the decentralization of the protocol���s governance by distributing governance tokens to more users. The move is something of a novelty for Aave. The lending platform has consistently been ranked among the largest DeFi protocols, despite not having a liquidity mining program like many of its competitors. Per their respective apps, Compound is currently the top lending protocol with over $15.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) across their markets, while Aave counts $6.8 billion across their Polygon, Ethereum v1, Ethereum v2, and AMM LP token markets. Aave co-founder Stani Kulechov told Cointelegraph that he expects that the added incentives will bolster the protocol���s TVL significantly. ���The proposal allocates most of the rewards on stablecoins meaning that we will see substantial increase in TVL,��� he said. As the governance proposal notes, the lack of a liquidity mining program has historically put Aave at something of a competitive disadvantage. For instance, at the time of writing money market Compound offers 3.31% yield on stablecoin USDC, along with 2% in COMP governance tokens for a total of 5.51% yield. Aave���s market, meanwhile, also currently offers an identical 5.51% in pure interest yield. A recent Tweet from Aave developer Emilio Frangella indicates that the new program will bolster yields by orders of magnitude, and notably offers yield to borrowers ��� yield which, at current rates, would well outstrip the APR borrowers owe on their loans. Here is the estimate, if market conditions remain the same pic.twitter.com/3cLisnArPy While the current program is slated to end 07/15/2021, the door is open to some form of liquidity mining continuing for the protocol for the foreseeable future. Per Vinod, ���this program is being proposed as a beta to further investigate how the inclusion of liquidity mining rewards will benefit the Aave ecosystem,��� and at the 2,200/day rate of distribution, the program would deplete only 5% of the Ecosystem Reserve tokens per year.  When first proposed in governance forums, liquidity mining only received 60% support from the community. Kulechov believes that the turnaround is due in part to the community seeing other liquidity mining programs successfully play out.	1
Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $100,000 and Jamie Dimon will be ���begging��� the United States Federal Reserve for money to buy some.  Those were just two of the predictions from Max Keiser on March 5, as the coronavirus outbreak sees financial markets tumble again. Speaking on the latest edition of his RT news magazine, The Keiser Report, the well-known Bitcoin proponent said that global panic would have a profound impact on Bitcoin uptake this year. 2020, he explained, was ���part two of the global financial crisis��� which originally spawned the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2009. ���...Now Bitcoin will experience part two of the global financial crisis ��� it���s already close to $10,000 a coin,��� he told fellow presenter Stacey Herbert. ���This is the global financial crisis that will catapult the price to $100,000 and beyond.���   As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin saw losses in line with traditional markets including gold last week but has made gains in recent days. Referencing a dream which JPMorgan CEO and notorious Bitcoin skeptic Jamie Dimon claimed he had last month, Keiser continued that even he would soon privilege Bitcoin over fiat. Dimon allegedly dreamt that coronavirus infected attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos. While the victims ���spread��� the disease afterward, he appeared happy ��� possibly sarcastically ��� that it had killed the world���s most powerful financial figures. ���The only good news from that is that it might have just killed the elite,��� CNN quoted him as saying at the time. Ironically, it was at Davos in 2018 that Dimon denied to Cointelegraph that he disliked Bitcoin. Keiser meanwhile was wholly unconvinced. ���He���s confusing the coronavirus with the Bitcoin virus; the same thing with Peter Schiff,��� he explained. ���Their minds are being hacked by the Bitcoin virus. Soon Jamie will be a blathering idiot on the ground begging the Fed for money to buy Bitcoin. He���s going to turn into a kind of street urchin. Same with Peter Schiff.��� Gold bug Schiff also continues his criticism of Bitcoin, claiming its price is set for a selloff due to what he considers as insufficient gains this week.	2
Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger described Bitcoin as ���totally asinine��� Wednesday in what some consider will be one of his last public forums, Financial Times reports Thursday, Feb. 15. Speaking at the 2018 annual general meeting of the Daily Journal Corporation, Munger, who is 94, outed himself as one of Bitcoin���s most outspoken naysayers. Asked about what he described as the ���Bitcoin craze,��� Munger���s response was that it should receive a government crackdown. ���I expect the world to do silly things from time to time, because everybody wants easy money,��� he told shareholders at the meeting. ���It���s just disgusting that people are taken in by something like this��� Our government���s lax approach to it is wrong. The right answer with stuff that bad is to step on it hard.��� Additionally describing the cryptocurrency as ���totally asinine,��� Munger went further than even Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett, who in January admitted he ���didn���t know anything about��� the technology. ���I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending,��� he nonetheless offered in comments to CNBC. Cointelegraph has previously reported on how other major figures in traditional finance had U-turned on Bitcoin criticism in the past year. Notably, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon claimed he ���was not a skeptic��� in private comments during January���s World Economic Forum, having said he regretted previously calling Bitcoin a ���fraud.���	1
A firm called Osprey Funds is offering an over-the-counter, or OTC, Bitcoin (BTC) trust under the ticker symbol OBTC. The trust is similar to Grayscale���s Bitcoin Trust, known as GBTC. ���The Osprey Bitcoin Trust provides easy access to bitcoin,��� the firm���s website says. ���With a 0.49% management fee, it is the lowest cost solution.��� Osprey is an entity that ���builds digital asset solutions for intelligent investors,��� claiming OBTC as its ���flagship offering,��� the website adds.  "OBTC began being quoted in the OTC market today, Friday 1/15," Osprey Funds' CEO, Greg King, told Cointelegraph, adding: Competitor Grayscale has become one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world, possessing over 500,000 BTC as of November 2020. The firm is behind GBTC, which serves as a way to buy Bitcoin in stock share form. Each share of GBTC represents a fraction of a Bitcoin ��� 0.00094 BTC per share at the time of publication, based on Grayscale���s website. Interested parties buy and sell shares over-the-counter, available on mainstream brokerage platforms.  GBTC, in part, offers the public easier access to Bitcoin through more traditional avenues, without requiring them to custody their own funds. Grayscale���s Bitcoin Trust comes with a yearly 2% management fee, however. Osprey���s recently unveiled BTC trust touts a fee of 0.49%. ���Osprey is likely trying to capture some of that market share by undercutting GBTC���s fee, according to Bloomberg Intelligence,��� Bloomberg wrote in a report on Friday. Osprey has called on Fidelity as the custodian for the endeavor.  Osprey's Bitcoin fund, however, operates under a Reg. D SEC exemption, while GBTC holds Reg. A and D exemptions, allowing for non-accredited investors to access the fund, albeit with limits on total shares that can circulate among non-accredited investors. ���We are always happy to see digital currency access products enter the market, especially here in the U.S.,��� Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Bloomberg.  ���Accredited investors face a $25,000 minimum to buy directly into the trust,��� Bloomberg wrote. ���Shares have a lock-up period of one year before they can be sold in the secondary market.��� In contrast, Grayscale���s Bitcoin Trust requires assets to be locked up for six months. Osprey could see its 12-month lock-up cut in half in the future, however, based on King���s comments to Bloomberg.  Wilshire Phoenix, an investment firm, filed for a similar product with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2020.	1
At a recent government meeting, Sergei Glazyev, economic adviser to President Putin, said the ���CryptoRuble��� could help alleviate the pressure of Western sanctions, The Financial Times reported Monday. However, there is still no unified official stance from the Russian government on the question of issuing a national digital currency. The Russian CryptoRuble is essentially a digital ruble -- a government-issued digital currency accepted as legal tender. According to FT, Glazyev stated that a government-controlled cryptocurrency like the CryptoRuble would help Russia disregard Western sanctions: ���This instrument suits us very well for sensitive activity on behalf of the state. We can settle accounts with our counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions.��� Glazyev���s positive stance on the CryptoRuble is the latest position in the ongoing back and forth on the topic within the Russian government. According to Russian news agency TASS, during a Dec. 28 meeting on legislation for digital currencies in Russia, government officials spoke negatively about the CryptoRuble. Both the Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev and first Deputy Governor of Russia's Central Bank, Olga Skorobogatova, stated that they did not see a need for issuing a national digital currency. However, in June 2017 at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Skorobogatova held the opposite position, saying: ���We will definitely get to a virtual national currency, we���ve already started working on it.��� The Russian government has been publicly discussing the idea of a government-issued digital currency as legal tender as far back as 2015. Originally, Qiwi, a publicly traded Russian payment service provider, initiated the idea for a Russian national cryptocurrency called ���BitRuble.��� The Russian State Duma has an official working group in place that looks at cryptocurrency risks and regulations. Though there have been reports about possible outright cryptocurrency bans in Russia in the past, the government���s official stance remains unclear, leaning toward regulation of digital currency use.	1
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his electric-vehicle company will start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments once there���s confirmation that miners are utilizing clean energy, offering a glimmer of hope that the FUD surrounding digital assets could soon subside.  Musk responded to a Cointelegraph tweet about recent accusations from Sygnia CEO Magda Wierzycka, who called on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the billionaire for allegedly manipulating Bitcoin���s price.  This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.When there���s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. According to Wierzycka, Musk knowingly pumped the price of Bitcoin only to sell a ���big part of his exposure at the peak.��� ���This is inaccurate,��� Musk said in a Sunday response. ���Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving [the] market.��� As Cointelegraph reported, Musk acknowledged in April that Tesla had sold a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to prove the asset���s liquidity as an alternative to cash. Just one month earlier, the billionaire confirmed that Tesla had added $1.5 billion worth of BTC to its balance sheet and would begin accepting the digital asset as payment for its vehicles.  However, Tesla���s embrace of Bitcoin-as-a-payment was short-lived after Musk flagged concerns over the cryptocurrency���s energy usage. On May 12, Musk tweeted that his company would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to the network���s ���increasingly rapid use of fossil fuels...��� Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP Musk���s tweet coincided with a slew of negative headlines about Bitcoin���s energy usage, China���s intent to ban Bitcoin mining and an overextended crypto rally that was showing signs of weakness. The news cycle helped trigger one of Bitcoin���s most painful episodes, culminating in a 54% drop between mid-April and mid-May. On Sunday, Musk laid the groundwork for when Tesla will once again accept Bitcoin payments: As Cointelegraph reported, Musk was recently invited to a meeting of Bitcoin miners by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor. The Bitcoin Mining Council, a voluntary, self-regulating industry body, emerged from the meeting with a mandate to exercise more renewable energy options and boost the transparency of cryptocurrency mining. Despite all the criticism about Bitcoin mining, it���s estimated that a strong majority of miners already use alternative energy sources. Yassine Elmandjra, an analyst with Ark Investments, told CNBC in April that roughly three-quarters of miners use carbon-free sources in their operations.	0
BlockShow Asia, the much-anticipated Blockchain conference, has just begun in Singapore. The event, powered by Cointelegraph, is designed to allow participants to meet and partner with some of the best and brightest names in the Blockchain community, while also providing valuable insights into how the disruptive technology is growing and impacting industries. The show began with an important announcement, as the Block.One revealed a publicly available testing environment called EOS.IO Single-Threaded Application Testnet (���EOS STAT���). The EOS STAT is designed to be the perfect environment for developers to evaulate, build, and test their DApps, and for potential Block Producers to evaluate the EOS.IO platform. The EOS STAT system offers some important features. For example, the platform simulates the EOS Production environment that will be available in 2018. With the coming release of the new EOS platform, developers will have ample lead time to build and test new DApps. Additionally, the testnet will also feature technical improvements. Block times will reduce to just one second (from the previous three-second timing), and the expected transaction speed will be over 1,000 per second. For interested developers, the EOS team has designed a developer API. Progress can be viewed on GitHub along with substantial resources for getting started on the testnet. In the future, the testing environment will also include a multi-thread application Testnet (MAT), with a genesis block sometime in June of 2018. The announcement represents the next major step forward for the development of Blockchain technology. Much more will be forthcoming from the Cointelegraph team, who is in Singapore covering the show. Additionally, a live feed is available from the conference for everyone who wants to track what���s going on in real time.	2
While gaining exposure might still be difficult south of the US-Canada border, Canadian investors will shortly have a host of options to choose from to gain exposure to Ethereum (ETH) via an ETF as regulators have approved three different Ethereum ETFs in a single day.  Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, and CI Global Asset Management were all approved by Canadian regulators to launch Ethereum-backed ETFs today. The ETFs will be the first ETH ETFs in North America, and among the first in the world.  Some observers noted that all three being approved at once may have been part an effort not to give Purpose an ���unfair advantage���. Purpose appeared to gain an edge after the launch of the wildly popular Purpose Investments ETF, the first North American Bitcoin ETF which quickly swelled to $1.3 billion in AUM while competitors waited for approval. Rival Evolve Fund Group���s Bitcoin ETF only managed to attract $100 million in AUM, despite launching only two days later than Purpose and offering 25% less management fees.  In a Tweet, a reporter for Bloomberg said that the CL Galaxy and the Purpose ETF funds will begin trading on 4/20 ��� a date he thought would please Elon Musk, given it���s marajuana culture connection. Likewise, Evolve���s ETH ETF ��� which they first filed for in March ��� will begin trading on the same day.  Updating yet again... @CIGlobalAsset & @GalaxyDigital just got approval for their #Ethereum ETF alongside @PurposeInvest's. I THINK both will begin trading on ... wait for it ... 4/20 -- Amazing @elonmusk https://t.co/SNFY4jNpUa pic.twitter.com/4ZUSCJEVQ5 The Canadian stock market has already demonstrated a significant appetite for exposure to crypto assets. Previous exchange-traded Ethereum products led to market halts on the first day of listing, and Purpose���s Bitcoin ETF cracked $100 million in its first day of trading.	2
Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith has violated the terms of his bail and has been taken into custody after he allegedly accessed his cryptocurrency account. The remand order came from United States District Judge P. Kevin Castel after Griffith reportedly sought to access Ether (ETH) assets held by Coinbase in May. The Ethereum Foundation researcher will likely spend the next two months behind bars. He is scheduled to be tried on Sept. 21 on charges of conspiracy to violate sanctions with North Korea and faces up to 20 years in prison. According to Law360, Judge Castel���s main concern was flight risk since the assets Griffith held had jumped in value into the $1million range, which may have influenced his decision to check the wallet, the judge stated. Prosecutors sought remand on July 9, claiming that Griffith violated bail terms that sharply restrict his internet use. He allegedly accessed Coinbase to contact the exchange to request the removal of account security functions reportedly stating, ���I���m going to need the [two-factor authentication] removed as the FBI took my devices away.��� Defense lawyers claimed the attempt to access Coinbase was made after consulting his counsel, adding that it was his family in Alabama that made the attempt on his behalf. Griffith was charged and indicted on Jan. 7, 2020, after his arrest in November 2019 for conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. He was initially denied bail but was finally granted a bond order for $1 million at the end of December 2019. Federal authorities believe he assisted North Korea���s efforts to launder money using cryptocurrency to avoid U.S. sanctions after he attended a blockchain conference in Pyongyang in April 2019. In October 2020, Griffith filed a motion to dismiss the conspiracy charges, claiming that his April 2019 conference presentation consisted of widely available public information; therefore, he was not providing a ���service��� to North Korean officials. The following month, lawyers representing the U.S. government labeled the argument ���absurd.���	1
After hitting levels above $20,000 per coin just last week, Bitcoin saw a massive sell-off as fears of a bubble began to loom large. The price reached an all time high of $20,078 on December 17, but saw an approximate 40% drop in just three days, once dipping to as low as $11,833 on December 22. However, in spite of fears, the market has rebounded again, and is now stabilizing above $14,000. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at an average of $15,147, according to Coinmarketcap.  The recovery so far seems to have justified the approach of HODLers (���Hold On for Dear Life���) who refuse to sell in times of market fear. Good morning to everyone except the traitors who sold their bitcoins yesterday Nevertheless, the drop-off saw hedge-fund manager Mike Novogratz delay the issuing of his hedge-fund, citing the substantial swings in the market as well as potential conflicts of interest as the cause. On the contrary, however, Kain Warwick, Founder and CEO of Havven, an asset-backed cryptocurrency, made it clear that the rebound should have been expected, telling Cointelegraph: ���Bitcoin rebounded because there is significant support at psychological levels like 10k, so once the price stopped falling people came in to buy the dip.���	2
Majority of American Bitcoin investors are optimistic that Bitcoin will perform even better in 2018. While the Bitcoin ���mania��� may seem absurd for traditional investors, millennials don���t seem to agree with the past. Instead, we���re seeing more and more millennials jumping on the bandwagon and picking Bitcoin as their top choice over other investment options. Such reality is further revealed in a survey conducted by LendEDU in November 2017 with approximately around 77 percent of the polled 565 Americans claiming that Bitcoin price will increase higher and faster next year than its seventeen-fold appreciation in 2017. Considering that most investors prefer Bitcoin for its decentralized nature, most respondents do not favor the implementation of additional digital currency regulations next year. ���We found that the plurality of Bitcoin investors do not want additional regulation in 2018. However, we thought it was interesting to see that 20 percent of our respondents are unsure about the idea of increased regulation.��� When asked whether many of these investors are likely to invest more in cryptocurrency, it shows that almost 75 percent of the respondents claimed that they plan to increase the size of their Bitcoin investments in 2018, with fewer than 10 percent stating that they have no intention to do so. Whether it���s highly based on price increase speculation or not, around 31.5 percent said that they will sell some of their Bitcoin holdings next year, with 40 percent claiming that they would not and 28.5 percent stating that they are not yet sure on what to do. Around 51 percent of the pollsters said that they are planning to make at least one physical purchase using their digital currency, whereas 30 percent are still unsure if they will use it in their purchases or not. When asked if they favor more regulations on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, roughly 50 percent of participants claimed that they are not in favor of additional laws, while slightly more than 30 percent expressed their willingness to embrace more regulations. With such varied opinion, it goes to show that many regular Bitcoin investors are likely to look into locking in their profits when 2018 comes despite the increasing price projections and market cap.	1
As the Bitcoin block size debate rages, unconfirmed transactions pile up and the minimum transaction fee recommended while sending Bitcoins continues to increase, we take a look at three things taken for granted a year back, but which have been made impossible due to high transaction fees. Physical Bitcoins come in all shapes and sizes. Casascius coins, which were made during the initial days of Bitcoin, range from 1 BTC to 1000 BTC. Physical Bitcoins produced later hold a much smaller value of Bitcoins. Bitcoin chips produced by BTCC start from 1K bits (or 1 mBTC). In case you want to redeem the Bitcoins contained in the chips, it would cost you more in transaction fees. This makes the chips worthless, except as collectibles. Roger Ver expressed his frustration in a tweet stating: ���Core's small block & high fee policy have now made @YourBTCC physical Bitcoins worth less than the fee to redeem them. #Irony.��� Every transaction generates change outputs. Sometimes, these change outputs are smaller than 1 mBTC, which means that they cannot be economically included as inputs in a transaction. If they were added to a transaction, the increase in transaction fees would be greater than their value. A perusal of the outputs over a full day indicates that ~5 BTC per day of output (change or otherwise) currently cannot be economically spent. In the early days of Bitcoin, content publishers often added their Bitcoin address to their articles. People who felt that these articles were deserving often tipped the authors a small amount of Bitcoin. While this is still technically possible, it would cost you $2 in transaction fees to tip an author $1. This kills the incentive for tipping small amounts. Microtransactions, in general, have become infeasible due to the high transaction fees. The solution to high transaction fees is simple ��� increase the transaction capacity of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Whether this is to be done through larger blocks or implementing SegWit is a deeply divisive debate. The Bitcoin community, however, remains optimistic about a solution being found.	0
The Japanese Bitcoin exchange market has led Bitcoin���s price surge over the past few months. Some analysts including Koji Higashi, project leader of ORB and co-founder of IndieSquare, believe that Japanese investors may be leading the next alternative currency (altcoin) bubble. Since early 2017, the cryptocurrency industry has seen more successful initial coin offerings (ICOs) secure millions of dollars at a hundred million dollar valuation. Like many investors, Higashi remained skeptical toward this bubble-like growth of the ICO and altcoin market because there was little to no market data and actual evidence to supplement or justify the market���s recent growth. Blockchain projects that haven���t even completed alpha to beta testing of their software and secured actual user base raised tens of millions of dollars by selling their local tokens. According to Higashi, ���not-so-smart money��� is flowing into the altcoin and ICO markets, led by Japanese investors. He said: ���I think I know the answer now. Newly entering Japanese investors are driving this great altcoin bubble and not-so-smart money is flowing into the space especially into some altcoins at a rather concerning rate.��� In an analytical blog post entitled ���New wave of Japanese investors are fueling the altcoin bubble,��� Higashi introduced an important element and component of the approach of local investors. Ever since the Japanese government granted its green light to Bitcoin and digital currency investment by effectively legalizing cryptocurrencies, Japanese investors started to actively invest in digital currencies without proper research and understanding of certain altcoins. For instance, Higashi noted that Ripple (XRP) is one of the most popular altcoins in the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange market due to the reasons Cointelegraph provided in its previous coverage of Ripple���s explosive growth. In an article entitled ���Ripple Overtakes Ethereum to Become Second Largest Crypto After Japanese Bank Consortium Formed,��� Cointelegraph reported that the market cap of Ripple began to surge as Japanese banks started to experiment with XRP. Focusing on Ripple���s recent growth, Higashi wrote: ���XRP has been popular for a long time in Japan for whatever the reason. Maybe it���s because major Japanese banks are experimenting with Ripple technology and people here tend to have a lot of faith in banks and large institutions Ripple Labs is partnering with in Japan.��� However, Higashi explained that the majority of investors in altcoins such as Ripple and NEM, the two most popular altcoins being traded in Japan as of current, have little to no understanding of their purpose and origin of value. He simply noted that trading cryptocurrencies have become the new trend of investment. ���Another thing to note about this new trend is that the general lack of understanding or appreciation of the technology by many of new users. This is no surprise and all of us have been there at one point but the new wave of Japanese investors seem to be exhibiting a whole new level of incomprehension and misguided decision making in my opinion,��� said Higashi.	0
Ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum platform and the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, reached a new all-time high today, trading at $914 earlier this morning. At press time Ether was trading at an average of $889 and boasting a 16.26 percent increase in price in the past 24 hours. In the past month, the price has seen over 100 percent growth, increasing from around $440 on Dec. 1, 2017 to today���s highs.  Ether���s price had been fluctuating between $200-$400 since May 2017. The altcoin���s steady upward growth started in mid-December 2017, and the coin hit its previous record high of almost $880 on Dec.19, according to coinmarketcap.com.  The third-largest cryptocurrency has seen astonishing growth this year, its market cap growing from $698 mln to today���s $86 bln, a 12,000 percent increase. On Jan. 1, 2017 the price of Ether was $8.  Today���s price peak took place amidst increased ETH trading volumes, notably in Asia. At press time, Singapore-based exchange Coinbene was in the lead, boasting 24-hour trading volumes of $600 mln, almost 11 percent of overall Ether trading volumes. Hong Kong/Tokyo-based exchange Binance is also seeing a notable trading volume of almost $360 mln, with South Korea-based Bithumb close behind with 24-hour volumes around $340 mln at press time. Meanwhile, the entire cryptocurrency market is seeing growth today, with most of the top 20 altcoins showing 24-hour increases, several around 30 percent and one as much as 83 percent. Bitcoin (BTC) is showing a humble 4.25 percent price increase, and BTC dominance hit an all-time low today of 35.9 percent.	2
Apple has recently submitted a new patent application that uses Blockchain within a prospective system for creating and verifying timestamps. Based on the public application to US Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday where Blockchain technology was used to certify timestamps as a program combined with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) tools. Apple's application describes three possible methods for establishing timestamps, with one of these scenarios centering on a Blockchain platform. There is a use case in question where data stored involves tying a piece of information to a particular transaction on a Blockchain, establishing the state of that data at a particular point in time. The program would generate a block containing a timestamp, with every subsequent block being added as miners verify each transaction conducted on the chain. This system is part of what Apple is calling a "multi-check architecture," meaning that another system would confirm the timestamp after the block is generated but before it is added to the chain. Like other established institutions, Apple believes in the power of Blockchain technology and its benefits. Apple has seen the benefits of how the transactions are verified and approved by consensus among participants in the network, making fraud more difficult. The technology operates on a distributed rather than centralized platform, with each participant having access to exactly the same ledger records, allowing participants to enter or leave at will and providing resilience against attacks. According to the application, using a decentralized ledger to store timestamps has two main benefits - it can propel the time to maintain permanent and can have a protected from corruption if a single node is compromised by malicious actors.	1
An ex-Google tech lead and YouTuber with more than 1.1 million subscribers has been accused of engineering a multi-million-dollar ���pump-and-dump��� scheme. Patrick Shyu, known pseudonymously as TechLead on YouTube, launched the Million token (MM) via an initial DEX offering on leading decentralized exchange Uniswap on Thursday.  The project���s website describes Million as a pre-mined cryptocurrency with a fixed supply of 1 million tokens that are backed by one USD Coin (USDC) each per token. The website emphasizes that despite only being backed by $1 million worth of stablecoins, MM has ���no maximum value.��� After being priced at $1.00 on launch, MM saw a mammoth 3,500% increase within just three days to hit $36.87 on Sunday. The price has since crashed, declining by 58% to sit around $15.26 at the time of writing.  The immediate crash that followed Million���s price high has led to accusations the project is a pump-and-dump on Twitter, with user DCF GOD highlighting the large sums of liquidity that had been pulled from Uniswap by the same address that minted MM tokens.  ���By removing liquidity and not selling, he���s effectively selling without ���selling.��� This way he doesn���t have to tell the community that he sold while they all bought, he just has to hold his initial promise of keeping 1m of usdc liquidity,��� they argued.  Okay last tweet since I have folks telling me I don't know how uniswap worksYou can ignore all the liquidity stuff and just compare balancesTechlead start balance:- 1M $USDC- 1M $MMTechlead current balance:- 3M $USDC- about 113k $MMHe has sold MM and gained $2M Shyu responded to the thread, labeling it ���absolute FUD,��� arguing, ���This is literally how liquidity works in Uniswap V3 [...] liquidity ranges are created, you literally cannot do it any other way.��� Popular commentator ChainlinkGod.eth 2.0 commented that TechLead had completely missed DCF���s point, stating, ���You���ve created a ���get rich quick��� scheme so you can dump on your followers, you���ve added liquidity when the price is low and removed it when the price was high and profited the difference in $USDC.��� Shyu published a YouTube video on Tuesday addressing the accusations, denying that he ���rug-pulled��� investors by removing liquidity. However, the YouTuber also emphasized that MM ���should not be considered an investment,��� describing the project as a ���social experiment���:	1
The recent meteoric rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led to the appearance of some unlikely millionaires.  A recent interview by Forbes magazine shows just how powerful Bitcoin has been over the course of the past decade for those who invested early. The interviewee, a former software engineer in Silicon Valley, asked to remain nameless. However, he did explain that he started purchasing Bitcoin in 2010 after doing some research. He decided that the purchase should be sizable enough to provide some real upside, should Bitcoin ever increase in value, and so he bought $3,000 worth, or, at the time, 20,000. When the Bitcoin price really started to jump, he made his first sale of 1,000 Bitcoin, netting him $2.6 mln. Since then, he���s quit his day job and now travels the world, flying first class and staying only in five-star resorts. After explaining his multiple sell-offs, and the $25 mln in profits he���s realized thus far, he explained that he sees Bitcoin values at $150,000 in the long term. ���I really do think it will get there,��� he says confidently, "But a lot of governments and companies will have to be on board, first. No amount of speculation in the world will push it that high.���	2
Google will ban all cryptocurrency-related advertising of all types in June 2018, according to a recent update to their Financial Services policy. The news of a crypto ad ban comes just days after crypto advertisers using Google Adwords noticed a drastic drop in the number of views of their advertisements, according to posts on the Adwords support pages. However, Google Adwords had at that time denied any change in their Financial Services regulations that would block cryptocurrency or Initial Coin Offering (ICO) related advertisements. Under Google���s newly updated financial products policy, no advertisements for ���cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice),��� will be accepted. The move affects all of Google's ad products, meaning companies will not be able to serve crypto-related ads on the search engine giant���s own sites, as well as third-party sites in its network. Scott Spencer, the Director of Sustainable Ads at Google, told CNBC today, March 14: "We don't have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we've seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it's an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.��� Facebook had already banned crypto related advertisements in January of this year, citing the potential for ���deceptive promotional practices.��� Cryptocurrency advertisements have also reportedly been disappearing from Chinese social media sites amidst China���s bans of crypto exchanges and ICOs.	0
The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released a memo March 23, reminding US citizens of the need to report their digital currency earnings on their income tax returns. The IRS notes that Notice 2014-21 defines digital currencies as property, and they are thus subject to federal property taxes. Those who fail to report their crypto earnings can be ���liable for penalties and interest,��� and ���in more extreme situations [...] criminal prosecution.��� The recent memo highlights the ���inherently pseudo-anonymous aspect��� of cryptocurrency transactions, which the organization believes may lead some taxpayers to be ���tempted to hide taxable income from the IRS.��� In 2017, only .04 percent of customers of personal finance service Credit Karma reported crypto transactions on their tax returns.	0
Crypto YouTuber Sunny Decree recently saw his livestream cut short by YouTube, with the platform stating the video had violated its 'harmful and dangerous policy.��� According to a Sept. 5 tweet from Sunny Decree, the video-sharing platform halted his most recent livestream on his English language channel ��� based in Switzerland, the content creator also records in German ��� and warned him a second offense would result in a one-week suspension of service for livestreaming, uploading, and posting.  Decree���s channel has been targeted by YouTube before. In December 2019, the platform began aggressively deleting videos with crypto-related content. High-profile channels, including Decree���s ��� whose channel has more than 123,000 subscribers ��� had videos removed without explanation. YouTube later called the move an ���error��� and restored many of the videos. However, the platform has continued to target a number of crypto-related channels, seemingly in response to the fake ���crypto giveaway��� scam videos that are periodically posted.  In June, the platform shut down the official channel of cryptocurrency news-focused website Bitcoin.com for ���a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service.��� After an appeal, the channel and all 40,000 subscribers was restored two days later.  Cointelegraph has had similar experiences regarding YouTube���s strange attitude towards cryptocurrency. The platform suddenly pulled the plug on Cointelegraph���s Bitcoin Halving livestream in May and cut the July 15 livestream coverage on the infamous Twitter hack short.	0
Bitcoin (BTC) remains the top ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap and as the third block reward halving is set to occur in 14 days, investors are hopeful that the price will find a path to a new all-time high. This is because the block reward halving is usually preceded by a powerful rally that many have long forecast would bring the digital asset to a new all-time high. Surprisingly, Joe007, one of the biggest Bitcoin whales in the cryptocurrency market, has implied that the halving is already priced in, which may leave the cryptocurrency vulnerable to a crash. In a sarcastic tone, Joe007 said: ���No, of course it's not priced in. On the very day of The Great Halvening, everybody will finally realize how underpriced BTC is, and they will all rush to buy it. In droves. With their unemployment checks.��� Joe007 is estimated to be holding a large Bitcoin short position, as shown by data from the Bitfinex leaderboard. It indicates that the trader is down $11.3 million in the past month. Given that the Bitcoin price has increased to around $7,700, it shows the whale is holding a large short position and expects the price of BTC to decrease in the short-term.  Bitcoin whales on the Bitfinex leaderboard. Source: Bitfinex The Bitcoin block reward halving, a process that decreases the amount of BTC generated by miners, happens every four years. It cuts the revenue of miners by half overnight, forcing miners to adapt to the change and often shaking out overleveraged miners. The halving is not an unexpected event; in fact, the mining industry prepares for the halving at least 12 months out by establishing strong cash-buffers and negotiating with electricity service providers to try to decrease the cost of mining. In the near-term, there is no clear reason to anticipate a sudden surge in the price of Bitcoin simply because the halving is approaching.  The tendency of the cryptocurrency market to demonstrate ���sell-the-news��� sell-offs and the lack of a short-term upsurge in the past two halvings suggest that the narrative of a halving Bitcoin rally is premature. The Bitcoin price is also hovering at a multi-year resistance area between $7,700 and $8,300. The 200-day simple moving average, which indicates a major long-term reversal point for an asset or an index, is also currently at $8,000.  XBT USD daily chart. Source: TradingView The clear overhead macro resistance and large sell order clusters on major spot exchanges at the $8,000 level suggest that BTC remains vulnerable to a sharp pullback. Billionaire investors like Marc Cuban, Carl Icahn, and Paul Tudor Jones are increasingly moving towards cash, hedging their positions anticipating big downtrends to arrive in the stock market in the short-term. As the coronavirus pandemic expands and major countries remain unsure when to reopen their economies, high-risk assets like single stocks and cryptocurrencies could see subsiding momentum in the coming weeks. At a technical level, despite the imminence of the halving, a rejection of Bitcoin at a key level like a 200-day SMA at $8,000 could lead to a strong market pullback, as seen in May and October 2019.	0
Fewer than 100 out of 250,000 citizens, or 0.04 percent, who have filed federal tax returns this year to date via personal finance service Credit Karma reported cryptocurrency transactions to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Reuters reported Tuesday Feb. 13. Credit Karma Tax General Manager Jagjit Chawla said that the company was not surprised about such a small amount of cryptocurrency filers, since citizens ���with more complex tax situations��� usually tend to file later in the tax season. However, Chawla added that considering the rise of cryptocurrencies in 2017, the company ���would expect more people to be reporting���. The US 2018 tax filing season began Jan. 29 and the deadline to submit 2017 tax returns is April 17. The IRS, which started providing guidance for taxation of Bitcoin in March 2014, treats cryptocurrency as property. As such, the IRS considers the purchase, sale, trade, and mining of cryptocurrency as taxable events. Independent cryptocurrency trader Brandon Williams told CNBC that it would be more reasonable for him to treat cryptocurrencies as currencies, since property status is ���almost a deterrent in [the] pursuit of mainstream adoption���. According to Williams, the tiny amount of cryptocurrency tax filings reported by Credit Karma points out ���the difficulty in accurately reporting your crypto gains and losses". Williams said that with more than two cryptocurrency tradings a day, it takes at least three or four hours every two weeks to record trading gains and losses, taking into consideration volumes and volatility.	0
Canada���s Hydro Quebec will have to turn away cryptocurrency miners looking to setup operations in the province. The electricity supplier has been inundated with requests from cryptocurrency miners looking to setup operations in energy-rich province Quebec, according to Reuters. Many miners, including giants like China-based Bitmain, have made it clear that they are looking to setup new mining operations overseas in countries with low power costs and surplus of energy. The crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges in China, as well as talks of power regulations applying to miners, has prompted miners to consider new sites to operate from. Bitmain told Reuters that it has been mining in Canada since 2016, although the location of their Canadian operation was not revealed. Ironically, Hydro Quebec may have to renege on its commercial power strategy - as forecasts show that they would not be able to meet the booming demand of industries looking to take advantage of the energy surplus in the province. The company is reviewing its plans after 70 cryptocurrency mining operators applied to set up shop in the province in the space of the week. Hydro Quebec claims to have a surplus of 100 terawatt hours over 10 years. As a reference, Digiconomist���s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates the combination of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash���s estimated annual electricity consumption around 31 terawatt-hours The utility supplier���s spokesman, Marc-Antoine Pouliot, told Reuters that the sheer number of companies looking to start cryptocurrency mining operations in the province is not sustainable, even with the surplus created by Hydro Quebec. ���We are receiving dozens of demands each day. This context is prompting us to clearly define our strategy. We won���t be able to power all the projects that we���re receiving. This is evolving very rapidly so we have to be prudent.��� The utility has also been actively attracting data centers to the province since 2016, citing the potential for job creation by these centers. In an earlier interview with Reuters, HQ business development director David Vincent said potential mining operators were looking at sites with energy demands ranging from those of data centers to that of power-hungry as metal smelting plants. Another stumbling block in the way of cryptocurrency operations being established is the lack of buildings ready for occupation.	0
The South Korean financial regulator Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has claimed that it has no plans at present to regulate the trading of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, beyond ���rules announced last week���. The watchdog based its decision on the fact that it does not consider digital currencies to be a substitute for money, as they are not legal tender in the country. During a press conference on the issue, FSS Governor Choe Heung-sik claimed that the only role the regulator should play in the digital currency space is warning the public about potential risks: ���All we can do is to warn people as we don���t see virtual currencies as actual types of currency, meaning that we cannot step up regulation for now.��� He also added that the introduction of any cryptocurrency regulation in the country will only promote digital currency trading, as investors will think that the watchdog already recognizes cryptocurrency as ���actual��� currency. The remarks of the governor are similar to his previous statements. In November 2017, he announced that the FSS will not directly supervise the operations and activities of digital currency exchanges since the virtual currencies being traded are not legal tender in the country. Given its position, the government was content issuing several rules, rather than establishing regulations, to oversee the local Bitcoin and digital currency industry. In the past, major exchanges in the country braced themselves and were ready to undergo all sorts of regulatory and compliance steps should financial regulators in the country decide to take action. Apart from a number of rules that were already issued, the National Tax Service (NTS) is currently drafting a framework on how to effectively collect taxes on cryptocurrency trading transactions. The NTS will most likely introduce capital gains taxes on companies and individuals who trade digital currencies.	2
Approximately 2.3 Ether (ETH) is being burnt every minute through the new transaction fee mechanism introduced in Ethereum���s London upgrade on Thursday. The highly anticipated London hard fork went live on Thursday this week, ushering in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 upgrade that adjusted gas fees. Part of that adjustment introduced a mechanism that burns some of the base fees collected. The total amount of ETH burnt since the upgrade went live is roughly 3,395 ETH, according to the various counters available. Etherchain reports an average burn rate of 2.36 ETH per minute. This equates to $6,596 per minute, or around $395,000 of ETH going up in metaphorical smoke every hour at current prices. An alternative counter called Ultrasound.money reports a total burn of 3,390 ETH worth a whopping $9.5 million at the current ETH prices of around $2,800. The tracker reports that the popular nonfungible token marketplace OpenSea is the top ETH burner with 374 ETH, or just over $1 million dollars, destroyed since the upgrade was launched. In second place was Uniswap���s v2, which has burned 263 ETH, worth $740,000 at the time of writing. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams commented on the burn rate stating that if things continue at the same rate, the protocol could burn as much as 350,000 ETH, or almost $1 billion, per year.  It���s been 2 hours since the launch of EIP-1559 @Uniswap (v2+v3) is doing its part burning ~80 ETH so far������������������ At this rate, Uniswap alone is burning 350,000 ETH - close to $1b worth - per year Congrats to everyone who made EIP-1559 happen. Huge win for Ethereum The Bankless DeFi newsletter threw around some figures in an attempt to predict the impact on the future supply. Since the base fee is anywhere between 25% and 75% of the total transaction fee, manual calculation and predictions are difficult.  It modeled burn rates within this range, using data on fees generated in 2021, and concluded: When combined with the reduction in block reward issuance from the merge to proof-of-stake, the fee burning could lead to Ether having a deflationary supply, which would see it fulfill the increasingly used meme of ���ultrasound money.���	1
Investor Bill Miller is bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) despite the cryptocurrency touching multi-month lows below $40,000 in early January 2022. Miller no longer considers himself just a ���Bitcoin observer��� but rather a real Bitcoin bull, as he said in a WealthTrack interview last Friday. The billionaire investor now holds 50% of his net worth in Bitcoin and related investments in major industry firms like Michael Saylor���s MicroStrategy and BTC mining firm Stronghold Digital Mining. An early Amazon investor, Miller owns almost 100% of the rest of his portfolio in Amazon, he noted. Miller bought his first Bitcoin back in 2014 when BTC was trading around $200 and then purchased a ���little bit more overtime��� when it became $500. The investor did not buy it for years until BTC plummeted to $30,000 after hitting around $66,000 in April 2021, he said. ���This time I started buying it again at $30,000, down from $66,000 and the reasoning was there���s a lot more people using it, there���s a lot more money coming in from the venture capital world,��� Miller stated, adding that he bought a ���fair amount in the $30,000 range.��� The billionaire investor noted that he looks at Bitcoin as an ���insurance policy against a financial catastrophe��� as well as a powerful investment tool that has been outstripping gold. He also pointed out Bitcoin���s scarcity, meaning that only 21 million Bitcoin can be created. While pouring as much as 50% in BTC in related markets, Miller recommended individual investors to put at least 1% of their assets in Bitcoin, stating: Now celebrating his 40th anniversary in the investment business, Miller currently serves as chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, a company he founded back in 1999 while working at investment giant Legg Mason. The legendary investor is known for beating S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years with Legg Mason, where he reportedly controlled up to $70 billion. Miller���s signature fund, Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust, lost two thirds of its value due to a financial crisis by the end of 2008.	2
As token prices plunge and Ripple prepares for court, a band of XRP enthusiasts have rallied around a petition that may force a White House statement on the recent SEC lawsuit alleging Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering.  A petition filed on the White House-run We the People website titled ���We the People ask the federal government to deem XRP, the virtual currency, a currency,��� has now crossed 10,000 signatures.  Created by the Obama administration in 2011, We the People allows users to create petitions that, upon reaching 100,000 signatures within 30 days, will prompt an official White House response. While many of the petitions are serious, the platform has been home to more than one lark: one of the most famous petitions called for the construction of a Death Star. The XRP petition, created by ���J.W.���, calls for the SEC to ���cease��� its ���frivolous��� lawsuit, referencing a previous FinCEN determination that XRP is a currency. The petition also references XRP���s rapidly-deteriorating marketcap ��� a drawdown that TheTIE���s Joshua Frank has called the ���third largest collapse of all-time��� ��� as well as the ���hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans��� who are ���suffering irreparable harm and damages.��� XRP's market cap has fallen by 93% from $137B to under $10B. That makes the value of the XRP collapse bigger than Enron and Worldcom. While not a bankruptcy, XRP is effectively the third largest collapse of all time behind Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. The petition effort comes as Ripple prepares for a February pretrial conference, the first of what may prove to be a long and contentious legal process. Following the SEC���s filing a suit on December 22nd, the number of major exchanges who have delisted XRP continues to grow, and Ripple has released a statement encouraging investors and the press to wait to hear the company���s side of the story before coming to any conclusions.  As the legal process moves forward, petition signers find themselves with few options. Said one redditor:	1
Crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase reported today at 1:53 a.m. PST, about five hours ago to press time, that Bitcoin (BTC) buys and sells are ���intermittently available���. The notice on Coinbase���s status site states: ���A recurring issue with one of our processes is causing Bitcoin buys and sells to become temporarily unavailable. Our team is investigating and working to restore full service as soon as possible. Coinbase customers may experience intermittent outages of BTC buys and sells over the duration as we resolve this issue. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.��� The official tweet announcing the service interruption this morning on Coinbase���s separate Support Twitter account was met with almost all negative comments from customers, some claiming their funds had been frozen on the service since long before. [status] Investigating: A recurring issue with one of our processes is causing Bitcoin buys and sells to become tem��� https://t.co/Zc5he85Q8h Coinbase had experienced technical problems of a different kind earlier this month, when accidental multiple charges for credit and debit card purchases of crypto were reported by Coinbase customers. Visa accepted full blame for the issue, citing an unexpected error caused by the change of the merchant category code (MCC) for crypto purchases that took place at the beginning of February. Coinbase���s site also suffered an outage on May 25 of last year, citing an unprecedented amount of traffic volume as the cause. In mid-January, the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange was offline for more than 48-hours, after a regularly scheduled two-hour maintenance was extended when a bug was found in the production environment.	0
Bitcoin has hit new all-time price highs on its ninth birthday today as CME Group announces futures trading. Investors still celebrating the weekend���s record-breaking $6,300 have little to fear this Halloween as renewed momentum coming from CME takes Bitcoin within reach of new heights. We're launching #Bitcoin futures to provide a regulated trading venue for the #digitalasset market. https://t.co/5RRvVCGtjB pic.twitter.com/zcbCAUriUd The move appeared broadly expected Tuesday even without the news, analyst Tone Vays and investor Max Keiser both predicting imminent peaks. $7,000 staring us in the face. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/SHKAJB4lg0 According to data from Bitcointicker, Bitcoin advanced 2.1 percent in the 24 hours to press time to hit $6,300.  The latest surge, which began late last week, initially pulled major altcoins along with Bitcoin, but the trend has since faltered. Bitcoin Cash, in particular, has reversed the top of its gains which saw the fork hit multi-week highs approaching $500.	2
After breaking through the $20,000 mark on Dec. 17, Bitcoin suffered a rather large correction to $12,000 before rebounding and settling between $13,000 and $15,000. However, the digital currency has suffered a few setbacks since that monster rally, leaving some to wonder if the bull run might be over. The 2013 bull run was ended by the dramatic collapse of Mt. Gox, and so far, nothing that big has happened to Bitcoin. Nonetheless, it���s always possible that the end of 2017���s extraordinary run could die by a thousand cuts. Last year, China first banned ICOs and then closed cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Now the government is taking aim at mining. China has long been the epicentre for Bitcoin mining, in large part due to the country���s inexpensive electricity prices. Now the Chinese government is considering restricting Bitcoin miners��� access to inexpensive sources of power, which would significantly change the economics of Bitcoin mining. There has also been a change in the dominance factor of Bitcoin as many looked to diversify their digital currency portfolios to better performing altcoins. Coins like Ripple, Ethereum and Tron have surged in value, essentially stealing market share from Bitcoin. As recently as March 2017, Bitcoin made up 85% of the total market capitalization of the entire market. Today, Bitcoin���s so-called dominance, or market share, has dropped to an all-time low of 33.6%. The second largest country in the world, India, is starting to look hostile as its government seeks to tighten regulation on digital currencies. Recently, an advocate for Public Interest Litigation filed to immediately regulate the flow of Bitcoin in and out the country. In Venezuela, a place where Bitcoin has flourished due to the unrest and economic breakdown, President Maduro has ordered the issue of the country���s own digital currency, the Petro, which Venezuelans might see as Bitcoin���s competition. However, it should be noted that a country officially issuing its own digital currency certainly adds legitimacy to the concept of cryptocurrency as a whole. Further, since Maduro can���t restrain himself from printing a nearly unlimited supply of Bolivars, it���s likely the Petro will eventually suffer the same hyperinflation. The charts are indecisive, with Bitcoin���s price currently in a consolidation pattern. Expect this sideways ���triangle��� to break either up or down later this month. Volume is also down, below its 30 day moving average, but this is common in a consolidation phase.  It should be remembered that the rise from $9,000 to $20,000 occurred in just three weeks, so the market likely needs some time to get its legs back under it.	0
Analysts at Deutsche Bank released a note to clients on Friday, Jan. 19 stating that there is a growing correlation between the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as Wall Street���s ���Fear Index.��� Masao Muraki, a global financial strategist at Deutsche Bank, along with two colleagues Hiroshi Torii and Tao Xu, wrote in the note that a lack of fluctuation and volatility in the stock market is leading investors to look elsewhere to make money. Because of institutional investors��� growing interest in more risky investments like cryptocurrencies, Muraki writes in the note, the "correlation between Bitcoin and VIX has increased dramatically:" The note contines: ���Now, a growing number of institutional investors are watching cryptocurrencies as the frontier of risk-taking to evaluate the sustainability of asset prices. The result is that institutional investors, who are supposed to value assets using their sophisticated financial literacy, analysis, and information-gathering strengths, are actually seeking feedback about the market from cryptocurrency prices (which are mainly formed by retail investors)." Muraki���s main point is that as long as volatility in the stock market is decreasing, the price of BTC and other mainstream cryptocurrencies will continue to rise as investors continue to turn to the crypto market to make money. While markets for traditional assets are currently relatively predictable, the crypto market is anything but stable. After breaking $20,000 per coin in mid-December 2017, BTC crashed to down below $10,000 on Jan. 17. BTC is currently trading at an average of $11,834, down 1.02 percent over the 24 hours to press time.	1
Litecoin (LTC) outperformed all major cryptocurrency assets Wednesday, Feb. 14, jumping over 30 percent against the US dollar on combined LTC payment service and hard fork news. Having announced its intention to create a merchant solution for Litecoin similar to BitPay for Bitcoin in late 2017, a company called LitePay announced Monday, Feb. 12, that it would release the service on Feb. 26. ���We started because the people asked (BitPay) to accept LTC. They wouldn���t, so we took the challenge,��� the project explained in their tweet Monday. We started because the people asked @Bitpay to accept LTC. They wouldn���t, so we took the challenge. Infrastructure for LTC February 26 ?#PayWithLitecoin #LitePay Litecoin had broadly followed markets downward as Bitcoin���s fall since December, 2017 dictated altcoin asset performance. News earlier this month that a group of developers are planning to hard fork the Litecoin network for the first time to form ���Litecoin Cash��� on Feb. 19, 2017 sparked enthusiasm amongst traders. Price increases are also attributable to traders likely ���stocking up��� on LTC in order to benefit from the forthcoming ���airdrop��� of Litecoin Cash tokens. The announcement for Litecoin Cash promised a free allocation of 10 tokens per litecoin held by existing investors at the time of the fork. Its remit may be limited, however, after Litecoin creator Charlie Lee publicly stated any attempt to fork the network was a ���scam��� in a tweet Feb. 4. PSA: The Litecoin team and I are not forking Litecoin. Any forks that you hear about is a scam trying to confuse you to think it's related to Litecoin. Don't fall for it and definitely don't enter your private keys or seed into their website or client. Be careful out there! https://t.co/qXbiIxp5Al Elsewhere in the top cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin broke the $9000 mark to trade at $9,284 with average 7.7 percent gains in the 24 hours to press time. The majority of top 10 altcoins followed suit, climbing an average of about 7 percent. Monero, Stellar, and OmiseGo fared better still, appreciating up to 20 percent in the 24 hours to press time.	2
After hitting a multi-month low of $6,094 on Tuesday, Feb. 6, Bitcoin is rebounding substantially Wednesday, Feb. 7, pushing over $8,000, and pulling the top 100 altcoins up with it.  Image source: coin360.io Bitcoin���s price has gained about 24 percent in the 24 hours to press time, trading at an average of  $8,280, according to CoinMarketCap. Altcoins are also showing  robust growth, with all the top 100 coins in the green, gaining as much  97 percent over the last 24 hours to press time. In the top 10 coins, NEO and NEM have increased by 55 and 46 percent respectively, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH) gained up to 33 percent at press time. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is at $388 bln, seeing gains of over $100 billion since Tuesday���s low of $276.8 bln.  In addition to the general movement of the market, the rebound is can also be attributed to the outcome of the hearing on cryptocurrency and Blockchain held yesterday, Feb. 6, by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). During the hearing, CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo expressed optimism about Bitcoin with regard to the technology behind it, Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT):  ���If there was no Bitcoin, there would be no DLT.��� Cointelegraph correspondant Joseph Young tweeted this morning, Feb. 7, regarding the crypto market���s positive response to yesterday���s cryptocurrency hearing in the US: CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo's Twitter following increased by 7x since yesterday's cryptocurrency hearing.   Welcome to crypto Twitter @giancarloCFTC. pic.twitter.com/IsJynCyxf0 Yesterday, Feb. 6, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee tweeted about the overall volatility of the crypto markets and the benefits of staying bullish in the long-term, noting ���Those that can withstand such a drop without flinching are the ones with lambos eventually.

The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has assembled a team of 10 investigators for international crime investigations as well as for finding tax evaders who use cryptocurrency, Bloomberg reports Thursday, Feb. 8. Chief of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division Don Fort said that the team will work with international criminal agencies to investigate unlicensed exchanges as well: ���It���s possible to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the same fashion as foreign bank accounts to facilitate tax evasion.��� According to Fort, the group���s focus for now is on how crypto users change their fiat currency into crypto. ���We know that you want to get your money out at some point.��� In March 2014, the IRS began issuing guidance for the taxation of cryptocurrency, which they treated as a property that had capital gains or capital losses for tax purposes. However, only 802 people complied in filing their own cryptocurrency gains or losses for their taxes in 2015. The IRS has faced hurdles this year trying to get access through a court order to user information on the crypto exchange Coinbase. Their original request for records of over 500,000 users was denied by courts and reduced to just 14,000 users that reportedly had high trading activity over $20,000. Coinbase saw their partial victory as setting a precedent for the dealings between tax-enforcing government bodies and crypto exchanges that have a commitment to protecting user privacy. A Cointelegraph expert blog published in Dec. 2017 brought up the possibility of a tax amnesty for those who failed to report gains from digital currency earning, similar to a IRS program for filing income from undisclosed offshore accounts.	2
Peach Aviation, a low-cost airline in Japan, has confirmed that their plan to allow Bitcoin (BTC) as payment is only delayed, not cancelled. Peach Aviation had initially announced in May 2017 that customers would be able to use Bitcoin as a payment method by the end of the year. However, in December 2017, the plan was postponed until March 2018. The airline had partnered with crypto exchange BITpoint Japan for the new BTC payment system as well as for plans to open Bitcoin ATMs at airports around Japan. Japan has recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method in the country since April 2017. Japanese broadcasting corporation NHK World had published an article last week, which has since been removed, that cited Peach Aviation officials questioning the dependability of cryptocurrency after Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck was hacked for $534 mln in NEM, and in light of recent volatility in the markets. In response to the rumors that Peach Aviation would not follow through with their BTC payment option after the NHK article, the airline denied such a cancellation on their website, stating: ���There have been some reports today on our company retracting its plan to enable airline tickets to be purchased with Bitcoins; however, this is not something that was announced by our company and is not a fact. We are currently considering our start period in aiming to introduce such a service.��� Peach Aviation is not the first to accept Bitcoin as payment for flights. In July 2017, AirBaltic added the option to purchase flights with BTC. Singapore Airlines as recently as today, Feb. 5, announced a Blockchain-based frequent flyer app to be released in August 2018.	0
Controversial OneCoin has been declared a genuine cryptocurrency and ordered to be listed on coinmarketcap.com with immediate effect. The declaration followed the decision of Manuel Lin Miranda, Federal Circuit Court judge in California on Friday, March 31, 2017. The case which lasted a period of 14 months saw OneCoin creator, Dr. Ruja Ignatova and her team cleared of all allegations due to lack of substantive evidence by the prosecutor. A confident Ignatova tells Cointelegraph that the victory in court is not hers but a victory for the humanity and the cause of liberty. Ignatova says: ���This is not my victory, it is a victory for the entire people of the world. What we see here today is proof that purpose and goodwill will always prevail at the right time.��� The aftermath of this development has seen the newly recognized cryptocurrency display an unofficial market capitalization of over $13 bln, rising above Ethereum to become second only to Bitcoin. Supporters of the newly recognized cryptocurrency are enthusiastic and are quick to express their joy, explaining their resilience and steadfastness having encountered unprecedented trials during the days of uncertainty. A OneCoin user from Nigeria describes the development as an unimaginable miracle. Having invested over NGN10 mln in the project, he says that the hopelessness encountered before now took a toll even on his health. Worst of it all according to him is the mockery and blame received from the people around him over the last couple of months. ���It is a great turn-around. Somehow, I knew a day like this would come, my tears have now turned to joy. Our goal is to overtake Bitcoin and we are almost there. We are the new billionaires in town, thanks to our leader Dr. Ruja Ignatova.��� The entire crypto ecosystem has been thrown into panic as no one knows what to expect anymore. This development completely exhumes the almost completely buried question of how much of government interference can be experienced within the crypto environment. Unprecedented price volatility is far from being expected in the next couple of days across major cryptocurrencies because this is just a huge joke!	2
Cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service provider Coinbase has received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to list digital coins considered to be securities, Bloomberg reported July 16. A Coinbase representative told Bloomberg that the SEC and FINRA have authorized the exchange to acquire security dealers Keystone Capital Corp., Venovate Marketplace Inc. and Digital Wealth LLC. The deal will allow Coinbase to extend its offerings with security tokens and to operate as a broker dealer, an alternative trading system, and a registered investment adviser. Coinbase initially announced the acquisition plans on June 6. The spokesman reportedly said that Coinbase will now integrate its technology into the new subsidiaries, but did not reveal a timeline. Coinbase will need to verify that employees hold the necessary licenses and review how the firm reports data. Last week, the San Francisco-based exchange announced that it is exploring the addition of five new coins to its trading lists, including Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), and 0x (ZRX). Coinbase noted that it does not guarantee the new tokens will be listed for trading. In June, Coinbase announced it will support Ethereum Classic (ETC) and  ERC20 tokens. The company said then that its decision to add ERC20 ���paves the way for supporting ERC20 assets across Coinbase products in the future.��� In March, the SEC said that platforms trading digital assets deemed to be securities must register with the regulator as an exchange, and would subsequently be governed by the same rules as traditional exchanges. The SEC added that entities aiming to operate as an alternative trading system (ATS) are also subject to regulatory requirements: ���Registration as a broker-dealer subjects the ATS to a host of regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to have reasonable policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of material non-public information, books and records requirements, and financial responsibility rules, including, as applicable, requirements concerning the safeguarding and custody of customer funds and securities.���	2
Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway substantially cut their position on Wells Fargo, selling 100 million shares. The Oracle of Omaha is continuing to trim his position in bank stocks, buoying the bull case for gold and Bitcoin (BTC). Berkshire reportedly held $32 billion in equity in Wells Fargo at one point, Fox Business reported on Sep. 5. The investment conglomerate now owns 3.3% in equity of the lender, worth just $3.36 billion. Throughout his career, Buffett emphasized the importance of value investing and cash flow. The investor typically prefers businesses with predictable and stable operations that result in consistent profitability. In July, Wells Fargo posted a $2.4 billion loss, recording its first loss since the 2008 housing crisis. Following the disappointing quarterly report, the company said it would cut its dividend to 10 cents per share. This month, Moody���s cut its rating from stable to negative, citing the slow process to overhaul its governance. Allen Tischler, a Moody���s analyst said: ���The outlook change reflects Wells Fargo���s slower-than-anticipated pace in resolving its legacy governance, oversight, compliance, and operational risk management deficiencies. The slow pace weighs on its expense base, further undermining its earnings potential against the backdrop of challenging operating conditions.��� The confluence of the quarterly loss, the dividend cut, and the downgraded outlook likely led Buffett to trim his position. But the persistent theme in Berkshire���s portfolio reshuffle in recent months is its investment in Barrick Gold. While decreasing its exposure to the U.S. banking sector, Buffett invested in gold and Japanese trading companies. The decision shows that Buffett is seeking safety in terms of cash flow and a hedge against inflation. The Barrick Gold investment fuels the bull case of Bitcoin because the perception of BTC as a store of value is improving, especially given the tight correlation between the two since the March 2020 crash.  Bitcoin vs gold price. Source: Skew Other notable investors, including the Winklevoss twins, believe Bitcoin as ���digital gold��� would compete against gold over the long term. Specifically, its immense upside potential makes it an attractive investment since BTC market capitalization is still roughly only 1.5% of gold.  Cameron Winkelvoss, the co-founder of Gemini, said Bitcoin already made significant ground on gold. He said: ���Bitcoin has made significant ground on gold ��� going from white paper to over $200 billion in market capitalization in under a decade. It will continue to cannibalize gold dramatically over the next decade.��� As Cointelegraph Markets reported last Monday, Wall Street veteran and host of the Keiser Report, Max Keiser, believes Buffett exiting the dollar is a bullish signal for the price of gold and Bitcoin.  ���Buffett���s move into Japan, along with his gold investment, confirms he���s getting out of USD bigly,��� he said. ���Bitcoin - Gold - Silver Will all make new ATH in the near term.���	2
Carl-Ludwig Thiele, a board member for Bundesbank, one of the largest banks in Europe, has confirmed that the euro zone is not considering a digital currency. He said: ���Digital central bank money analogous to cash is currently not in sight.��� The statement runs contrary to a previous statement made by Jens Weidmann, the head of Bundesbank, suggesting that a digital currency comparable to Bitcoin could potentially protect European citizens. Thiele also warned investors that substantial losses were very possible. He stated: ���We are seeing a rapid increase in value, which brings the risk of rapid losses.��� The European Central Bank had already suggested regulating digital currencies like Bitcoin, in spite of previous statements that the government was powerless to regulate cryptocurrencies. Despite the rejection of the concept in the eurozone, other countries are still considering governmental cryptocurrencies. Russia and Dubai have both begun working toward nationalized digital currencies.	0
No-loss lotteries appear to have found a snug product-market fit.  Just a few days after the airdrop of their governance token, POOL, the self-styled ���savings game��� PoolTogether has cracked $50 million in total value locked with ease, currently sitting above $51 million spread between DAI, USDC, UNI, and COMP lottery pools.  PoolTogether aptly 'pools' user funds and deposits them into decentralized finance savings protocols, using the interest as prizes for randomly-selected winners and returning the initial funds to buyers ��� thus creating a ���no-loss��� lottery.  While the project stalled below $10 million in total value locked for months, growth has been explosive ever since the POOL governance token airdrop on February 17. According to a Tweet from the team, a day ago the project had $34 million in TVL ��� it has since grown 33%.  $34 million deposited!~$47,000 in no loss prizes being awarded this week! https://t.co/wYA1wO1NHY pic.twitter.com/lfpgu7bWZN PoolTogether founder Leighton Cusack points to the distribution model for POOL as a partial explainer for the protocol���s growth.  ���As part of the initial decentralization, 5% of total POOL supply (500,000 tokens) were allocated to be distributed automatically to all no loss prize pool depositors over the next 14 week,��� he said in an interview with Cointelegraph.  The distribution program, one which is conceptually similar to liquidity mining, is part of a larger effort to ���get the token into the hands of users.��� Cusack says that of the 1.5 million tokens airdropped on the 17th, (15% of the total supply), 600,000 have been claimed. Another reason for the growth is entirely organic, however: the more depositors, the more appealing the prize pool.  ���The prizes are MUCH larger than they have ever been. Right now the protocol is on track to aw1ard over $60,000 in prizes in the next 7 days. So the higher prizes is attracting more people to deposit,��� he said.  The next step for the protocol will be to build on the promising growth. Cusack says that integrating with more savings protocols and moving to a layer-2 in an effort to duck Ethereum���s rising gas fees are priorities, but ultimately those decisions are now out of his hands.  ���Since the protocol is now decentralized though, it's really up to members of the community to drive that process. There is a strong community around the protocol already and if you anyone wants to get involved just hop into the Discord.���	1
Although it may be hard to imagine, cryptocurrencies are far older than Blockchain technology. Most of us look at Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency, although it is only the first Blockchain-based currency. Cryptocurrencies like B-Money and BitGold existed prior to Bitcoin, however, these didn���t really go far, especially when judged against Bitcoin. The problem with cryptocurrencies conceived before Bitcoin was their centralized structure. Without Blockchain technology, there was no ���decentralized, immutable, transparent��� ledger in which transactions could be recorded, leading to a centralization. Yet it looks like Blockchain may not be the be-all, end-all of digital currency technologies. Recently, a new form of crypto has emerged that leverages the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) organizational model for the structure of its decentralized ledger, allowing old problems to be solved and new features to be added. Today, we���re going to take a look at the technology that can potentially replace the Blockchain itself and some of its current implementations. Although the implementations that we are going to discuss today are new, the concept is not. In a 2013 paper dubbed ���Accelerating Bitcoin���s Transaction Processing. Fast Money Grows on Trees, Not Chains,��� the authors Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar introduce the GHOST protocol which proposes a change to Bitcoin���s structure from a Blockchain into a tree, reducing confirmation times and improving security. Although this change has not been implemented in Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies are using the DAG-based system successfully. Let���s meet them! Byteball is a DAG-based cryptocurrency. The first of its kind, Byteball is distributed through an airdrop process in which GBYTE, the native currency in the network, is distributed according to the user���s Bitcoin holdings. Recently GBYTE distribution has also begun to take place through cashback partnerships with participating merchants. Although it���s refreshing to see an ICO-less cryptocurrency, its distribution method is one of the least interesting aspects of Byteball. In Byteball, there are no blocks. Instead, transactions are linked directly to each other and each transaction contains one or more hashes of previous transactions. The set of links between the transactions forms what is known as the DAG, as opposed to the ���Blockchain��� system used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There is no Proof of Work or Proof of Stake mining in Byteball. Instead of having subsequent blocks confirm previous ones, transactions are confirmed by new transactions that come after them.  But this kind of ���confirmation��� is only a confirmation that the transaction exists, not that it is not a double spend.   So, how are double spends resolved?  In PoW currencies, the conflicts caused by double spends are resolved by selecting the version of block history that has the most work committed to it.  In Byteball, since it is DAG-based, there is already partial order among transactions. This allows most double spends to be caught and rejected immediately. What if the double spends are on parallel branches of the DAG and their ordering is not evident? Then, Byteball uses ���Main Chain��� - a chain on the DAG that goes through transactions posted by known trusted users called witnesses.  Of the two conflicting transactions, the one that appears earlier on the Main Chain is deemed valid.  Witnesses are selected by the users themselves, who list their preferred witnesses with each transaction they post. Although there is still much to explain regarding Byteball and its DAG-based system, one thing becomes clear: This system is a viable alternative to Blockchain technology and can even solve some of the most prominent problems found in the technology, such as such as speed, sustainability, scalability, security, privacy and legal compliance. If the system becomes widely used, transactions become frequent, ensuring that they can be confirmed in mere seconds, as opposed to the 10 minute wait in Bitcoin. As for sustainability, the witness system employed by Byteball offers a security model in which no Proof of Work mining is required, meaning that electricity is not mindlessly wasted in order to secure it. Since Byteball does not have blocks, there is no block size issue. When compared with Ethereum, Byteball smart contracts are not as powerful and not Turing complete, but they are simple, allowing them to be displayed in user-readable form. This means that regular users can see what is actually going to happen to their money for themselves. Prediction markets are already working based on these contracts, and a recently introduced manual oracle feature allows anyone without technical knowledge to run a prediction market. As for privacy, other altcoins like Zcash and Dash have already come up with efficient ways of protecting user���s privacy. Nevertheless, it���s good to know that you can keep this privacy in a network that does not require long confirmation times or wasteful Proof of Work mining. Byteball allows value to be transferred privately through an asset called ���blackbytes.��� Lastly, legal compliance is addressed by Byteball through its asset issuing system. The whitepaper reads: ���Users can issue new assets and define rules that govern their transferability. The rules can include spending restrictions such as a requirement for each transfer to be cosigned by the issuer of the asset, which is one way for financial institutions to comply with existing regulations.��� IOTA is a unique cryptocurrency. Although it also uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) organizational model under the name ���Tangle,��� its implementation and applications differ wildly from Byteball. Designed specifically for the IoT (Internet of Things) industry, IOTA held a successful ICO in 2015, gathering 1,337 BTC and launched on Bitfinex earlier this year. Apart from its distribution method, IOTA has several differences when compared to Byteball. For example, in IOTA, all transactions created must validate a minimum of two previous transactions. In order to do so, users (who create and validate transactions) must solve a cryptographic puzzle similar to those found in Proof of Work cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, IOTA has no fees. Unlike Byteball, where GBYTE transaction fees are the same as the GB size of a transactions, IOTA charges no fees at all, regardless of the transaction size or amount. Instead, nodes are incentivized to participate in the creation and confirmation of transactions by other nodes who will drop nodes if they do not make transactions regularly. The lack of fees solves two critical problems in the eyes of the IOTA developers. The whitepaper reads: ���The importance of micropayments will increase in the rapidly developing IoT industry, and paying a fee that is larger than the amount of value being transferred is not logical. Furthermore, it is not easy to get rid of fees in the Blockchain infrastructure since they serve as an incentive for the creators of blocks. This leads to another issue with existing cryptocurrency technology, namely the heterogeneous nature of the system. There are two distinct types of participants in the system, those who issue transactions, and those who approve transactions. The design of this system creates unavoidable discrimination of some participants, which in turn creates conflicts that make all elements spend resources on conflict resolution. The aforementioned issues justify a search for solutions essentially different from Blockchain technology, the basis for Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.��� The lack of fees would normally create vectors for spam attacks on the network. In order to avoid this issue, IOTA employs a ���weight��� mechanism in which transactions are confirmed according to their weight. This weight is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node invested into it. IOTA���s weight system ensures that spam is not feasible as no entity can generate an abundance of transactions with ���acceptable��� weights in a short period of time. Despite the several differences between these two implementations of DAG-based cryptos, IOTA sets itself apart by its unique focus, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. If you���re not familiar with the IoT, the concept involves a global network where devices like home appliances, cars and so on are able to communicate and exchange data, allowing them to be remotely monitored and even controlled. IOTA���s goal is to allow value and data to be exchanged and transferred freely between these elements, allowing any IoT-enabled device, appliance, or vehicle to be used or rented in an efficient and trustless way. The data provided by devices can also be bought and sold through the IOTA network. This concept allows the distributed economy movement to evolve in such a way that anyone will be able to make the most out of their belongings. In short, IOTA acts as a backbone for the exchange of value on the IoT paradigm in which devices produce value for their owner and not the other way around. Will DAG-based cryptocurrencies replace Blockchain? It���s hard to tell. While there are evident advantages when it comes to these DAG systems, these are still far from being a popular alternative, and very few projects are working on it. Nevertheless, the projects that do seem to have earned their place in the cryptosphere, especially IOTA, a top-15 cryptocurrency by market capitalization.	1
You may have noticed the increase in Segwit2x news, opinion, posts, rants, and memes circulating throughout various media sources. You may have seen some of this media and been completely lost, as if you were reading a different language. The entire debate can get pretty technical and you may be wondering if you should be concerned by the increasing number of rants you see on r/Bitcoin regarding the fork. To make Segwit2x clear, I will be breaking down the hardfork and putting it in layman���s terms. We will call today���s version of Bitcoin ���legacy Bitcoin.��� Right now, there is a 1 MB limit to the size of blocks. This was done by Satoshi to keep network nodes from coming under attack when Bitcoin was very young. He picked 1 MB as the limit because blocks were 99% empty at the time, and he expected there would be plenty of time to upgrade the system later when needed. As Bitcoin grew more popular, the network had so many transactions to process that the transactions were beginning to pile up and form a queue. Blocks are discovered roughly every ten minutes, but in ten minutes��� time, there were more than 1 MB of transactions, causing some to be delayed until a future, emptier block could be mined. The congestion caused delays in the amount of time it took for a transaction to be verified and applied pressure on the senders in a transaction to increase their transaction (tx) fee. This fee incentivizes miners to include that transaction in the current block. As blocks filled up, the fee needed to be included in a new block rose proportionally. Bitcoin transactions began to get very expensive, if senders paid higher fees, or very slow, if senders chose to pay lesser fees. Bitcoin���s Core developers eventually came up with a solution: Segregated Witness (SegWit). SegWit is included in Bitcoin���s current software. It works by separating the transaction data from the signature data; this packs up to four times as many transactions into a block. More importantly, SegWit fixed a few other bugs within the software and that sets the stage for potential future upgrades to the network like the lightning network. Not everybody was happy with just implementing SegWit, and preferred to increase the maximum size of Bitcoin���s blocks as well. This would give the network some more room for growth while lightning network was being deployed. Bitcoin���s Core developers do not want to increase the block size, primarily because that involves a hard fork, which is potentially dangerous. A hard fork happens when computers running new versions of the software are no longer compatible with computers that run the old (legacy) version. If done incorrectly, this can cause really bad things to happen. On May 23rd, 2017, the Digital Currency Group published the New York Agreement (NYA). The New York Agreement was signed by a large number of Bitcoin companies and by miners representing over 80% of Bitcoin���s hashpower. The signatories of the agreement accepted a compromise called SegWit2x. This plan would call for the near-immediate activation of SegWit, and would follow that with a hard fork in November to double the block size. One of the main concerns people have is that SegWit2x does not provide replay protection (until recently, when Jeff Garzik, the overseer of development for SegWitx, introduced an opt-in replay protection scheme). A replay attack works as follows. Following a fork, if Bob sends Alice 10 Bitcoins on the forked chain, an attacker can copy that transaction onto the legacy chain and cause Bob to send 10 Bitcoins on that chain as well. Because SegWit2x does not include replay protection--unless you opt in--the Segwit2x fork leaves users susceptible to a replay attack. Core developers believe that this hardfork is coming too fast (three months after implementing SegWit) and that for a hardfork to take place and be accepted, it requires a lot of time to prep the community and reach a consensus regarding the fork. Many members of the crypto community dislike hard forks because hard forks weaken what is supposed to be a united decentralized community (I know, a bit ironic). SegWit2x is a hard fork that will occur around November 16, 2017, and as a result of the hardfork there will be two chains, one will be Bitcoin Core (legacy Bitcoin) and the other will be the SegWit2x version of Bitcoin. If the fork continues to be supported by the overwhelming majority of miners, there will be serious confusion over which chain is the ���real��� Bitcoin. Although people in the crypto community love to freak out and rant on medium.com, reddit.com, and twitter.com, there is really no reason to be worried about this upcoming fork. Remember, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin in existence--Bitcoin is a finite resource--a deflationary currency. Once the dust settles, everything should be fine. However, for safety reasons, it is always best to hold your own private key. This safety precaution should be heeded particularly during a hard fork. If you hold your funds on a wallet hosted online, such as an exchange like Coinbase, it is never certain what will happen with your funds if things go wrong on their servers--and we all know that things sometimes go wrong there.	1
Known for embracing all things edgy, musician Bjork has announced that her latest album, Utopia, will be available for purchase through cryptocurrencies. The artist will accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, DASH, and AudioCoin. The move by the musician may seem like a marketing strategy of sorts to appear unique and to draw attention during a time when Bitcoin���s rise has brought cryptocurrencies into the mainstream. However, according to Kevin Bacon of Blockpool: "This really isn���t a marketing strategy with Bj��rk. This is a decision to be a leader. In fact, it���s just the obvious thing to do for her. If I wasn���t involved in this project, I���d expect Bj��rk to be a leader in this area, and for her team to be doing creative things with crypto.��� As adoption of cryptocurrencies increases, the price and number of transactions increase, causing greater price stability, and stability increases mainstream adoption. This process of adoption and stability has been referred to as a Satoshi cycle, and is the underlying driver for the increase in Bitcoin price. Bjork���s album offering is simply another step in the ladder of adoption and stability. As the cryptocurrency market continues to gain traction, prices follow the adoption curve and drive the adoption curve concurrently.	1
Some of the earliest mined Bitcoin just moved for the first time in 11 years. A Bitcoin (BTC) address containing coins mined in February 2009 ��� barely one month after the launch of the Bitcoin mainnet ��� just swept its entire holdings to two different Bitcoin wallets.  Source: Blockchair.com Of these, 40 are laying inactive on what appears to be a change address. The remaining 10 BTC have been sent to a multisig address, as evidenced by its starting number. The chain of transactions becomes more difficult to track from here, since the BTC were split into numerous pieces across a complex chain of outputs. The early wallet contained a coinbase transaction generating 50 BTC, which were mined on Feb. 9, 2009.  It is speculated in the community that Satoshi���s ���fortune��� is spread between many different wallets, each containing a Coinbase transaction. Very few people are known to have been mining using the original Bitcoin client so early in Bitcoin���s history. Theories on the possible owner of these funds include Hal Finney���s family, Martti Malmi, and even Satoshi Nakamoto himself. The complex chain of transactions suggests that the signer seeks to conceal the destination of the funds. It is also theoretically possible, but extremely unlikely, that an external actor brute forced the private key to this wallet. The story will be updated as more information comes in.	1
Stories of hyperinflation in various countries have been mounting in recent days. As citizens face the reality that their country has devalued its currency, they are forced to take backpacks of cash to buy a loaf of bread. Within these devalued currency environments, other forms of money--stable ones--are welcomed. Zimbabwe is one such nation. There, hyperinflation reached a critical point in 2008, and is threatening again. The country appears to be headed toward another bout of hyperinflation and citizens are turning to dollars and Bitcoin. The use of Bitcoin in Zimbabwe has grown exponentially as the government has begun to stop all credit card payments and has restricted the flow of cash into and out of the country. People wishing to make payments for vehicles have been forced to use Bitcoin and car lenders are happy to accept. In all the chaos, the price of Bitcoin on the local exchange, BitcoinFundi, has soared to $7,200. This premium reflects a frantic desire to find ways to transact within an economy where government controls have made traditional means impossible. Recent reports from Venezuela, where hyperinflation is actively routing the economy, indicate that a similar rise in Bitcoin usage has taken place. Citizens have been forced to turn to non-governmental sources for business purposes, leading to suggestions that such economies could face ���Bitcoinization���.	1
The first ever physical transaction may have been completed on the Lighting Network two days ago, according to Reddit user /u/btc_throwaway1337, who purchased a VPN Router through a payment channel provided by TorGuard. The Lightning Network, designed to scale Bitcoin up for a global user base, functions by opening and recording a channel between two users on the Blockchain, with information about transactions only being recorded on the original Bitcoin Blockchain after the channel is closed. The Reddit user explained that he saw a tweet by TorGuard offering the service: ATT BTC Users: TorGuard now accepts mainnet Lightning Network BTC payments. Ask support for details! #bitcoin #lightning pic.twitter.com/6agWGvc5XM According to his post, the buyer opened a channel and completed the instantaneous transaction, amazingly without paying anything in fees. He said: ���I���m just your average BTC enthusiast, who had a bit of extra time last weekend. I saw TorGuard���s tweet, so I decided to contact them. I enquired as to purchasing more than just a monthly subscription, their staff gave me LN peering information, I opened a channel, received an invoice, and here we are! It was all quick, easy, painless, and most importantly: instantaneous and fee-free!��� With the information public, TorGuard did offer a warning to users regarding the c-lightning network, stating that it is not yet ���production ready���. The company offered to cover any loss of funds that may result from using the system. Disclaimer: c-lightning is not production ready. TorGuard will cover loss of funds when sending us LN payments. Testnet is so boring. The completion of the first ever physical purchase on the Lightning Network is a significant milestone in the development of Bitcoin, akin to the famous pizza day. Over the past several years, the increasing transaction fees and times on the Bitcoin network have made direct Bitcoin purchases of low-price items nearly impossible, forcing users to switch to other cryptocurrencies. The option to send near-instant, fee-free transactions might re-enable small purchases to be made directly with Bitcoin.	1
Bitcoin payment service provider BitPay has announced Friday, Dec. 22, that it is updating the minimum payment amount on its platform from $5 to $100, only to retract the change two days later, as reported in a blog post on Sunday. BitPay has shared an update Dec. 22, notifying its users that the platform will no longer process invoices that are less than $100 equivalent in Bitcoin, a vast increase over the previous limit of $5. The company cited unprecedented Bitcoin transaction volume and the resulting record-high network congestion and miner fees as the reason for this change. The blog post states: ���Bitcoin miner fees are now more than $30 per transaction on average ��� Bitcoin payments under $100 are quickly becoming impractical for users to send and for BitPay to process.��� It was further specified that the change ���does not affect person to person payments in the BitPay wallet��� and ���only [affects] payments to BitPay merchants and Bitcoin-to-dollar loads for the BitPay Card.��� However, just two days later, the payment processor has retracted the change, returning the minimum invoice limit back to its previous value of $5, based on a claim that ���Payment Protocol improvements��� recently implemented on the platform have allowed it to do so. ���We do not have plans for further immediate changes to the minimum BitPay invoice amount,��� the announcement continued. Notably, the company has still not implemented support for the SegWit scaling solution on its platform as of Dec. 25, despite admitting that it would help increase the capacity of the network and allow ���an average Bitcoin miner fee reduction of over 40 percent.��� This failure to enable SegWit support four months after it has been activated on the Bitcoin network has resulted in a degree of frustration for the users of BitPay, as almost every single person replying to the company���s latest announcement on Twitter is asking for the urgent addition of the scaling solution: SegWit - do it Have you guys implemented segwit to help with the situation?	1
Eth2���s beacon chain genesis has been confirmed for Dec. 1 following the transfer of 524,288 Ether (ETH) from 16,384 validators into the Eth2 deposit contract since it went live on Nov. 4. Despite early concerns stemming from low staking participation, transfers to the deposit contract rapidly increased over the past day, with more than 200,000 ETH sent to the contract in the past 14 hours. Ethereum 2.0���s beacon chain genesis is now set to take place on the earliest possible launch date of Dec. 1, with genesis taking place seven days after the required deposit contract���s threshold was met. Every single Etherean right now pic.twitter.com/ACqF7laFfG While genesis participants will not be able to withdraw their coins until ETH 2.0 reaches Phase 1.5 ��� which will merge the Ethereum mainnet with Eth2���s beacon chain and sharded environment ��� many hodlers are waiting for third parties to launch withdrawal-enabled staking services, despite the potential risk of exit scams.

An individual Ether (ETH) miner struck it big by mining a block on their own and receiving a reward valued at about $540,000.  The miner was operating through the 2Miners: Solo pool on Monday when they mined an entire block and received 168 ETH. That reward vastly outstrips the per-block average reward of about 4 ETH according to BitInfoCharts. Adding to the remarkable nature of the reward is the size and hash power of the Solo pool. It is relatively small with 854 miners online and 1.5 terahashes per second at the time of writing, meaning that the average miner contributes 1.85 gigahashes per second (GH/s). The lucky miner currently contributes 2.25 GH/s, which could be generated with one to 20 of the latest GPU devices. Hash power is the amount of computer processing power a device contributes to a proof-of-work blockchain like Ethereum and Bitcoin. More hash power helps secure the network by processing transactions and mining blocks. The lucky jackpot on the Ethereum network marks the third time in two weeks that an individual crypto miner has hit the big time. A Bitcoin (BTC) miner from the Solo CK anonymous solo mining operation raked in 6.25 BTC for mining an entire block on their own on Jan. 11.  Two days later, another solo miner, using Solo CK again, mined a new block on Bitcoin with only one to three rigs.  Each miner had a 1 in 1,400,000 chance of mining an entire block, and the chances of two tiny miners managing the same feat in the same week have been estimated at 1 in 1 billion. Average daily Ethereum mining profitability has been on a decline since it spiked to an all-time high of $0.282 on May 12, 2021. Average profitability is now about $0.0474, according to BitInfoCharts. This is partly due to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which burns fees instead of distributing them to miners. A jackpot reward like the one earlier this week may be consigned to the past when the Ethereum network completes ���the merge,��� referring to its move to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. With PoS, network stability is maintained by staking tokens. This will reduce the electrical resource requirements of the network.	1
Ryan Watkins, a senior research analyst at crypto analysis firm Messari, has speculated that Ether (ETH) could overtake Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest crypto asset once its Eth2 and proof-of-stake overhaul is complete. Appearing on YouTube show FinTech Today on March 18, Watkins noted that while he does not know ���if or when��� Ether will flip Bitcoin, he does believe Ether could emerge as the leading crypto asset in the future, due to Eth2, stating: Watkins also emphasized Ether���s changing underlying economics amid the Eth2 transition, highlighting expectations that Ethereum���s forthcoming burn mechanism will result in Ether being destroyed at a rate exceeding the creation of new supply. He posted the question: ���If Ethereum is more secure and it [has] a stronger monetary policy, well then what is the bull case for Bitcoin in this scenario?��� Watkins also noted the ���massive��� and ���diverse��� economy being built on Ethereum, suggesting the network���s booming decentralized application sector will attract new users at a greater pace than Bitcoin over time. ���At a certain point, the economy of Ethereum begins to attract so much capital, both human capital and financial capital, that it is actually a force in the global economy,��� he said. ���The GDP of Ethereum is actually rivaling many large countries.��� ���People can earn livings in this economy,��� he added. According to Blockchain Center���s ���Flippening Index,��� which uses eight metrics to measure Ethereum���s strength relative to Bitcoin, Ethereum is currently 65.6% as strong as Bitcoin ��� having retraced from an all-time high of 72.3% in early February. The index suggests Ethereum has already overtaken Bitcoin by node count, transaction count and total transaction fees.	2
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) confirmed Friday that CME Group and CBOE had met the requirements for regulated trading, while Cantor Exchange would also be able to debut Bitcoin binary options. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the price of an asset without actually having to own the asset. The speculators profit by buying or selling a contract in anticipation of the asset���s price moving in a certain direction. In CME Group���s Bitcoin futures market--that they expect to have up and running by the end of Q4-each contract will represent five Bitcoins. If a trader is selling their contract, they are called a short speculator, if a trader is buying a contract, they are called a long speculator. Although there is often a minimum number of contracts that a trader must purchase, to keep this example simple, let's say Bob wants to buy one contract and the price is $50,000 ($10,000 per Bitcoin). Before Bob owns the contract, Bob will need to deposit the initial margin.  The initial margin is often called a ���good faith��� deposit. Similar to a down-payment, a good faith deposit is a deposit into a trader���s account that shows that the trader intends to follow through with their contract. The initial margin is a percentage of the total contract that is often around five to 10 percent of the total contract. If Bob���s initial margin is 10 percent, Bob will own the contract after he deposits $5,000 into his trading account. Now let���s assume Bob deposits $5,000 to buy the contract and is a long-speculator, meaning he believes/hopes Bitcoin price will rise above the spot price he paid for his contract--10,000 per Bitcoin. CME Group has set the tick--the minimum price movement of the trading instrument--for their Bitcoin contracts at $5.00. This means that if Bitcoin price increases by $4, Bob  will not realize a gain/loss on his contract, because $4 is below the minimum tick. However, each time Bitcoin price increases by $5, Bob will gain/lose $25 on his contract (because each contract is composed of five Bitcoin) The day after Bob Purchases his contract, let���s say Bitcoin price rises by $100 . Because Bob owns one contract,  the minimum tick is $5, and with each tick Bob earns $25, Bob will gain $500 on his contract (20*)(25)=$500. On the other hand, if Bitcoin price declined by $100 during the trading day, Bob���s would lose $500 on his contract and Bob will see the funds in his trading account diminish. Keep in mind, Bob only paid $5,000 to become the owner of a contract worth $50,000. The $40,000 that Bob did not have to pay is borrowed money, in other words, Bob���s Bitcoin contract is leveraged. Because futures contracts are highly leveraged, investing in futures is considered very risky. Now let���s imagine that after four weeks the Bitcoin index (price) increases by five percent or in other words, 500 index points. After four weeks, Bob has earned a profit of $5.00(500)=$2,500 viz. Bob has earned a 50 percent profit on his initial deposit. On the other hand, if the indexed declined by five percent Bob will lose $2,500, a 50 percent loss on his contract. The more contracts a futures trader owns, the greater that trader���s risk. If the price decreases by a significant amount it is possible for Bob to lose even more money than he initially deposited for the initial margin. Bob���s initial margin was 5,000 dollars, now instead of Bitcoin price rising by 100, let���s say Bitcoin price falls by $1,100, Bob���s account will be credited $5,500 at the end of the trading day. Now remember, Bob���s initial margin was $5,000. Because of his $5,500 dollar loss, he will be 500 dollars in debt to CME Group and will have to pay out of his own pocket to bring is trading account balance back to zero. If Bob suffers a loss or a series of losses that deplete his initial margin to an amount lower than the maintenance margin--the lowest amount of money the broker allows Bob���s account to reach before requiring Bob to replenish his account-- Bob will receive a margin call from his broker, telling him to deposit the sufficient amount of funds to return him to the initial margin amount. To mitigate some of the risk involved with Bitcoin���s volatility, the CME Group has placed price limits on Bitcoin Futures. Bitcoin futures will be subject to price fluctuation limits of seven percent, 13 percent, and 20 percent. When the price of a contract fluctuates +/- 7% to the prior settlement price--the price that Bitcoin was valued at when the market closed the previous trading day-- a  two minute monitoring period will begin where contracts will continue to trade, however, within the +/- 7% boundary. If at the end of that two minute monitoring period, the price is still at the limit down or limit up, a two minute halt on trading will begin. During the two-minute halt traders will be able to create market orders, however, they will not be fulfilled until the two minute halt period is over. Afterwards, the price limit will expand to 13 percent without a halt period and will be hard capped at 20 percent without a halt period. However, If the price fluctuates to 20 percent, trading for the rest of the day must occur within the +/- 20% limit. CME Group���s Bitcoin Futures are currently pending regulatory approval, however, if approved, CME will be launching their futures before the end of Q4. CME���s decision to launch Bitcoin futures will most likely cause a number of big banks to keep their eye on Bitcoin. The CBOE has already discussed plans to launch a Bitcoin futures market, and Nasdaq expects to launch their Bitcoin futures market in the first half of 2018. It is likely that many institutional investors are going to be keeping an eye on CME to see how Bitcoin futures pan out.	2
Defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has formally entered civil rehabilitation proceedings, officials announced June 22. A statement and accompanying documentation confirm the move, which will see attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi act as civil rehabilitation trustee. Kobayashi was responsible for selling vast tranches of Bitcoin reserves beginning Q4 last year to reimburse Mt. Gox users who lost money in the exchange���s mass hack in late 2013. The sell-offs appeared to have a conspicuous effect on markets, Bitcoin prices tumbling immediately following each transaction, which Kobayashi performed on major exchanges. ���The power and authority to administer and dispose of MTGOX���s assets is still vested exclusively in me, and I will implement the civil rehabilitation proceedings, including the administration of MTGOX���s assets and the investigation of claims, subject to the Tokyo District Court���s supervision,��� Kobayashi wrote in the new documentation. However, due to the bankruptcy proceedings now being halted as part of the civil rehabilitation, Kobayashi will not sell any further bitcoins, with users set to receive compensation in BTC instead of fiat currency as originally intended. ���...In the civil 2 rehabilitation proceedings in this matter, claims seeking a refund of Bitcoins (���Bitcoin Claims���) will also not be converted into monetary claims after the commencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings,��� Kobayashi continues. Court approves Mt. Gox civil rehab. Mostly good news:  1) Trustee won���t sell more BTC  2) Creditors receive BTC (not JPY) in early-mid 2019  3) Everyone must refile claims by Oct  4) Bad news: some creditors will sell BTC, so that will hang over market next yrhttps://t.co/gc8SW5tnER https://t.co/3AC49MvEVI Reacting to the news, a group of claimants who had established Mt. Gox Creditors lobby group out of dissatisfaction with progress considered it a mixed blessing. ���...Enormous assets, which were to be distributed to Mt. Gox���s shareholders under the bankruptcy proceedings, will be returned to creditors of Mt.Gox in civil rehabilitation proceedings. This is the creditors��� victory,��� a statement from the group reads. ���...However, this victory has not been realized yet. The victory will come to creditors when Mt. Gox makes payment to creditors and creditors actually receive such payment.��� Mt. Gox became infamous in the crypto industry after suffering a hack, followed by a collapse in 2014, resulting in the loss of $473 million worth of customers��� money - the single largest loss of funds in the history of crypto until this year���s $534 million Coincheck hack.	1
Idaho lawmakers have told the public to ���look beyond the headlines��� so they can ���understand the risks��� posed by investing in cryptocurrency. In an official news release Thursday, the state���s Department of Finance (DATE) quoted director Gavin Lee saying investors should avoid ���hype��� when products or services involving cryptocurrency of any kind are involved. He warned: ���Investors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptocurrency futures contracts and other financial products where these virtual currencies are linked in some way to the underlying investment.��� In issuing the warning, Idaho joins the growing regulatory patchwork in effect across the US, with different states adopting fragmented attitudes towards virtual currency. Alaska also entered the fray this week, with Division of Banking and Securities director Kevin Anselm telling residents to exercise caution. ���We���re seeing a number of people contacted by sellers of virtual currencies or sellers that want people to get in on initial coin offerings, including virtual currencies.��� At the national level, traders are waiting with bated breath for what may be a breakout year for Bitcoin-related financial instruments in 2018. The long-awaited Bitcoin ETF could be approved this year, rumors have suggested, following strong sentiment following the debut of Bitcoin futures trading last month.	0
Bitcoin is a next-gen, all-digital currency that���s already a global phenomenon. Developed with high levels of security and anonymity in mind, it���s touted as a potential replacement for paper- and coin-based money in the near future. Some industries, including real estate, are capitalizing on this emerging trend by letting clients buy property via Bitcoin. It���s a significant departure from tradition, but it���s one that is quickly gaining momentum. A Miami man recently made news by selling his home in Coral Gables for over $6 mln ��� or approximately 1,600 BTC. The steep selling price is enough to rattle the headlines, but Bitcoin has been a part of the Miami real estate market for several years. Although it was only launched in 2009, tech-savvy real estate agents, investors and buyers quickly embraced the new cryptocurrency. Realtors in the area are confident that South Florida ��� particularly Miami ��� is an ideal market for Bitcoin. They cite the worldwide reach of Bitcoin as a primary factor in driving increased interest and attention to the region. Using an alternate form of currency opens up properties to buyers and investors from all over the world, including Asia, Canada, South America and more. The United States isn���t the only country to capitalize on the growing Bitcoin trend. A developer located on the Isle of Man recently announced plans for a joint residential-commercial development valued at $325 mln. Prospective residents will be able to use Bitcoin to purchase their property, with studio apartments starting at 33 BTC and one-bedroom apartments from 54 BTC ��� or approximately $250,000. Some of the development���s units have already been sold for modern currency, but the remaining residential properties are reserved for Bitcoin purchases. Commercial units are not currently available for purchase via the popular cryptocurrency. Investors and real estate agents in The Big Apple also believe Bitcoin is the way of the future. The team with Magnum Real Estate is assuming a huge risk by accepting Bitcoin for deposits and purchases for recently converted apartments in Manhattan���s East Village. Known as Liberty Toye, the property represents a huge shift in the way we conduct business this century. Real estate investment trusts have been looking to diversify their portfolios this year, and New York City provides the ideal launching ground. Known as an entrepreneurial-minded city that isn���t afraid to take risks, we already see homes and apartments available for Bitcoin. It���s only a matter of time until commercial buildings follow suit. The popular vacation destination of Lake Tahoe accepts Bitcoin, too. An unnamed buyer recently purchased a 1.4-acre property with Bitcoin on a 42-site resort. The undeveloped property sold for $1.6 mln, or 2,739 BTC, making it the largest Bitcoin-driven real estate transaction at the time it happened in 2013. According to reports, the Bitcoin purchase was originally the buyer���s idea. While we haven���t seen any further developments involving Bitcoin in the Lake Tahoe real estate market, the sale shows off the potential of digital currency in the industry and opens the way for future deals in both the residential and commercial sectors. The island of Indonesia isn���t the first place you���d expect to see a Bitcoin-backed real estate transaction, but it was actually among the first locations to support the cryptocurrency. An unnamed buyer spent more than 800 Bitcoins, totaling approximately $500,000 at the time, for a villa in Bali. Although residential real estate agents and buyers are comfortable with using Bitcoin to purchase real estate in Bali, we have yet to see any listings in the commercial or industrial markets. Despite the uncertainty of the Bitcoin market, tech-savvy investors and agents are ��� at least for the time being ��� willing to take a risk on the cryptocurrency. There are many advantages in doing so, but the risks are too steep for some to take the plunge.	2
Cointelegraph ranks the top players of cryptocurrency and Blockchain, presenting the people responsible for making our more than $400 bln industry into what it is today. What are the criteria, you ask? Without taking any liberties, we simply calculated the number of mentions each of the participants received in the mainstream ratings, such as Forbes��� and Fortune���s. The story of cryptocurrency and Blockchain has been one of innovators and pioneers. While there has been no shortage of starts and stops, the industry has grown from humble beginnings to a global phenomenon in less than a decade. Last year saw remarkable growth in interest towards crypto, driving prices in the markets to record-setting highs. At one point Bitcoin has gone beyond $20,000, while other coins such as Ethereum also saw massive gains. We owe it to dozens of innovators and advocates for helping the industry grow and turn into what it is today. Among them you���ll no doubt find familiar faces. Bitcoin guru Andreas Antonopoulos has brought Bitcoin to the masses with his book ���Mastering Bitcoin���. Roger Ver was one of the first investors in Blockchain and helped grow the industry as a prominent advocate. Vitalik Buterin, while having only spent 7 years in the crypto industry, has contributed massively, helping create the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum in 2014. We���ve also included people in the media affecting how the world is seeing and talking about cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology. These include such prominent advocates like Laura Shin and Perianne Boring. See how we���ve ranked the top influencers that are shaping the future of money. Aaron Wood	1
Our London Correspondent Nick Ayton, the Sage of Shoreditch, explores the infighting at Tezos that reveals the ICOs structural challenges. Some suggest the SEC might demand Tezos��� founders refund investors��� money...all $232 mln of it. Apparently there are some deep seated personal and structural issues with how the token sale was structured, marketed and executed that will be a lesson for us all. Why are being raised the suspicions that some investors allowed to exit with profits? How was the $150m valuation arrived at? What was Tim Draper���s role? Might investors have simply been misled and was there a role here for the hype and dumb people? And the big one, is the Tezos token really a security? And why was the token not registered with the SEC? Tezos was intended to deliver a self-amending crypto ledger technology and improve on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, boosting security and trust. This is a bit rich given what appears to have been going on behind the scenes. A quote from Tezos sale website will come as little comfort and a kick in the teeth for investors. ���Tezos was built on the belief that a deep commitment to security, formal verification and governance that gives stakeholders the power to make protocol decisions is the formula for earning trust and generating widespread adoption on the blockchain��� Earning trust, deep commitment, governance are very strong statements but clearly don���t apply to how investors may have been treated or the behaviour of the founders and their VC partners. Tezos is owned by DLS (Dynamic Ledger Solutions), which is in turn owned by husband and wife Arthur and Kathleen Breitman and venture capital partners. It was later disclosed the VC was given a pre discount months before the ICO and then after the sale with 8.5% going the Mr and Mrs Breitman and billionaire Tim Draper. The main sale happened in the summer of 2017 but pre deals were done as far back as September 2016 valuing the company at $6m without actually having an code ready to be released, barely in alpha. And then as the ICO approached, Tezos was being valued at $150m - whereby Draper might have been exited his $6 mln investment in DLS and doubled his money. Isn���t it always the case that when a VC gets involved we should become suspicious as they are sure to tip the balance in their favour as the industry once again demonstrates that greed dictates their behaviours? It is clear the strategy to use the Draper���s name helped launch the ICO, but what retail investors didn���t know was that he would not be investing for the long term and had a preferential deal. Many questions remain unanswered and I am sure the SEC will be concerned primarily because investors may have thought they were investing alongside Mr Draper that will have influenced their decision to invest, when this was not the case... Since the end of the ICO there has been a diversion of funds to various corporate structures and foundations. But the biggest issue is clearly the early profit taking for DLS and others ahead of retail investors, way before the venture has delivered anything substantial. The most significant structural change is that Tezos��� IP is transferring to a Foundation structure but the founders will hold 10% of all tokens generated at ICO, with no doubt the bulk being BTC that has enjoyed a huge capital gain and essentially doubled their money. One has to ask where was the lock-in for the founders and the commitment to deliver what was promised in the White Paper to retail investors?  Is this a clear warning for future ICO token buyers (of app tokens) and investors (securities tokens)? Why should Mr and Mrs Breitman and the VCs be rewarded before the Tezos proposition deliver on promises made - keeping in mind it has NO customers yet! It is also worth remembering that Tezos would need to become a multi billion dollar corporation to be able to return the $232 mln plus a decent premium to investors. And there is an expectation the founders should reveal their full business plans to show investors how they intend to build the business and secure its value. A long shot when Tezos is competing for airtime and there are several others Blockchains emerging that claims to do what Tezos promises��� As it turns out, Tezos tokens most likely will not deliver for investors not only because it allowed profit taking via a deep discount pre sale but worst of all, because the token sale was uncapped. Of course the biggest problem with uncapped token sales is you immediately limit the after or secondary market and that can hurt liquidity. If the Tezos sale was capped at $100 mln then technically the investors that comprise the $130 mln that missed out would seek to buy the tokens in the market which would help the Tezos tokens market value and therefore reward early retail investors. It is also clear the tokenomics were designed to deliver for early investors and the founders but not for the crowd of investors that placed faith in the management team to build out a new technology and lock in the value. There was a vesting period for the husband and wife team but not as part of any formal Employment Contract, where there are expectations for delivery. Instead, the vesting period is merely programmed into a smart contract that releases 1/48th of their holding monthly over four years without regard for how well they do their job. Please keep in mind they still have no customers or working production systems! The Brietmans clearly think very little of their investors. Should any refund include the full repayment of ETH plus any capital gains made from the recent rise in BTC and ETH?  As it was clear investors handed over their BTC and ETH in good faith (thinking Tim Draper was alongside them) and they missed out on the recent rise in cryptocurrency values. The Brietmans have made their money so why would they stick around to make good on the White Paper? Now we find income from the ICO is being diverted into projects that are intended to prop up the original investment and generate returns for investors (and it seems more for the founders) - making it look like Tezos is also active and attractive. Is it Ponzi Scheme or not? You decide.. Kathleen Brietman is also a former member of Bridgewater Associates, the world���s largest hedge fund and she is involved in the mechanics of DLS. And yet despite the funds raised there is little to show how the Tezos team have scaled their operations or the development efforts to get the tech to market to be used by real customers. As an advocate of ICOs and Libertarian, I find the Tezos position very disappointing. We are all reminded that the greed of the few could ruin it for everyone. Even worse, VCs were involved, and they should know the rules and know better! In the case of Tezos, once again greed seems to have gotten the better of everyone, and retail investors were hung out to dry. It is worth reminding everyone there are some founders who engineer an ICO to make money for themselves and not for investors, as the Tezos situation indicates. What is surprising is that with lawyers, VC���s, hedge funds and a board of advisors in tow, the Tezos founders were nonetheless allowed to create a money making structure that would bleed retail investors, allowing early investors the opportunity to ���flip��� and get out, taking profits from retail ICO money. With several ICO projects raising $100 mln, $200 mln and more questions will be asked.   With so much money at stake, the warning signs for future investors are there. In short, beware chasing quick returns, trying to buy into the next big technology thing on the Blockchain. The problems with Tezos highlights the need for structural changes to the ICO process, beyond merely declaring the token a security and making sure the jurisdictional laws are applied and existing banking and payment laws are not breached. For many ICOs the single biggest problem is governance, or a lack of it, closely followed by clarity of how the founders��� feet will be held to the fire to ensure they deliver what was promised for investors. There should be control of funds, and then we have the vesting period, both for founders and investors.  When are they allowed to get out, and should all terms be ���pari passu��� where all investors are treated the same? Then there are the pre sales, pre ICO discounts that many now see as either a Ponzi structure that works against retail investors, creating an uneven playing field that will suit the bigger and institutional investors. Now look, offering discounts, founders taking tokens and institutional investors getting involved or the odd big name is all fine, provided everything is disclosed upfront and the necessary controls and checks are put in place to protect retail investors and the value of the token. Don���t make the same mistakes.	1
Ben Bernanke, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his views against Bitcoin clear at a conference organized by Ripple in Toronto. Echoing the views of J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Bernanke feels that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, which puts it outside government control, will trigger its downfall. Speaking at Swell, a three day conference organized by Ripple in Toronto, Bernanke said: ���Bitcoin is an attempt to replace fiat currency and evade regulation and government intervention. I don���t think that���s going to be a success.��� He attributed the current run up in price of Bitcoin to its speculative nature and felt that Bitcoin hasn't proven itself as a transactional currency. In his opinion the government will eventually step in to prevent Bitcoin from rivalling fiat currency. While dismissing the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a successful alternative to fiat currency, Bernanke was all praise for the Blockchain. As reported by Fortune, Bernanke said: "The Fed, the Bank of England, and Japan are very supportive of these technologies because they���ll improve payment systems." He praised Ripple for working with regulators and observed that a Blockchain-based system might have prevented hackers from robbing $80 mln from the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Ben Bernanke's views on Bitcoin have changed over the years. In 2013, during a Senate Committee hearing, he called virtual currencies 'innovative payment systems' and said that the Fed had no plan to regulate them. In 2015, he said that Bitcoin's volatility and anonymous nature were serious problems. The market however, seems to be ignoring Bernanke and Dimon's views on Bitcoin and pushing it to scale ever higher peaks.	0
Elon Musk has reportedly lost $20 billion since his May 8 appearance on Saturday Night Live, as the news of Tesla halting Bitcoin payments for cars continues to send shockwaves across markets.  On May 7, the day before Musk made his appearance on SNL, Tesla stock was sitting at $669. In the week since, the stock has declined 14% to sit around $573. According to Forbes estimates, this sudden drop has seen Musk���s $166-billion net worth plunge by $20 billion down to around $145.5 billion. The 14% drop this week adds to an overall downward trend for Tesla stock over the past 30 days. On April 14, TSLA shares were sitting at $784. Friday���s price of $573 marks a 26.91% decrease over this period, according to data from TradingView.  Musk���s escapades aren���t just causing volatility in Tesla stock prices of course, with Bitcoin���s (BTC) price declining 8.1% from $54,448 when he dropped his BTC payments bombshell on Thursday down to around $50,000 currently, according to CoinGecko. Alex Mashinsky, CEO of digital asset lender Celcius Network, said the crypto industry didn���t need friends like Musk, telling Yahoo Finance that: He noted that Tesla made a $300-million profit from selling a portion of its Bitcoin, which dramatically improved its Q1 bottom line. ���So, obviously, they use Bitcoin to deliver a very important quarter for them,��� he said. ���So, you can���t have it both ways. You can���t say Bitcoin���s not good for me. So, Bitcoin doesn���t need Tesla.��� MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor also came out firing, taking on Musk on Twitter about the billionaire���s claims Bitcoin is not environmentally friendly. The estimated electricity consumption per https://t.co/Lj4SMIkLS8 YTD increased 40% during the same period that the network grew 100% in assets, meaning that energy efficiency dramatically improved during this time period. #Bitcoin is becoming less energy intensive as it scales. Musk posted links to articles that referenced ���dirty coal��� Bitcoin mining operations, such as the plant in Xinjiang that temporarily shut down for safety checks last month, which resulted in a sharp drop in the hash rate of China���s top mining pools. The links also point to the controversial expansion of Greenbridge���s gas-fired Bitcoin plant in New York.  Saylor fired back by arguing the cost of Bitcoin was worth it for the benefits: Saylor might be more upset than most as he was reportedly instrumental in convincing Musk to add $1.5 billion of BTC to Tesla���s balance sheet in the first place.  MicroStrategy took advantage of the dip caused by Musk���s announcement on Thursday by spending another $15 million to buy 271 BTC, taking its total haul to 91,850 BTC.  MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 271 bitcoins for $15.0 million in cash at an average price of ~$55,387 per #bitcoin. As of 5/13/2021, we #hodl ~91,850 bitcoins acquired for ~$2.241 billion at an average price of ~24,403 per bitcoin. $MSTRhttps://t.co/EwZnRkAt6k Not everyone saw Musk���s actions in a negative light. Anthony Scaramucci, CEO of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, suggested that this was part of Musk���s plan to help clean up Bitcoin mining by encouraging it to move to 100% renewables. He wagered 500,000 Satoshis that Musk would enter the ���super clean��� Bitcoin mining market.  Elon is not a half measures guy. I predict he will become a competitor/disruptor in the Bitcoin mining industry. I wager 500k sats that, within a year, Tesla/Solar City will announces its entry into ���super clean��� bitcoin mining.	0
���Hedge funds with crypto exposure "exploding," tweets economist and investor Tuur Demeester. According to his quoting a related article, over 70 such funds are now being in the pipeline. The linked article includes a comment by Arthur Bell manager Corey McLaughlin who says:  ���I���ve been in the hedge fund space since 1998, and I���ve never seen anything like it in volume of launches in a particular area. It���s just crazy.��� The market will likely continue to call for increasing numbers as the funds continue to outperform other market spaces. Hedge funds are always in the market for the best, brightest and fastest ways to make money, regardless of the field. The market for hedge funds is constantly shifting, as investment vehicles change direction and move with the financial times. Recent increases in the prices of cryptocurrencies have led to attention being focused on the hedge funds that had crypto holdings. Such funds were relative outliers until the market for Bitcoin and others began booming earlier this year. With the massive rise in values, hedge fund managers are seeing the need for new funds that link to cryptocurrencies and the public is calling for such funds. A recent revealed the number of such new funds, totaling nearly 70.	1
More people are searching for the word ���Ethereum��� now than ever before in its history.  Google Trends data reveals that the number of Google searches currently being performed for ���Ethereum��� is at an all-time high, eclipsing search interest during the height of the last Ether (ETH) bull run.  Ethereum���s previous peak in search term popularity was on Jan. 13, 2018 ��� the date of ETH���s all-time high of $1,432.88. Google Trends Worldwide Search Interest for #Ethereum projected to reach an all-time high: pic.twitter.com/oisOk9HhoD Historically considered a ���folk metric,��� a rising Google Trends interest score for a crypto search term is associated with positive sentiment for that particular coin/project. While it makes sense that search interest on Ethereum would peak during the run-up to a new all-time high, the same can���t be said for searches of ���Bitcoin,��� which remain at just 65% of its peak popularity on Dec. 23, 2017.  That said, many more people are searching for ���Bitcoin��� rather than ���Ethereum��� by a ratio of approximately five to one. An increase in popularity for various crypto search terms could potentially spawn a self-perpetuating bull run as curious investors make purchases, fueling the price upward and thus sparking more interest, resulting a greater number of searches. Using Google Trends data it looks like the Ethereum price lags the searches by one week.We could see the Ethereum price hit a new ATH between the 10th - 16th January. pic.twitter.com/WBmWgevZ3r Google Trends also provides data corresponding to relative interest by region. Currently, the nations with the highest interest in ���Ethereum��� as a search term are Kosovo, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Nigeria and China. Here are some cryptocurrency-related keywords along with their current interest expressed as a percentage of peak interest, which for most terms was in December 2017 or January 2018: Most of the terms above have been increasing in search frequency over the last few weeks.	2
Maybe you haven���t noticed it, but I know I have. My Bitcoin wallet has recently taken longer and longer to receive a Bitcoin payment, have advised me of a delay, and sometimes even told me why I am still waiting. This wasn���t happening 2-3 months ago, but the issue of Blockchain delays for transactions has been happening off-and-on all year long. It is a two part problem, from what I can gather, so let���s review the main factors and potential solutions. In the summer of 2015, the block size debate was all the rage, as the Bitcoin protocol showed signs of transaction fatigue for the first time. Some major corporations wanted to spike the block size to as high as 8 MB to ease the flow of Blockchain transaction traffic. In the end, the community punted and kicked the block size can down the road. More efficient applications like the upcoming Segregated Witness are coming before year���s end, increasing the effective size by as much as 70%, and The Lightning Network should appear not too far after. If there were a bunch of empty blocks, and the world wasn���t clamoring to use Bitcoin, if Bitcoin was indeed ���dead,��� as the mainstream media likes to brand it, then there would be no problem. Alas, Bitcoin is just as popular as ever, but the total transactions per day has levelled off, most probably because of the current 1 MB limitations. There seem to be more transactions than overall space, so the block size is factor number one, but as I just mentioned, help is on the way. My wallet has told me that the fees paid to miners for transactions are causing delays, so 21.co looked at the other factor. Here is what they found:  In the above chart, which can be seen in real-time here, you will see a large orange bar at the top representing the ���mempool��� for the Blockchain. This denotes the number of transactions in the mempool over the last 72 hours, having endured some sort of delay in processing. The indicators on the right side show how long a transaction takes, in blocks or minutes, and these delayed transactions all have something in common. The fees paid were only 10 Satoshis or less. These transactions have been shown to be delayed as long as 20 blocks, or up to four hours. For those who paid more than 10 Satoshis to process a transaction, as you move down the chart, mempool transactions and delays become a distant memory. When fees exceed 50 Satoshis, transactions delays of any kind become almost impossible to see, and these transactions get VIP service. So, if you want faster transactions, contact your exchange or wallet provider���s support staff to see if you can manually adjust the miner fee paid for a transaction you may need in a timely fashion. I know I have waited for 2-3 hours myself for a transaction over the last month, and this seems like it can be avoided, but you will have to be proactive, and not all wallet providers give you this flexibility. Presumably, once Segregated Witness and Lightning arrive, 2017 will see a much better flow of Bitcoin, and the current logjam show all just be a memory of being an ���early adopter,��� living on the cutting edge of 21st-century financial technology. You can tell your grandkids; ���Back in my day, we had to wait three hours for our Bitcoin!���	0
Bitcoin price claimed another all-time high on Friday, this time against gold, offering further confirmation that demand for digital assets is on the rise.  As Bitcoin (BTC) zipped past $29,000 on Friday, the digital currency reached a high of 15.40 gold ounces, surpassing the previous peak from December 2017, according to MarketWatch data.  According to U.Today, the Bitcoin-gold rate peaked at 15.62 ounces during the early morning.  2020 was a watershed year for Bitcoin as institutional adoption helped catalyze a bull market unlike any we���ve seen thus far in its 11-year history. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin saw a massive increase of around 300% in 2020.  Gold also posted impressive gains for the year, though they paled in comparison to Bitcoin���s meteoric rise. The yellow metal���s spot price ended the year on a 25% gain.  Bitcoin���s biggest proponents believe the digital currency is eating away at gold���s market cap as investors opt for the efficiency, portability and proven scarcity of the asset. Astonishingly, that view is also shared by JPMorgan Chase analysts, who believe Bitcoin���s digital gold narrative is drawing capital away from precious metals.  Some believe that Bitcoin���s supply squeeze could send prices higher over the course of 2021. As Cointelegraph recently reported, digital asset manager Grayscale bought up nearly three times the BTC mined in December. Demand from PayPal, Cash App and others has also contributed to an apparent supply shortage of BTC.	1
Dubbed as the ���Chinese Ethereum,��� NEO could possibly benefit over the long term with Chinese regulatory rules on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The Chinese government���s regulations on ICOs stem from public outrage over the large number of pyramid schemes in the country. China is set to decide on the proposed ICO regulatory measures this September following public consultations. The regulations will focus on various fundraising activities in China, including Initial Coin Offerings. If these proposed regulations are made into law, they will likely help boost NEO since the regulated ICO market will give investors confidence. That proposition was stipulated in a Reddit article by bentylerlive. Since NEO originated in China and already abides by the proposed rules, NEO would be associated with quality and functionality. China���s first public Blockchain could become China���s premier digital platform. This sentiment was echoed by one commenter who opined that regulations are inevitable and will cause a dip across all Blockchain-based assets. The end result, he believes, will be a stronger and more sustainable market. Another Reddit user said the move will surely solidify investors��� trust and ultimately lead to better organized and more transparent projects. The statement posted on Reddit reads in part: ���First off, to all the people who think China will ban ICO's: That's simply not going to happen. It would make a lot of very rich people angry in China. Let me explain.Having specific rules in place gives the market a sense of permanency and legitimacy. It reassures many investors in China that the Chinese government is watching very closely for cases of fraud, and will react in order to[sic] protect the public. That's bullish for NEO. Incoming regulations were inevitable. Even if they weren't, we still don't want a series of low quality ICO's clogging up the NEO platform. NEO should be associated with quality and functionality, first and foremost. Like all of you, I look forward to NEO becoming the premier digital platform led by the fine folks in China, and now we are one step closer to that goal.��� It is apparent that soon ICOs will need more than just marketing blitz--they���ll need to be compliant.	2
New research by cybersecurity firm, Cyble Research Team, revealed that on May 29, data for more than 80,000 credit cards were put up for sale on the dark web. The data from these cards appears to have been gathered from various countries around the world. According to the announcement, the data leak involved credit card details from various countries, such as the United States (33K), France (14K), Australia (5K), United Kingdom (5K), Canada (2K), Singapore (1.2 K) and India (1.3K). They include both Visa and Mastercard, according to the information collected by Cyble. The price of each credit card, which includes the name of the cardholder, CVV code, and expiration date, is $5 per unit, paid in crypto. This price is regardless of each card���s value. According to the research, the country classification was unveiled due to the leak of billing information. This info included each card holder���s address, making it easier for the cybersecurity company to establish the country origins of each card. It is not clear where the hackers stole the data from, but Cyble believes that it could have come from a phishing website or an online store that the hackers had managed to breach. Cyble created a search engine so people could check whether their personal information was leaked on the dark web. In total, their database contains over 40 billion records. The study comes after the cybersecurity firm identified and reported another massive data breach, which involved over 47.5 million Indian Truecaller records for sale on the dark web for only $ 1,000.  Cointelegraph reported on May 15 that anonymous hackers had taken the data of over 129 million Russian car owners and exposed it on the darknet in exchange for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC). A group of hackers also breached the Ethereum.org forum and allegedly put the database for the three most-popular crypto hard wallets up for sale.	0
The founder and CEO of Avanti Financial is claiming Tether���s recent disclosure about the stablecoin's reserves may have contributed to the altcoin selloffs last week. In a series of Saturday tweets, Caitlin Long said that Tether Holdings Limited���s breakdown of Tether���s (USDT) reserves were not invested in ���short-term, lower-risk, liquid securities,��� but rather credit assets of ���who-knows-what quality.��� The Avanti CEO claimed traders may have felt compelled to sell other cryptocurrencies to reduce their total risk exposure, given that the stablecoin ��� ranked sixth with a $58 billion market cap ��� has the potential to bring down other tokens amid a credit market correction. ���If Tether stays a de facto credit hedge fund by investing reserves this way, markets now can safely predict that Bitcoin and crypto prices will likely exhibit high correlation with credit markets,��� said Long. ���They will probably correct together.��� Long added that authorities may still choose to crack down on stablecoins following Tether���s full reserve breakdown, but said the crypto industry could benefit from regulatory clarity: According to the Tether Holdings Limited report, 75.85% of USDT backing is formed by cash and equivalents, with commercial paper accounting for 65.39% of this category. Long claimed any potential fallout in markets ���will have been entirely avoidable��� if Tether had invested more in Treasury Bills ��� only 2.94% out of its total cash, cash equivalents, other short-term deposits and commercial paper ��� rather than assets with seemingly higher risk. The CEO���s comments come following the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $46,000 on some exchanges ��� the crypto asset is $45,818 at the time of publication, having fallen more than 20% in the last seven days. However, it���s unclear what role Tether���s disclosure may have played in the crypto market. Binance was also in the spotlight as a Bloomberg report claimed that the U.S. Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service were investigating the crypto exchange for alleged ���illicit activity.���	1
Ethereum network is nearing the merger phase of its crucial transition from proof-of-work (PoW) mining consensus to proof-of-stake (PoS). Ethereum (ETH) devs offered a perpetual merger date during a conference call on Thursday. The conference call saw core Ethereum developer Tim Beiko, who runs core protocol meetings, propose September 19 as the tentative target date for the merger. The proposed target date didn���t face any objection from the core developers. Later, Ethereum developer superphiz.eth tweeted about the roadmap to the merger and also cleared that the proposed target date should be seen as a roadmap rather than a hard deadline. This merge timeline isn't final, but it's extremely exciting to see it coming together. Please regard this as a planning timeline and look out for official announcements!https://t.co/ttutBceZ21 pic.twitter.com/MY8VFOv0SI Ethereum���s transition journey to PoS-based ETH 2.0 began on December 1, 2020, with the launch of Beacon Chain, initiating Phase 0 of the transition. Phase 1 of the program was scheduled to launch in mid-2021 but got delayed to the first quarter of 2022 owing to unfinished work and the complexities involved in the code auditing.  Earlier in June this year, Sepolia testnet Beacon Chain went live, setting the stage for its Merge dress rehearsal to give Ethereum network developers valuable technical insights. The Sepolia was eventually merged with the network on July 7.  The final trial of the Merge is set to occur on the Goerli network, which is scheduled for the second week of August. After its merger, the official Merge slated for the second half of September would become a priority for devs. Ethereum���s transition to PoS based network is expected to reduce its energy consumption by 99% and the introduction of sharding (expected by the first quarter of 2023) would make the network highly scalable and on par with centralized payment processors. The PoS vs. PoW debate has been a long-running one, where PoS proponents claim it's more environment friendly and equally secure while PoW proponents, including the likes of Jack Dorsey, have called PoS centralized and less secure.  Lately, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been aggressively defending PoS, arguing that quite opposite to common belief, PoS does not include voting on protocol parameters, just like proof-of-work (PoW) doesn���t. Buterin also explained that nodes reject invalid blocks in both PoS and PoW. Pro-tip: if there's a long-established tradition of people debating A vs B based on deep arguments touching on math, economics and moral philosophy, and you come along saying "B is dumb because of a one-line technicality involving definitions", you're probably wrong. https://t.co/22N0OaHyz1 While Buterin continues to bat for PoS, a recent report from HOPR highlighted some of the key vulnerabilities that could prove critical post Merge. The report highlighted that validators on the network leak their IP addresses while broadcasting attestations and blocks, which are linked to their public key but these validators are known ahead of time, allowing for highly targeted and selective attacks (DoS or other) against upcoming validators.  The @Teku_ConsenSys audit by @Quantstamp even labels the issue as ���Mitigated��� which in our eyes is incorrect and makes us double down on our efforts to raise awareness for this privacy and resulting security issue 5/15 The HOPR team noted that an audit report has even labeled the issue as ���mitigated,��� which is not true because attackers are not limited to (DoS) attacking the Teku node.	1
Lloyds Banking Group, the largest bank in the UK, has become the first major credit card provider in the country to ban its customers from using credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, the Daily Telegraph reported today, Feb. 5. Their ban follows directly on the heels of J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup���s identical decision yesterday to ban credit cards purchases of cryptocurrencies for their customers. Lloyds, which contain Halifax, Bank of Scotland, and MBNA, will block its 9 million credit card customers from making crypto purchases through an online blacklist that will flag sellers. Lloyd���s customers will still be able to buy cryptocurrencies with their debit cards. The credit card block was instituted after Bitcoin (BTC) saw a large price drop in the market this week, falling below $8000 for several days in a row. Lloyds has said that this ban will ���protect customers��� that could accumulate large amounts of credit card debt if the market price keeps falling. Bitcoin is trading around $7,451 by press time, down about 14 percent over a 24-hour period.	0
There are a number of threats to any asset, be it gold, fiat currency or even stocks. Some of these have real-world issues, such as loss, theft or destruction, and Bitcoin is not separate from that. There is more than enough literature on the theft of Bitcoin, people leaving themselves exposed to cyber criminals, but there are also instances where people are losing their coins. Just like Gold can be sunk with a pirate ship, or wads of dollar bills burned in a fire, digital currencies can also be lost and never found again on the Blockchain. New research by Chainanalysis, a digital forensics firm that studies the Bitcoin Blockchain, showed that 3.79 mln Bitcoins are already lost. This is on the high estimate of the study's finding, with their low estimate still sitting at an astonishing 2.78 mln. This makes the percentage of lost coins based on what has been mined today to be at between 17 to 23 percent.  According to a breakdown supplied by Chainanalysis, their research seems to be quite thorough and a little more than just speculation. In their segmentation of coins that have been lost in different ways, they have broken it down into coins mined in 2017 - which they believe are still all intact and available. It makes sense that there would be more caution in 2017 with the value of fractions of coins worth huge amounts. When they refer to strategic investments, they are looking at people who have been holding their coins for a very long time, and thus are perhaps not lost, rather just growing in a stagnant position. Interestingly, and in a big claim by Chainanalysis, they take into consideration the coins that originally belonged to Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. He is estimated to be in the possession of over one mln coins. However, Chainanalysis have decided to class that collection of coins as lost forever. It is a claim on which their research hinges on as Nakamoto's coins make up nearly half of their higher estimate of lost coins. Should, one day, Nakamoto wake like a sleeping giant and bring his coins back into play, this research will be inconsequential and the market will have to front up to a rather large boom in supply. Because Bitcoin operates on a promise of a limited supply, missing coins, especially verging on 25 percent, will clearly be playing a big part in determining the market. Supply and demand will be quite skewed if those coins mined are not reflecting on the market. However, do these missing coins really mean that Bitcoin is more scarce than people assume? ���That is a very complex question. On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity,��� said Kim Grauer, Senior Economist at Chainalysis. ���Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available ��� just look at exchange behavior. Furthermore, it is well known monetary policy procedure to lower or increase fiat reserves to impact exchange rates. So the answer is yes and no.���	0
Bitcoin (BTC) has retaken $10,000 today on July 18 following a moderately volatile month, according to data provided by Coin360.  Bitcoin starting its parabolic advance in April 2019 which culminated in retaking the 5-figure mark in June for the first time since March 2018. At the time, BTC was on a slow-and-steady bull run that peaked just shy of $14,000 on June 26. Since then, BTC has moved around a decent amount, dipping below $10,000 on July 2, retaking $13,000 on July 10, and slumping below $10,000 again on July 16. Some analysts linked this week���s correction to technical reasons alongside the Libra hearings on Capitol Hill. Additionally, recent remarks from United States Secretary Treasury Steven Mnuchin who echoed president Donald Trump���s ���not a fan of Bitcoin��� comments could have also played a role.  But the ongoing scrutiny of Facebook���s Libra project in Washington D.C. appears to be educating lawmakers about the key differences between Bitcoin and other so-called ���cryptocurrencies.��� As reported by Cointelegraph, Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow suggested that Facebook should have simply offered a BTC service instead of foraying into a new cryptocurrency with Libra. Mow remarked: ���Once Libra is compliant with every jurisdiction, it will just be a more complex PayPal governed by an association. Should've just used Bitcoin.��� Meanwhile, U.S. representative Patrick McHenry said that he believes Bitcoin (BTC) can not be killed in an interview with CNBC���s Squawk Box on July 17. During the interview ��� when he was asked whether he believes politicians will allow cryptocurrencies to thrive ��� McHenry said: ���I think there���s no capacity to kill Bitcoin. Even the Chinese, with their firewall and their extreme intervention in their society could not kill Bitcoin.��� McHenry also pointed out that newer cryptocurrencies, backed by startups or corporations, are trying to replicate the success of Bitcoin���s decentralized, open-access network. He concluded: ���The essence of Bitcoin is what Libra and Facebook, and corporates are trying to mimic.��� As Cointelegraph reported, the United States��� Senate Banking Committee raised a wave skepticism over Facebook���s crypto project Libra during the first day of testimony on July 16.	2
Today, we continue to share our findings from BlockShow Asia 2017 being held in Singapore and here is one more expert interview coming. This time we talked to Owen Tao, CEO of Matrix, a Blockchain company that is aiming to take Blockchain and smart contract to non-technical people using AI. You are welcome to read the interview and travel through the expert mindings by yourself: Cointelegraph: What brought you to launch Matrix? Owen Tao: I'm a big fan of Blockchain and I have been following this industry for years. But the smart contract can only serve you if you know how to program; otherwise, you can���t use the smart contract. That this is the reason why Matrix uses AI technology - if you only just need to write down what you want or what you need in natural language -  it is the machines who will do the coding - that is, to run the smart contract for you. That's what we want. We want to create a smarter contract as much a Blockchain to serve anyone. CT: How do you think: this technology and AI together will actually help us? Could it push the boundaries of what we think is possible? OT: We hope that through Blockchain, the power of the smart contract could be accessible to every person and the inefficiencies at larger scale could be eliminated. These days, the most criticized part of mining is the waste of energy. In the future, more electricity will be wasted on mining the cryptocurrencies. So that���s the power going waste, which can actually be used for other opportunities such as sensitive computing and soft analysis. In a nutshell, we want the mining process generally to have universal values -  it is pretty much our dream for the future. CT: Your background is more in business. Do you think that smart contracts will really change the way that business is done? OT: In fact, it won���t change the rules one bit. The most important thing for Matrix is that we want to increase the number of people using Blockchain and smart contract. So one day we will have millions using these technologies all around the world and anyone could also use our product. That���s probably billions of users. So maybe we won���t change the business per se, but change the world of business. CT: And in what industry, do you think, this technology will help the most? Which industry needs smart contracts and Blockchain more than anyone else? OT: That���s actually a hard question. I���d say virtually any industry would require a service like this. For instance, in the future, maybe you���ll be able to put all the things on the network - you can make the machines do the work for you or you could even schedule the work for particular timings. Say, you are working till late at the office but you don���t know when you will leave work. You could use the smart contract to leave the company before 7 p.m. This way your phone will call the restaurant and maybe book the seats for you and your girlfriend. If you leave work after 7, then maybe your phone will cover hotels: just put a room for you. CT: That sounds very interesting! The future is gonna be different. One last question about the conference as a whole. Have you found out about something you didn't know before and that you might want to implement into your business ventures in the future? OT: Actually, this is my first time attending such a conference since BlockShow is the most attended Blockchain conference in the world. So this one is quite different for me. I really enjoyed the whole conference because of such wonderful speakers and I think I���ve learned a lot by talking to people from different backgrounds. I met people from all over the world. Our project, Matrix, needs to do something along the same lines -- connect everyone through Blockchain regardless our nationalities and language. We believe that cryptocurrencies will be the digital of the future. So I���m really glad I attended this conference. CT: Thank you!	1
Nobel Prize laureate for economics Robert Shiller believes that while Bitcoin (BTC) might be a bubble, that doesn���t mean that it will burst and be gone forever, according to an interview on April 13 with CNBC���s Trading Nation. Shiller, who is currently a professor of economics at Yale University, referred to BTC as ���another example of faddish human behavior. It���s glamorous���: "I'm interested in [B]itcoin as a sort of bubble. It doesn't mean that it will disappear, that it'll burst forever. It may be with us for a while." Shiller highlights that he knows that ���smart people��� have invested in cryptocurrencies, including many of his students, but adds that the attraction to crypto is ���a story that I think goes way beyond the merit of the idea. It is more psychological than something that could be explained by the computer science department." According to Shiller, there is a ���part��� of the cryptocurrency ���fad��� or ���bubble��� that is political, as people that don���t trust their governments may be tempted to invest. In September of last year, Shiller went on CNBC���s Fast Money with Brian Kelly to speak along the same lines about crypto, saying that ���it���s the quality of the story that���s attracting all this interest.��� On Friday, April 13 Brian Kelly said in an interview that he supports investor Tim Draper���s prediction that Bitcoin���s price could hit $250,000 by 2022.	1
Bybt data apparently showing a massive liquidation of XRP and Stellar Lumen (XLM) by Grayscale Investments earlier this week is inaccurate, according to the investment company. On Wednesday, a public Bybt data set suggested that Grayscale Investments reduced its exposure to XRP by roughly 9.19 million units and that the fund also cut its XLM holdings by over 9.74 million units. According to Bybt data, the net change in holdings occurred over 24 hours on Tuesday. Cointelegraph accessed the data before Grayscale released its daily assets under management report for Tuesday and noted in an article that Grayscale had reportedly sold significant amounts of XRP and XLM. Efforts to reach Grayscale on Wednesday were unsuccessful. However, on Thursday, a Grayscale spokesperson told Cointelegraph:  Bybt���s data feed still shows a large outflow of XRP and XLM from Grayscale over the past seven days, both in terms of AUM and actual units of XRP and XLM held. These figures appeared under the ���24H Change��� column on Wednesday.  The Grayscale AUM report for Wednesday was released on Thursday. It reads: In a response to Cointelegraph, Bybit indicated that there was a "delay in tracking the positions of these currencies," referring specifically to XRP, XLM, Zcash and Horizon.	1
Reddit has reportedly removed the option for users to pay for their premium membership program, Reddit Gold, in Bitcoin (BTC) citing an ���upcoming Coinbase change���, according to a Reddit post in subreddit /r/btc published March 23. Reddit user BitcoinXio posted a video of the steps to give another user Reddit Gold, showing that the only payment options are PayPal and credit card.  Reddit user emoney40, a moderator of several subreddits but not /r/btc, commented that the change is due to the Coinbase Commerce change: ���The upcoming Coinbase change, combined with some bugs around the Bitcoin payment option that were affecting purchases for certain users, led us to remove Bitcoin as a payment option.��� Coinbase posted on its Medium page in early March 2018 about retiring Coinbase Merchant Tools in place of Coinbase Commerce, which they acknowledged ���may be disruptive to Coinbase Merchant Tool customers.��� As of April 30, merchants that used Coinbase Merchant Tools will no longer have access to that product, with May 31 as the final date for the required switch to Coinbase Commerce. User emoney40 also said that adding BTC back as a payment option is not a guarantee: ���We're going to take a look at demand and watch the progression of Coinbase Commerce before making a decision on whether to reenable.��� Some Reddit users on the thread commented that they were not using BTC to pay for Reddit Gold anyway, due to the high transaction fees. However, in February BTC transaction fees dipped below the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fees, which had been one of the main talking points of BTC���s competitors.	0
As early as 04:30 GMT+2 on Sunday, up to top 34 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap were all in pimento red, bleeding profusely as if there had been a knife battle between some savages. Only 12 cryptos out of the top 100 could boast of gains. In the top 10, blood was gushing out of the nose of market leader Bitcoin with a negative 6.17 percent bashing bringing the price to $2,579.65. Ether's market price, which was worth over $350 on Saturday afternoon, has now crashed to $319. The big players have all been subdued by slumps and the market is a mere shadow of itself. Though losses do not appear to be hefty like previous downturns, there are strong indications of a bad omen. The biggest losers in the top 10 were newcomer IOTA, who experienced a 12.11 percent fall, followed by Blockchain application token Stratis, with a negative 12.5 percentage points. The least decay was recorded by SegWit pioneer Litecoin, which was not even tiny - 5.67 percent.  There is no moment of inspiration with so many losses everywhere. But the point is we have always recovered from such bleak moments to reach higher heights again. There have been worse scenarios than this situation where our detractors predicted it was over for us, yet we bounced back big time. However, at number 35, Numeraire was prospering in the midst of all the darkness and doom. It soared an unimaginable 176.67 percent to sell at $147.76. This brings to mind the previous depression experienced a fortnight and almost a month ago, which Cointelegraph christened the "crypto massacre." If we are in a market panic, then this is the third in barely a month. In late May, markets witnessed a roller-coaster that nearly sent everyone running for shelter. However, there was nowhere to run to, as almost every solid coin was in the red. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and NEM lost more than 24, 31, 39 and 40 percent respectively. Two weeks later, in the middle of June, there was another recession which was not child's play either. This time around, the top four saw a decline between 13-17 percent. Three bubbles in a month leave much to be desired. Is this another crypto massacre? We will live and see.	0
According to Bitcoin.com co-founder and CTO Emil Oldenburg, Bitcoin is ���useless��� and has no future as a tradeable currency, citing high transaction fees and long lead times. In an interview with Swedish tech site Breakit, Oldenburg said that he had sold all of his Bitcoin and switched to Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork of Bitcoin created in August 2017. Oldenburg justifies his actions, saying: ���An investment in Bitcoin right now I would say is the most risky investment one can make. It is extremely high-risk. I���ve actually sold all of my Bitcoins recently and switched to Bitcoin Cash.��� Despite the fact that Oldenburg���s company is in fact a Bitcoin wallet, the CTO says that he has become disenchanted with Bitcoin due to its high transaction fees and slow confirmation time, saying Bitcoin���s current performance is ���completely unreasonable.��� Increased transaction speed and lower costs are the main features supporters of Bitcoin Cash point to when comparing the two coins. Based on analysis, Bitcoin transaction fees have indeed increased from an average of 20 cents to about $15 over the course of 2017. Addressing the apparent conflict of interest between his company and his personal views, Oldenburg explained that the wallet is also moving away from Bitcoin to focus on Bitcoin Cash: ���We���ve actually stopped developing new services for the old Bitcoin network now and are focusing mostly on [developing for] Bitcoin Cash. Where it costs only 10 ��re [$0.12] to send [BCH] and there���s no waiting. The only backside is that it requires larger hard drives, but that���s not a problem for most people.��� Oldenburg further argued that the problems with Bitcoin transactions emerge during the recording of the transactions on the Blockchain. He claimed that the bottleneck on the Blockchain results in a highly risky and illiquid digital currency: ���There's only a limited amount of transactions per second you can make in the Bitcoin network, which in part depends on the ���block size��� of the memory that store the transactions on the Blockchain. This bottleneck makes for a highly risky and illiquid cryptocurrency���the old Bitcoin network is as good as unusable.��� The price of Bitcoin, however, continues to grow and has already breached the $20,000 level this week. It is currently trading at around $18,000 as of press time.	0
It may not have had the most growth in 2017, but Ethereum has regained its place behind Bitcoin as the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Not to be outdone by Bitcoin���s 1,000 percent rise in value in 2017, Ethereum also moved from $10 per Ether to $1,000 in the space of 12 months. The two cryptocurrencies enjoyed similar success, but their underlying Blockchain technology is contrastingly different. Ethereum���s flagship smart contract system sets it apart from Bitcoin and has led to it becoming the leading platform for ICOs, allowing developers to use the underlying code for their own applications - commonly known as decentralized applications (dapp). This is in essence Ethereum���s raison d�����tre, providing a monetized Blockchain solution for developers to create applications as described by Investopedia. Speaking to CNBC this week, Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff says the open-source functionality of Ethereum���s protocol could well lead to mass adoption for a wide variety of Blockchain applications. "You're seeing a tremendous amount of growth across a wide variety of industries. Fintech is actually the natural area, but now you're seeing it becoming increasingly more creative ��� you find projects in the oil and gas industry, you're finding government using it in their applications, you're seeing it in gaming, all kinds of different areas.��� The success of CryptoKitties is a prime example of how developers can use the Ethereum software to create innovative applications. The popular online game was so successful that it placed a massive strain on the Ethereum network in 2017 as it became the biggest dapp. Inevitably, the increasing use of Ethereum will see it���s price soar, according to Nerayoff. ���What you're seeing with Ethereum is an exponential increase in the number of projects. There are billions of dollars being poured into the ecosystem right now, maybe 10 times more projects this year than last year, which could easily lead to a doubling, probably a tripling in price by the end of the year.��� While Nerayoff expressed bullish sentiments towards Ethereum���s growth this year, he didn���t write off the potential growth of other cryptocurrencies this year. "The entire space is increasing. There is huge interest by the public and there are more areas in which the public can invest, even in Bitcoin, so you could just see an expansion in the entire space," At the time of writing, Ethereum���s total market cap was sitting at $116 bln.	2
The United Nations World Food Programme uses the Ethereum Blockchain to transfer vouchers based on cryptocurrencies to refugees in Syria. The platform was able to transfer cryptocurrency vouchers to a total of 10,000 people. It was done through another platform that was created by Parity Technologies. Parity Technologies is a startup company led by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. "Funds that were sent to the refugees were specifically used for buying food. With the success of this project, the World Food Programme (WFP) plans to extend the project even further to cover 100,000 people in Jordan by late 2018." With this, the UN is planning more Blockchain technology-related projects that can help them move aid to disaster-stricken countries even faster. The projects planned by the UN show that the Blockchain technology has the potential to really impact the entire world making the flow of transactions more efficient and secure. In fact, a report by Oracle reveals that various industries will definitely be impacted by the innovative Blockchain technology. Some of the industries that are expected to be affected positively by Blockchain technology would be the healthcare industry, energy sector and, most notably, governments. With regards to governments, the flow of currency transactions can be made more efficient and also safer at the same time, which could lessen the presence of discrepancies in the funds. With the use of Blockchain technology being heavily considered by many institutions and business as of present, the world can definitely expect to see more industries and sectors making use of Blockchain technology.	2
Goldman Sachs has said Bitcoin ���is not a fraud��� as it unveiled plans to buy and sell cryptocurrency, the New York Times reported May 2. In a move which sets the investment banking giant apart from its Wall Street competitors, Goldman will initially offer various contracts with Bitcoin exposure before rumoredly entering the trading arena. Commenting on the decision, Rana Yared, an executive involved in creating the offerings, said the bank had been ���inundated��� with client requests. ���It resonates with us when a client says, ���I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,������ she told the publication. ���...It is not a new risk that we don���t understand. It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.��� She added that Goldman ���had concluded Bitcoin is not a fraud,��� a poignant statement in an industry where competitor JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon���s infamous description of Bitcoin still resonates. Nonetheless, even Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein publicly stated Bitcoin ���is not for him��� during its all-time price highs in December 2017, and Yared appeared quick to dispel any myths that the bank was a ���Bitcoin believer.��� ���I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world,��� she added. ���For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.���	2
Ethereum classic is making a strong statement. The decentralized smart contract platform is on flame hitting more than $1.3 bln market cap on Wednesday morning. In fact, it streaked as high as more than 55 percent to sell at $16.11. ETC's new growth trend is amazing and enthralling. Cointelegraph spoke to JuicyG of Coinchat.Club, who revealed some magnetic bearings.  He says: "I've been bullish on ETC for the past few months, I think it will outperform most coins out there." The Crypto adds: "I think the major move up hasn't happened yet. It will happen once Barry and his friends will start promoting it on Bloomberg and CNBC."  JuicyG maintains ETC could become the second most talked about cryptocurrency aside from Bitcoin and going to see an unprecedented growth supported by massive investment. "All the big money guys will start buying ETC," he articulates. Indeed every network relies on its membership expansion to grow and JuicyG did not mince words on how crucial that is going to be for fast growing ETC. The man who is the brain behind the Dash Force Proposal was also upbeat about Ethereum's younger brother's technical team. Actually, he believes they are one of the best around. "Ethereum Classic devs are not amateurs or total amateurs like some of these other projects," he asserts. This he believes is also another determinant propelling the Smart Contract Crypto to higher lengths. The ongoing Consensus 2017 where Barry Silbert is one of the organizers, is being attended by the many movers and shakers in both the cryptocurrency industry and the business arena in New York. JuicyG thinks considering the fact that Silbert owns a chunk of ETC, he has every interest to push it at the event. "Sure, he has the biggest incentive to promote ETC first and foremost," JuicyG said. He explained further that, that is the more reason why Silbert created an ETC investment fund, second only after Bitcoin.  More engrossingly, JuicyG's opinion is that Ethereum Classic is even undervalued taking into account the massive capital infusion. He refers to the current Market cap as peanut to what ETC is really is. "At the current market cap, they're probably at less than 10 percent the market cap of Ethereum and given the massive capital influx and publicity, ETC will get I think it's massively undervalued," the Moderator of Coinchat.Club affirmed. His deepest revelation was actually this: "We will see a big exodus of projects moving from ETH to ETC. We're already seeing it." It could be recalled that on Monday Cointelegraph predicted that ETC is preparing to dislodge its elder brother Ethereum from the top.	2
The vice president of blockchain and digital currencies for IBM, Jesse Lund, said that he expects Bitcoin���s (BTC) price to eventually hit $1 million. Lund made his prediction during an interview with comparison and news platform Finder.com, published on YouTube on Feb. 20. Towards the end of the interview, Lund was asked what he expects the price of Bitcoin to be on this new year���s eve. He answered that he thinks it is going to be higher than the current price, clarifying, ���I���ll go with $5,000.��� He then continued his prediction, adding: ���I see Bitcoin at a million dollars someday.��� Lund explained that he ���likes that number,��� given that ���if Bitcoin is at a million dollars, then satoshi is on value parity with the U.S. penny.��� He noted that at such a value, the whole network would have over $20 trillion of liquidity. He then suggested that such liquidity could change corporate payments and high value payments in general, concluding: ���I see maybe $5,000 at the end of the year, but I see a way higher upward trajectory.��� During the interview, Lund also talked about IBM���s collaboration with Stellar (XLM) and the use of the network���s native asset in IBM���s cross-border payment network, Blockchain World Wire (BWW). As previously reported, IBM uses XLM in BWW both as an intermediate currency and to pay transaction fees. Lund also revealed that the firm is considering working with various other digital assets, explaining that they believe ���there should be an ecosystem of, a variety of digital assets that provide settlement instruments that enable these cross-border payments, and the participants in the network should be able to choose and negotiate their choices in real-time.��� Lund went on to state: ���it could be Ripple, it could be XRP even, it could be Bitcoin, but it would also probably include other instruments, like stablecoins, and even eventually soon ��� hopefully ��� central bank-issued digital currencies.��� Lund made a point of differentiating IBM���s payment network from Ripple���s RippleNet, noting that the tech giant does not rely on their own bespoke token. Oman���s second largest bank by market value, BankDhofar, became RippleNet���s most recent member, joining to enable cross-border payments to India, as Cointelegraph recently reported. IBM brought its BWW payment network out of beta back in September 2018, after closing a partnership with Stellar in October 2017. About a week ago, major Canadian crypto exchange Coinsquare showed interest in the blockchain by acquiring StellarX, a Stellar-based decentralized exchange.	2
The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has granted today stablecoin company and PayPal collaborator Paxos a federal charter to form a national trust bank ��� just the third such charter the OCC has granted crypto-native companies.  Paxos joins custody firm Achorage, who was the first to receive a charter in January, and fellow custodian Protego, which received their conditional charter in February.  As with the previous two charters, the ���bank��� label is somewhat misleading in that Paxos will not immediately be handling deposits. Instead, they received a ���Fintech Charter��� ��� a type of banking charter that was pioneered by former acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks.  The charter permits Paxos to conduct activities such as ���custody services for digital assets; custody and management of USD stablecoin reserves; payment, exchange, and other agent services; other cryptocurrency services, such as trading services and enabling partners to buy and sell cryptocurrency; and ���know your customer��� as a service,��� per an approval letter from the OCC sent to Paxos general counsel Dan Burstein. The letter notes that all of these activities are currently being conducted by the Paxos Trust Company operating with a New York BitLicense; the charter allows a new Paxos entity to become a federally-regulated organization.  The OCC���s letter also indicates that there was some resistance to the issuance of the charter from the traditional banking sector. During a public comment period, the OCC received a ���letter signed by a number of trade groups representing banks��� arguing that ���the proposed activities do not align with OCC precedent with respect to fiduciary activities conducted by national trust banks,��� and that ���the application does not provide sufficient information on the Bank���s business model.��� However, the OCC countered that they ���received sufficient information to make an informed decision��� and ultimately determined that ���it is appropriate to grant preliminary conditional approval to allow the organizers to proceed with the organization of the Bank.��� The approval follows a string of high-profile wins for Paxos. In December, the company raised $142 million in a funding round, and in April applied for a clearing license following a successful pilot of same-day stablecoin settlement with Credit Suisse, among other institutions.	2
Bitcoin, and the idea of digital cash, has taken hold of the banking sector as banks and financial institutions start to experiment internally with blockchains and cryptocurrencies in order to be at the forefront of these technologies. This, coupled with the fact that government organisations and even global leadership bodies such as the G20 are looking to regulate cryptocurrencies, again give more legitimacy and longevity to the industry. The latest wave of adoption is now coming from corporations who, traditionally have come to be successful thanks to their centralized domination over different aspects of the market. Microsoft, in the world of computing, are legendary in driving the world to be digital; then there is Amazon, the pioneers of e-commerce. These companies are in some manner getting forced towards blockchain technology as it has become apparent that this is the future, and even though it goes against their centralized values, they simply cannot miss out. Microsoft has always been one of the biggest companies to give Bitcoin its dues. Back in Dec. 2014, content on the Windows and Xbox stores could be bought in Bitcoin, and this was at a time where Bitcoin���s mainstream adoption and appeal was minimal. This of course was merely a nod towards alternative payment methods, and Microsoft being flexible to its customers wants and needs. However since then, and since blockchain has grown, Microsoft has been pushing to be in front of the innovative queue. Microsoft has obviously identified the power of blockchain and its far reaching potential for disruptive applications in the world of enterprise business. The company is now developing blockchain applications - which are not that flashy as some of the solutions put forward by startups, but equally practical. Microsoft is also looking to build platforms on which businesses can grow their blockchain applications upon, such as the Confidential Consortium (Coco) Framework, an Ethereum-based protocol, which falls under Microsoft Azure, the company���s cloud computing arm. They have also announced that they are looking into plans to integrate blockchain-based decentralized IDs (DIDs) into its Microsoft Authenticator app. The latest from the computing giant is that Azure has released its blockchain app creation service, Azure Blockchain Workbench, on May 7. Workbench aims to allow businesses looking to create bespoke blockchain apps to speed up the development process by automating infrastructure setup. Both Microsoft and Amazon have similar origins with their founders - Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos - being driven men with revolutionary ideas. Therefore it is unsurprising to see these two companies pushing to be on the forefront of a new technological wave. Gates may be spouting some pretty negative things about Bitcoin, and Bezos may be under siege to accept the digital currency on Amazon, but despite what the two founders think of the cryptocurrency space, it is becoming clear that the future is conquering the companies. Amazon revolutionized the e-commerce space, and is looking to at least be near to top of the pecking order when blockchain technology truly takes a hold. Just like in banking, there is a rush to get blockchain figured out and usable before the rest of the competition gets to market. Amazon are already in a battle with IBM and Oracle with its own ���blockchain-as-a-service��� offering. The blockchain framework for Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, which is allowing users to build and manage their own Blockchain-powered decentralized applications, is being developed in different forms by all three. Essentially, users would be able to create their own blockchain applications via the Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudFormation Templates tool to avoid time-consuming manual setups of their blockchain network. Oracle, the world���s second-largest software company, also recently unveiled blockchain products, and will be releasing them over the next two months. Again, it was a similar cloud service built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric project like Microsoft, and equally similar to IBM���s blockchain service, announced a year ago. Major companies are also jumping on the blockchain bandwagon in different easy, shapes and forms. Huawei is loading its phones with a built-in Bitcoin wallet;  Samsung revealed that it will use blockchain for managing its global supply chain; Spanish banking group BBVA became the first global bank to issue a loan on a blockchain, and use-cases continue to grow around the world. It was not long ago that people were calling Bitcoin a fad, a scam, and something that will not last for long. Those voices have been silenced somewhat as even banks, one of the biggest detractors of cryptocurrencies, are realising that they need to be on the forefront of this emerging technology. The excitement is spreading, and it is creating an arms race even outside banks and the finance sector. Blockchain technology, while intrinsically attached to cryptocurrencies, also has many applications for other sectors. These applications are being explored, and evaluated. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung, Huawei and others, all realize that with all these possibilities, it would be blind to not dive in, and quick. AWS vice president Jeff Barr explained in a post: ���Some of the people that I talk to see blockchains as the foundation of a new monetary system and a way to facilitate international payments. Others see blockchains as a distributed ledger and immutable data source that can be applied to logistics, supply chain, land registration, crowdfunding and other use cases,. Either way, it���s clear that there are a lot of intriguing possibilities and we are working to help our customers use this technology more effectively.��� Neil Patel, advisor to Kind Ads, a decentralized ad-network that consults companies such as Amazon and Microsoft, reiterates that these major corporations almost have no choice but to embrace blockchain technology as it is being regarded quite openly as the future of technology. Patel told Cointelegraph: "Microsoft and Amazon have no choice but to focus on blockchain because it is the future. If they don't, they know that it will hurt their growth in the cloud computing space. Just look at Facebook, they see the value in blockchain so much that they moved around their executive team to put the ex president of PayPal on blockchain projects." Patel���s example above makes mention of how David Marcus, the former president of PayPal and the Facebook executive who has been running the company���s Messenger app, is now assembling a team to explore blockchain technology for the social media platform. Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrencies in general all continue to split opinions. However, the voices in the detracting camps are becoming quieter, especially if they are just single voices. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, called Bitcoin a fraud and spouted much vitriol about cryptocurrencies - and yet, JP Morgan is building its own blockchain, Quorum. The Head of Microsoft is in a similar situation as he says he would bet on Bitcoin collapsing while his company pushes to be a blockchain leader. So Facebook, Google, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and Amazon are all evaluating or offering blockchain related products. I don't think blockchain tech is going to solve world hunger or cure cancer, but if you don't think it's here to stay? Many of these older viewpoints about how things were done, the centralized control of a sector and the move to monopolize a service, still reside in the likes of Gates and Dimon, but on the company floor, it is a different story. Blockchain technology is being touted as the future, and it is not just empty words. The amount of money, time and effort being put into blockchain-based research and development by banks and corporations prove there is something more to it than a passing fad.	2
UNICEF (United Nations International Children���s Emergency Fund) has started a new kind of charity drive for Syrian children, asking PC gamers to use their computers to mine Ethereum and donate their earnings. The two-month long charity campaign that began Feb. 2, dubbed Game Chaingers, is aimed at gamers that use high level graphics cards capable of cryptocurrency mining, turning the cards into ���humanitarian tool[s]:��� ���Today, humanitarian collections often solicit the same people with the same methods, but cryptocurrencies and their revolutionary approach are an opportunity to raise funds differently. Have you heard of Bitcoin? The Ethereum is the same, except that you can more easily ���mine��� the Ethereum coins via your computer and that money will go directly into the UNICEF wallet.��� Donations work in the following way: when participating gamers take a break from their computers or go to sleep, they can turn on UNICEF���s Ethereum mining program, thus donating without giving away anything but access to their computer���s processing power. The website reads: ���Through the use of mining we create an opportunity for those who can not give or have never had the opportunity to do so.���  Game Chaingers���s statistics currently shows a total of 360 contributors, 44 of which are currently active at press time, that have mined almost 900 euros in donations for humanitarian aid for Syrian children. According to the website���s project info, 8.3 mln children in Syria and bordering countries are in need of vital emergency help. UNICEF will use the donated Ethereum to give these children access to water, education, and health and hygiene services. This isn���t the first time that UNICEF has thought to mix cryptocurrencies and humanitarian aid. In January 2017, UNICEF presented ���Donercoin��� at London Blockchain Week, a Blockchain-based program aimed at creating transparency in global aid by digitizing donations. More recently, in August 2017, UNICEF Ventures, a branch of the main organization, began testing Ethereum-based smart contracts also to improve the transparency of asset transfers. Pineapple Fund, a Bitcoin-only charity founded by an anonymous donor, has also made large donations in Bitcoin to a number of philanthropic organizations in the past few months. According to their website, the Fund plans to give out a total of $86 mln to charity.	1
The Bitcoin price increased by more than 10% in a 24-hour span, rising from $7,020 to $7,770 on both spot and futures exchanges. But, BTC is showing all three signs that the upsurge was a bull trap. Negative futures funding rate before the rally, altcoins failing to front-run Bitcoin, and the BTC price running into a multi-year resistance level all point toward the recent price spike being a fakeout. On Binance Futures, the funding rate of Bitcoin dropped to as low as -0.03% prior to the abrupt increase in price.  Bitcoin funding rate chart across all futures exchanges. Source: Skew Futures exchanges like BitMEX and Binance Futures use a system called funding to provide balance in the market for both long and short contract holders. If there are more short contracts in the market, then the funding rate turns negative and traders shorting BTC have to compensate long contract holders with a portion of their positions. As an example, if a trader places a $50,000 short on Bitcoin and the funding rate is -0.03%, then the trader has to pay $15 every eight hours, so $45 in total per day to long contract holders. When the Bitcoin price started to increase and the funding rate remained negative on April 23, it created an unfavorable environment for sellers, as they were paying a part of their positions while the value of their trades was swiftly declining. That forced short holders to close or adjust their positions, adding to the already rising buying demand in a short period of time. It ultimately converted into a short squeeze, liquidating $79 million worth of shorts on BitMEX alone. A short squeeze was expected due to the negative funding rate, but the momentum of the rally dwindled quickly, raising skepticism towards the strength of the upside move. Typically, in an extended and sustainable Bitcoin rally, major alternative cryptocurrencies in the likes of Ether (ETH) and XRP tend to rise in tandem with BTC, frontrunning it at times. During the time the Bitcoin price increased by seven percent, the price of Ether rallied by around seven percent, underperforming against BTC. The lack of high volatility in the altcoin market amidst a Bitcoin uptrend indicates that there are not many buyers in the cryptocurrency market willing to take additional risks in the short-term. The spike in the Bitcoin price came to a halt at $7,770, a level that has acted as a resistance level since early 2018.  BTCUSD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The $7,700 to $8,300 range has served as one of the heaviest resistance areas alongside the $10,500 to $11,000 range since January of 2018. With $7,900 and $8,000 being historically important simple moving average (SMA) resistance levels, it is highly improbable that BTC breaks both levels at once without any rejection, which may cause a steep downtrend following the halving in mid-May. One variable, however, is that April through July have consistently been strong months for Bitcoin throughout the past several years and the upcoming halving falls into the three-month range.	2
Bitcoin���s (BTC) price has risen dramatically over the past days and weeks, recently wheeling past $40,000. An asset largely untied to governmental authority, Bitcoin is a hedge against global uncertainty, according to venture capitalist and billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya. Citing a possible five or 10-year time horizon, Palihapitiya said he thinks Bitcoin will likely reach $200,000 at some point. ���The reason is because, everytime you see all of this stuff happening, it just reminds you that wow our leaders are not as trustworthy and reliable as they used to be,��� he told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. He added: Since the pandemic gripped the world in 2020, governments around the world have taken various measures to combat its economic impact. The United States in particular has printed and spent massive sums of dollars.  Borderless and run by the people, Bitcoin allows holders to control their funds by themselves ��� no centralized authority required. Additionally, in October 2020, Fidelity released a report showing Bitcoin���s lack of price correlation to other markets, such as gold and stocks.  ���It���s going to eventually transition to something much more important, but for right now, you���re just getting all these data points that prove this thing,��� Palihapitiya said of Bitcoin, adding: Crypto has seen a noteworthy amount of adoption since the beginning of 2020, including large players gaining interest in BTC. Some influential financial figures, however, such as Shark Tank���s Kevin O���Leary, still remain skeptical on Bitcoin, citing regulation as a potential issue.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has previously classified Bitcoin as a commodity, although recent action shows increased regulatory overwatch on the crypto space, partly evident in a government proposal limiting self-custody digital asset wallets.	1
As the Crypto Twitter community debates the fair value of Cryptopunks and other NFTs rising to sky-high valuations, there���s at least one clear sign of the digital collectibles market growing irrational: An individual posing as Banksy, perhaps the most famous living artist, has netted over $1 million in Ether (ETH) in NFT sales.  Starting on Sunday, Feb. 14, frequent browsers of the NFT marketplaces Opensea and Rarible noticed an account named ���Pest Supply��� with branding and nonfungible tokens made in Banksy���s signature graffiti-stencil style. Many were quick to jump in, given the ���real��� Banksy���s habit for pop-up installations: I either just blew $750 or got the deal of lifetime on a Banksy... we shall see.https://t.co/YSMULcspgY? #rarible #ethereum #nonfungible #digitalasset #nft via @rariblecom Wallet profiler Nansen shows that the individual���s listed address first became active on Feb. 13 and was most active yesterday, Feb. 19. Before Opensea wiped much of the account history and disabled further sales, the account���s records showed hundreds of sales to buyers ranging from 0.116 ETH to over 60 ETH for a piece titled ���NFT morons.��� Noted whale wallet 0xb1 also made a few purchases, including one transaction worth 34 ETH, or $68,000. In an email obtained by Cointelegraph, Banksy���s ���legal guardian,��� Pest Control, has denied any association with the NFTs. Likewise, the individual has indicated that they are selling knock-offs, comparing themselves to artist Elaine Sturtevant, who was known for inexact replicas of more popular artists��� work, on their Rarible bio.  The account has taken in 512 ETH total, per Nansen, with nearly 430 ETH sent to a secondary address. The individual���s Rarible page includes a set of screenshots and Etherscan transactions ostensibly proving 23.5 ETH in donations to Save The Children, a humanitarian organization ��� less than 5% of the individual���s total haul.  Duped collectors are now left wondering, however: Were we tricked? Could it be a double-bluff and a genuine Banksy installation? Do the NFTs have value either way?  Max Osiris, a prominent crypto artist, tipped off the community that Banksy���s ���legal guardian,��� Pest Control, had denied any association with the NFTs in an email:  Re: Banksy @rariblecom thing"No way shape or form" pic.twitter.com/IKTjnqHFpw The email exchange, which Osiris forwarded to Cointelegraph, shows Osiris asking if the NFTs are Banksy works listed ���legit undercover,��� and Pest Control responding by saying ���there isn���t an affiliation in any way, shape or form.��� Cointelegraph has reached out to Pest Control and received no response.  This alone doesn���t prove that the NFTs are faked Banksy work, however, as Pest Control is known for denying association with ongoing installations. Instead, the individual���s Rarible page is now the clearest indication that they are not associated with Banksy.  Sturtevant is known for recreating the works of more famous artists from memory, a method that some believe raises philosophical questions regarding the nature of authenticity and originality.  The art blog NFT Art Review supports the view that the fake Banksy is working in this mode, writing that the individual performed ���phenomenal appropriation art that dissects the perception from the collecting circle and how value can be created from satire.���  The individual may have updated their Rarible bio on Friday night in direct response to the the blog, which was published on Friday morning.  Osiris believes it���s ultimately up to the collector to make these value judgements, and it���s also up to them to protect themselves from fakes ��� whatever that means. ���Yes, I think art has value even if it���s a fake because it���s up to the collector to figure out what they���re getting. In a sense this is a pretty successful art project, especially if the money goes to where they claim it will go,��� he said, referencing the individual���s charity efforts.  Two of the currently listed works done in Banksy���s style are priced at over 100 ETH, or $200,000 each. The individual claims to have donated roughly $47,000 to charity.  Noted NFT collector-whale Pranksy marked perhaps the clearest sign of an overheated market with his own NFT run, a true hat-on-a-hat named ���Pest Demand.��� While he says he made the run in an effort to ���mock��� the fake Banksy, he instead made 12 ETH, or $24,000, in sales.  ���People bought it because they are all euphoric,��� Pranksy said.  Artist ���Twerky Pepe��� highlighted the absurdity of the situation with a tweet, in which they promoted their Pranksy purchase as either a good investment or a fun, ironic buy (the Cointelegraph weekend editorial team was unable to divine which): I am the owner of a fake Banksy but an original prank by Pranksy @pranksyNFT pic.twitter.com/pixPzncixk Osiris agrees that the collectors and speculators are overeager at this stage in the market and says that the artist, in fact, exploited those very sentiments.  ���It���s a clever slight-of-hand move by someone who timed the excitement of ���celebrities��� coming into the space, the mystery of Banksy���s modus operandi, and Rarible���s verification system,��� he said. The individual was able to gain a Rarible ���yellow checkmark��� because they were not, in technicality, posing as Banksy, just using Banksy���s style and legal likeness.  It���s mania that may only get worse, he said. Sales for the individual���s fake Banksies continue apace, with at least a dozen NFTs purchased in the last twelve hours.	2
In a substantially important announcement for cryptocurrencies in South Korea, the second largest bank in the country, Shinhan Bank, has announced that it is in the process of building cryptocurrency wallets for customers to store their digital assets securely. The report comes after Bithumb servers crashed in November, and private data for 30,000 users was leaked in June. The new service would be more secure than outside services, according to the bank���s spokesman. The bank will offer deposits with no fee, but withdrawals will have a fee attached. Per the bank���s statement: "It is a service that keeps the Blockchain key through the virtual safe provided by the bank. We are looking for ways to provide a free service when depositing and charge a fee when withdrawing.���  The announcement adds further support to the substantial growth in institutional adoption. With recent announcements regarding Bitcoin futures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as well as a large number new Bitcoin hedge funds, mainstream institutional adoption continues to grow.	2
A post on the Ethereum blog today informs users of a bug in Mist Browser Beta that could potentially allow private keys to be stolen by malicious websites. The vulnerability affects Mist Browser Beta v0.9.3 and below. A security alert from the Mist team published today on the Ethereum blog highlights how security update discrepancies across Mist, its underlying platform Electron, and the Chromium browser could compromise data privacy. The alert states: ���Due to a Chromium vulnerability affecting all released versions of the Mist Browser Beta v0.9.3 and below, we are issuing this alert warning users not to browse untrusted websites with Mist Browser Beta at this time.��� However they note that users of the Ethereum Wallet desktop app are not affected. In the period following high-profile Ethereum-related security issues, notably Parity���s notorious hack and accidental quarantine of funds, developers are conspicuously keen to highlight their commitment to keeping on top of new problems. The complex three-tier setup in Mist, Electron and Chromium nonetheless presents hurdles to security. In the security alert, the Mist team explains the complexities involved that cause vulnerability, saying: ���A core problem with the current architecture is that any 0-day Chromium vulnerability is several patch-steps away from Mist: first Chromium needs to be patched, then Electron needs to update the Chromium version, and finally, Mist needs to update to the new Electron version.��� Mist browser users are advised to follow a seven-step checklist to ensure maximum safety:	0
In early 2016, the masternodes that comprise Dash���s governance system voted overwhelmingly to upgrade to 2MB blocks, with 99 percent of the network in favor. Many in the cryptocurrency world saw this as a simple attention-getting gimmick, as Dash���s development priorities became focused elsewhere. However, with the recent release of Dash version 12.2, it looks like larger blocks will be implemented soon. The version 12.2 upgrade is one step on the way to Dash Evolution, the currency���s plan to make ���digital [currencies] be so easy to use your Grandma would use them.��� Core developer UdjinM6 wrote of the recent update: The most notable changes are: Of course, larger blocks aren���t needed yet, as the currency does not process enough transactions to fill its current blocks. However, this blocksize increase follows the on-chain scaling plan announced by founder Evan Duffield earlier this year. Duffield announced that through the use of custom hardware, Dash will create a network that can scale to large numbers of transactions by using big blocks. Duffield wrote: Many projects in the space believe that on-chain scaling is impossible. That���s simply because they haven���t explored alternative P2P architectures for higher performance. We intend to show just how far an incentivized second tier [masternode] architecture can take a project like Dash. Bitcoin, of course, has chosen to follow a different path. With the planned SegWit2x upgrade officially dead, the currency is now firmly on the path of off-chain scaling through the lightning network or similar solutions. The lightning network is intended to work by moving transactions off-chain onto ���payment channels��� and then ���settling��� the result to the Bitcoin Blockchain periodically. For instance, if Bob pays Alice one BTC, then he later pays her two BTC, and finally sends her 1.5 BTC, that���s three separate transactions that need to be recorded to the Blockchain. With lightning network, however, only the net transaction would need to be posted to the Blockchain once the payment channel was closed. In this case, only one transaction would be posted for a total of 4.5 BTC sent from Bob to Alice. Critics have asked how often payment channels will really be used, but until the network is deployed, it���s impossible to say. Others suggest that moving transactions off-chain damages the decentralized and immutable nature of Bitcoin. Supporters point out that transactions happen off-chain all the time, for instance on exchanges. No Bitcoin exchange posts a separate transaction to the Blockchain every time funds are moved internally. Only the final result is posted, once a user withdraws funds. Number two cryptocurrency Ethereum isn���t just sitting on the sidelines, either. The currency plans to implement the ���Raiden Network��� which will utilize payment channels similar to Bitcoin���s proposed lightning network. While Bitcoin assiduously avoids hard forks whenever possible, Dash welcomes them. The key to Dash���s upgrade strategy is the ���spork��� a mechanism that allows portions of the upgrade to be ���turned off��� if there is a problem on the network. An example is something called ���enforcement.��� The Dash network normally requires miners to share the block reward with masternodes; miners who attempt to keep the entire reward to themselves will find their blocks rejected by the network. However, during an upgrade, enforcement can (and usually is) be turned off. This allows both miners and masternodes a reasonable amount of time to upgrade their software while eliminating the risk of uncontrollable forking caused by one part of the network rejecting the other part. It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin, Ethereum or Dash will be successful in solving the scalability problem. Both the ���payment channels��� and ���really big blocks��� scaling methods have their critics, and neither has been thoroughly vetted yet. It���s possible that another solution might emerge in the interim, or that both solutions could be workable. The one thing that���s certain, however, is that for digital currency to become a real force in the world, tens of thousands of people will need to be able to transact all at the same time. A successful mainstream cryptocurrency must be able to scale to Visa���s level or beyond.	2
After a $11 million attack earlier today, Rari Capital is the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol to fall victim to a high-priced exploit  The platform, which builds optimized yield vaults and boutique lending pools, confirmed the attack in a Tweet and said that a full postmortem is forthcoming: There has been an exploit in the Rari Capital ETH Pool related to our @AlphaFinanceLab integration. The rebalancer has removed all funds from Alpha in response. We are currently investigating the situation and a full report will be shared once everything is assessed. Per whitehat hacker Emiliano Bonassi, the exploit appears to be an ���evil contract��� exploit, in which an attacker ���tricks��� a contract into thinking a hostile contract should have access or permissions. Alpha Finance announced in a Tweet that the hack was related to Rari���s interest-bearing ibETH vault, but that no Alpha funds were at risk: Funds are SAFE on #AlphaHomora. We are notified that @RariCapital has suffered from an exploit that was due to the incorrect assumption when using HomoraBank contract, as they were setting up an ibETH pool on their platform.#Alpha team is here to help. The hacker���s wallet currently holds 4,005 ETH worth over $15,000,000, but a portion of those funds appear to be from a separate exploit.  Like many before him, the attacker appears to have considered sending a message to the Rari team, but cancelled the transaction. Because he paid a low gas fee, however, observers were able to notice the message as a pending transaction before it was cancelled:  The hacker has left a base64-encoded message sayingrari=REKTalpha=ok # saved rari 6mhttps://t.co/WQpiPksDOX pic.twitter.com/ruMH8Wam5s While taking the aborted victory lap, the attacker���s message also seemed to imply that the Alpha Homura team prevented an additional $6 million drain.  Already users are taking to Twitter to speculate about what form the team���s compensation plan might take. Compensating users affected by hacks and exploits is becoming an increasingly common practice, most recently with EasyFi revealing their compensation plan after a crippling $60 million exploit. The Rari Capital team has often been a target of both community support and derision. The team is notably young, with one developer reportedly being 15 years old. One of their key investors, Twitter user Tetranode, joked on a recent Up Only podcast that, despite only being middle aged, the team frequently and playfully taunts him as a ���boomer.���  As such, while some have criticized the team and attempted to blame youthful inexperience for the attack, other have noted that security practices in DeFi are continually evolving and have been quick to voice support for the team, including SushiSwap CTO Joseph Delong: This is a tragedy, we love that team $RGT, Rari's governance token, is down 23.24% to $13.35 on the news.	0
Dara Khosrowshahi has been appointed as the new CEO of Uber, which has been without a CEO since the resignation of Travis Kalanick in June 2017. Would this result in Uber's stance on accepting Bitcoin changing? Dara Khosrowshahi, who became the CEO of Expedia in 2005, is seen to be an inspired choice for the job of Uber CEO. He built Expedia into one of the world's leading travel and technology companies. Expedia had announced that it would accept Bitcoin as a means of payment in 2014, which made it one of the earliest companies to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment. In 2014, Bitcoin was yet to become an established means of payment. The Mt.Gox fueled bubble of 2013 and the subsequent crash had made companies wary of Bitcoin. While it was possible to book air tickets using niche Bitcoin players like CheapAir and BTC trip, mainstream companies largely ignored Bitcoin. Expedia though took a brave decision to accept Bitcoins and other companies ranging from Dell to Rakuten joined the bandwagon. Bitcoin enthusiasts have always felt that Uber and Bitcoin had a natural fit and it was strange that Uber was resisting the adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method. Uber was started in 2009 (a year after Bitcoin was created) and has grown to become a global behemoth. Uber operates in multiple geographies and is dependent on credit card processors for a majority of its payments. If you use your credit card while traveling in Uber in a foreign country, you will incur a host of charges including charges for international usage, currency mark up, etc. If Bitcoin were accepted, all these could be avoided. While Uber does not directly accept Bitcoin in its ride hailing app, users have been able to use payment processors like Coinbase to pay for rides using Bitcoin in the past. Uber had also switched to accepting Bitcoin (through Xapo and other debit cards) in Argentina after the government decided to ban the app and asked local credit card processors not to service it. There have been periodic rumors in the past about Uber planning to accept Bitcoin, but the company has been quick to squash them. Adding Bitcoin as a payment option would not result in significant addition of new customers to Uber, given that Uber already has significant penetration in its existing markets. It would only be a symbolic gesture to indicate support to the crypto community and to keep payment processors on their toes. Dara has far bigger problems to worry about at Uber, more particularly allegations of a culture which supported gender discrimination and sexual harassment.	1
Wednesday, September 5: crypto markets have suffered a sharp decline within one hour, with total market cap down $12 billion and almost all of the top 100 coins by market cap in red, according to CoinMarketCap.

The latest findings in Cointelegraph Consulting���s biweekly newsletter suggest that Ether won���t sustain its rally. The 365-day market-value-to-realized-value ratio of Ethereum���s native Ether (ETH) token is currently at a two-year high of 1.88. This indicates that Ether���s long-term holders are presently up 88% on their initial investment, on average. This is the highest average profit for Ether���s long-term holders since February 2018, and there���s a rising incentive to sell and take profits. Over the past 30 days, the collective balance of Ether mining pools has shrunk by more than 80,000 ETH (around $35,000,000 at current prices), suggesting some level of concern among the ETH mining community about the coin���s short-term price potential. On-chain data points to a string of recent spikes in the ���dormant circulation��� of ETH coins that haven���t moved addresses in the past 365 days. Over the last month, the dormant circulation has increased by 58.6% (compared with the month before), pointing to a potential sell-off from ETH holders and long-term investors. The last 24 hours have recorded one of the largest bearish divergences in the history of the Santiment trading model, showing a negative 106% divergence of daily active addresses, compared with its median expected value, when aligned with the median expected values of daily price closes.

This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. China has not had the steadiest relationship with Bitcoin. Once, it was the center of the cryptocurrency universe, until it got too big for its boots and starting drawing attention from the controlling government. The bans came, first for ICOs then for exchanges, yet, this only slowed rather than stopped the growth of Bitcoin in general, and cryptocurrencies as a whole, in the People���s Republic. The idea was to stamp out Bitcoin and its affiliates as the Chinese government took exception to this freedom of money and the movement of it over the borders. However, even though these bans were unprecedented and harsh, they never really laid the killing blow. The idea is now that the Chinese government will shut the last door on crypto activity in the state with this ban on trading with a foreign platform through a massive firewall. This move comes only because the regulators had to admit that their previous bans were ineffective. This is another step towards Bitcoin blackout in China, with their state-owned social media and search engines wiping clean any trace of cryptocurrency and ICO advertising in the past few days. This is in line with Facebook���s decision to do the same. Regulation of the cryptocurrency space has been a very divided subject for a lot of nations who have been forced into action by its monumental growth. Mostly it is a case by case scenario where different nations choose their level of control; Japan has accepted the currency and is playing a wait-and-see game, while China is trying to lead the way in terms of stern action. In an article which was recounted by the South China Morning Post, it explained the reasoning for this latest move. The article acknowledged that recent attempts to stamp out digital currencies by shutting down domestic exchanges had failed to completely eradicate trading: ���ICOs and virtual currency trading did not completely withdraw from China following the official ban ��� after the closure of the domestic virtual currency exchanges, many people turned to overseas platforms to continue participating in virtual currency transactions...Overseas transactions and regulatory evasion have resumed ��� risks are still there, fueled by illegal issuance, and even fraud and pyramid selling.��� This is the Chinese government���s last shot at stamping out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, something that will be eagerly watched by many regulators in terms of a possible avenue to follow. However, should it fail and Bitcoin find another way to function in a society that has become accustomed and ingrained with it, then the regulators will take a big hit in their hard-nosed approach. This could actually be a defining moment for regulation that will either lead to blanket bans popping up all over or it could force the governments to come off their high horses and accept and integrate Bitcoin and others.	0
Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has said that Bitcoin is not a currency - and not even a cryptocurrency. In remarks at a Beijing conference, Villeroy stressed the need for ���clarity��� on Bitcoin���s status, while introducing an unusual angle which so far has not surfaced as part of the mainstream narrative. ���We need to be clear: Bitcoin is in no way a currency or even a cryptocurrency,��� he said quoted by Bank of France in various publications. ���It is a speculative asset. Its value and extreme volatility have no economic basis, and they are nobody���s responsibility.��� Repeating bearish warnings more common to central banks throughout the world over the past few years, Villeroy added that the Bank of France ���reminds those investing in Bitcoin that they do so entirely at their own risk.��� The concept that Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency stands out among the more unexpected utterances from famous economic sources this week. Speaking to Bloomberg, that network���s CEO and Founder Michael R. Bloomberg even confused Bitcoin and Blockchain, coming out with a newly-coined term ���Bitchain.��� Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, also present at the interview, was on hand to correct him, before Bloomberg continued that his network basically was, in fact, a Blockchain. ���In fact, the Bloomberg system is a Blockchain; it���s just that instead of having the users control it, we control it,��� he said. ���But it has all the attributes of that.��� Secret symbol ��� 21: Y What is this?	1
Austrac, Australia���s financial crime control agency, has alleged that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had delayed or failed to report more than 50,000 cases of suspicious transactions of cash deposited through its automated cash deposit machines. Automated machines and banks seem to be the favorite methods of drugs rings to launder money. Australia has stringent laws on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, which impose monitoring obligations on designated services, including financial institutions, bullion traders and gambling services. It is alleged that CommBank had delayed or failed to report over 50,000 suspicious transactions, totaling up to almost AUD$77 mln involving automated cash deposit machines.   Austrac���s acting CEO Peter Clark said in a statement: ���By failing to have sound AML/CTF systems and controls in place, businesses are at risk of being misused for criminal purposes. AUSTRAC's goal is to have a financial sector that is vigilant and capable of responding, including through innovation, to threats of criminal exploitation." The penalties for breach of reporting obligations under the Australian anti-money laundering law are steep ��� up to AUD$8 mln per breach. Tabcorp Holdings, Australia���s largest bookmaker, had a case with 108 alleged breaches filed against it and paid AUD$45 mln in fines to settle it. Banks have been engulfed by scandals in the recent past, ranging from facilitating tax evasion, fixing Libor rate, misselling products, etc. The perception that undue risks taken by bankers contributed to the global financial crisis is also one of the reasons for the unfavorable public opinion about banks. The banking sector has however survived these scandals and has become an important arm of governments��� intelligence gathering. Huge regulatory fines and penalties are a tool used by governments to ensure that banks take this role seriously. Bitcoin provides pseudonymity to its users, with users being able to hide behind a Bitcoin address. Other cryptocurrencies like Monero and Dash have improved on its privacy features. However, these are just tools, like the Internet and can be used by ordinary people as well as criminals. As these drug rings have shown, you don���t need to be tech savvy and use Bitcoin to launder money; good old cash and ATMs can be sufficient.	0
DOGE-1, the first crypto-funded mission to the moon, is set to launch early next year following a new partnership between two blockchain companies and manufacturer Geometric Energy Corporation, also known as GEC. Smart exchange ecosystem Unizen and decentralized finance incubator ZenX announced Wednesday that they are in the process of building and launching DOGE-1, a 40-kilogram ��� roughly 88 pounds ��� CubeSat that will provide a new use case for cryptocurrencies. The CubeSat will travel to a ���stable lunar orbit��� in order to obtain lunar-spatial intelligence from sensors and cameras that will be sent back to GEC for analysis.  The CubeSat will be deployed through a launch agreement with SpaceX FalconX slated for the first quarter of 2022, though no hard dates were provided. Over 1,600 CubeSats have been launched to date, but unlike DOGE-1, they���ve traveled into Low Earth Orbit, which is between 100 and 1,200 miles above the Earth���s surface. Traveling to lunar orbit puts DOGE-1 250,000 miles away from Earth.  ���NASA���s CAPSTONE was set to be the first cubesat to reach the moon, but it has been delayed a number of times and has a current launch date of late March 2022,��� the companies said. ���This means that DOGE-1 could be the first cubesat in history to reach the moon, marking a significant achievement for global spaceflight.��� As Cointelegraph previously reported, the Dogecoin-funded project was first introduced in May of this year, with a planned launch date as early as the first quarter of 2022. At the time, SpaceX vice president of commercial sales Tom Ochinero said the ���mission will demonstrate the application of cryptocurrency beyond Earth orbit and set the foundation for interplanetary commerce.���  SpaceX launching satellite Doge-1 to the moon next year��� Mission paid for in Doge��� 1st crypto in space��� 1st meme in spaceTo the mooooonnn!!https://t.co/xXfjGZVeUW Dogecoin (DOGE) rose to prominence earlier this year thanks in part to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who touted the memecoin���s virtues and even claimed to work with its developers to improve its efficiency. The Musk-inspired surge may have added billions to DOGE���s market capitalization at a time when more mainstream users were getting into cryptocurrency.	2
Chinese platform NEO���s founder Da Hongfei has said a Bitcoin bubble is ���OK��� and will come back stronger if it bursts. Speaking in a televised interview on CNBC, Hongfei explained that the overlapping wave of enthusiasm in both Bitcoin and Blockchain was not necessarily a problem. ���I would say that there is a bubble in this industry, but would say it���s OK,��� he explained on the network���s Capital Connection segment. ���Every technology that is so disruptive - there���ll definitely be bubbles, like the train or the automobile.��� The topic of Bitcoin���s rapid price rise this year producing a bubble is a favorite of cryptocurrency naysayers such as prominent banking figures and mainstream media outlets. Speculation about prices collapsing continues this week as Bitcoin passes $11,000 amid considerable volatility. Continuing about the prognosis, however, Hongfei speculated that Blockchain had already mostly completed its bubble-like phase. ���With Blockchain, probably I believe we are in the later stage of a bubble, but even if it bursts, I think next times when it comes up it will be bigger again,��� he said. Perhaps the most pessimistic mainstream view of Bitcoin to come from the traditional banking sphere, JPMorgan���s CEO Jamie Dimon predicted the virtual currency would rise to around $20,000 before losing most of its value.	2
Pineapple Fund has donated $1 mln in Bitcoins to the Internet Archive this Saturday. Pineapple is a Bitcoin-only charity established in early December 2017, whose ultimate goal is to give $86 mln worth of Bitcoin to various nonprofit organizations. For early adopters, Bitcoin���s massive rise in value has been a remarkable ride from rags to riches, and some are now deciding to give back. The Pineapple Fund has been launched by an anonymous person who goes by the username /u/PineappleFund on Reddit. The donor has created a website to issue reports as to which organizations have been given Bitcoin donations so far. It also includes a form for those nonprofits who would like to apply for future donations. To date, the charity has given 657 BTC - approximately $8.5 mln - to 13 organizations, which focus on specific areas, such as providing clean water to sub-Saharan Africa, building technology for universal healthcare and improving the treatment of age-related diseases. The fund���s homepage claims: ���Our main themes are supporting medical research, gender equality and taking innovative approaches to do good in this world.��� The motive for the donation is explicit on the site as well: ���Donating $86 mln of Bitcoins to charity. Because once you have enough money, money doesn���t matter.��� Many early adopters of Bitcoin have been in the news recently. For example, the Winklevoss brothers purchased approximately one percent of the outstanding supply of BTC in 2013 - an investment which has resulted in them becoming the first Bitcoin billionaires.	2
Tim Sweeney, the co-founder of the studio behind titles such as Hitman, Gears of War, and the wildly popular Fortnite said in a Tweet today that non-fungible token (NFT) tech and the ���metaverse��� it one day may enable are ���going places,��� but due to factors such as transactions costs and the ���wild, speculative mess��� that makes up much of crypto today, the dream of ���a persistent, live digital universe��� might be far off.  Sweeney made his comments in response to a blog titled ���Into The Void: Where Crypto Meets The Metaverse.��� Written by blockchain consulting, research and investment firm Delphi Digital partner Piers Kicks, ���Into The Void��� is a sprawling essay that dives into the history of digital connectivity and in-game economies, ultimately arguing that blockchain-based metaverses will not be a simple improvement over previous virtual experiences, but will instead mark the start of a new human epoch: In a short Tweet thread Sweeney praised the blog post and acknowledged that blockchain tech and NFTs are the ���most plausible path��� towards a fully emergent metaverse, but also indicated that these developments may be far off and that investors should be cautious with their money: Disclaimers!1) The state of the art is far from the 60Hz transactional medium needed for 100M���s of concurrent users in a real-time 3D simulation2) Don���t read this as an endorsement of cryptocurrency investment; that���s a wild, speculative messBut the tech is going places. ���It's immensely exciting to see recognition of the potential of these technologies from Tim, who is undoubtedly the leading pioneer of change within the game industry and beyond,��� Kicks said in a statement to Cointelegraph. ���[...] Almost everything out there right now is not yet ready to be mainstream consumer facing. It's not just scalability that's a bottleneck, there are still major UX frictions across the board.��� ���It may well be largely speculative right now, but for those willing to engage it's a very exciting time as the market hunts for viable, scalable business and incentive models. Where mainstream perceptions of crypto are concerned, the tides do appear to be gradually changing,��� he added.  Sweeney isn���t the only big-name entrepreneur to dip their toes into NFTs in recent weeks. On Monday Mark Cuban released a run of 10 limited-edition NFT animations of himself dancing. All sold out within hours, and on-chain sleuths identified two wallets associated with Cuban that contained dozens of small cryptocurrencies, as well as significant holdings in DeFi projects such as Aave and Sushiswap ��� all of which lent credence to Cuban���s prior statement that he likes to ���try this stuff out.��� Shortly after the drop, however, Cuban said in a television interview NFT prices are ���inflated��� due to low interest rates, indicating that his interest in NFTs might be purely exploratory.  Both Cuban and Sweeney have good reason to question the sky-high valuations currently overtaking the space. Last weekend a rare CryptoPunk sold for 605 ETH, or over $750,000 at the time of the sale, and prominent collectors are being quoted on the evening news.  However, as is often the case in crypto development carries on apace regardless of if there���s a bubble or not, and a blockchain-enabled metaverse may be closer than even these founders and investors realize.	2
One of the reasons that Bitcoin is capturing the hearts and minds of individuals is the stories of instant millionaires who have made their fortune from being an early adopter. People who were mining the coin or accumulating it by the hundred, and were smart enough to hold onto it today are experiencing unprecedented profit. With the monumental price gain, however, people are starting to wonder where the ceiling is, and if it is not fast approaching. To this end, there is a section of the population who are wondering: ���is it too late to get into Bitcoin?��� However, this is not a new question, it is a question that was asked when Bitcoin was at $10, $100, $1,000 all the way up to over $17,000 where it sits today. There is, of course, no doubting that those who were really early to the party are the biggest profiteers, and for envy���s sake, it is worth looking at what has been achieved in just seven years. Had you put $100 into Bitcoin starting back in 2010, and going through the years, you would have made massive profits along the way. July 28, 2010: $100 back in 2010 - baring in mind this is a full two years after Satoshi Nakamoto put out his whitepaper on Bitcoin - would net you at today���s value a whopping $28,341,266. One Bitcoin back then was worth just $0.06 Dec. 12, 2011: Within 18 months, there would have been plenty time to get involved in Bitcoin, but by this time the price was up over 3,000 percent, and people were already asking, ���is it too late?���. Bitcoin was worth $3.19 and $100 back then would net you over half a million dollars ($533,065) Dec. 10, 2012: A year later, and Bitcoin was still climbing high, now breaking into the teens sitting at $13.54, a gain of 300 percent. $100 would have turned to $125. Still remarkably impressive in terms of gains, but slowing somewhat from 18 months earlier - Does that mean its rise is coming to an end perhaps? Dec. 16, 2013: Hindsight is, of course, a fantastic thing as the next year the price of Bitcoin was up to $638 and thus doubling as an investment. So, $100 worth back then would be pocket change right? Well, it would be worth $2,665 today. Dec. 8, 2014: Bitcoin was starting to be heard in whispers around the dinner table about now, but people also heard that there were black markets, hacks, and other nefarious uses, yet $100 worth back then would be worth $4,859 today. Dec. 12, 2016: Through the harder years from 2014 and the slowed growth, Bitcoin would not have been that attractive, but really, it would have been a perfect time to buy. The explosion was just about to happen. Bitcoin was trading for $780. Had you put $100 into it, that investment would have increased by more than 2,000 percent to $2,180. June 12, 2017: Six months ago, no one thought Bitcoin could go much higher than the $2,500 it stood at. But of course, it was about to take off again. Dec. 5, 2017: This week alone has seen some crazy movement. Had you bought $100 worth of Bitcoin just a few days ago, you could sell it today for $145. Dec. 10, 2017: ��� If you had bought at the low on Sunday���s slump (when prices fell to $13,160), that $100 would be worth $129. No one knows what will come next, but it could be safe to say that pretty much anyone who bought Bitcoin more than a week ago is profiting already. They may still be classified as early investors, or they may not, and although they may not experience gains of 3,000 percent, the feeling is Bitcoin has a long way to grow. Ronnie Moas, a famed stock picker has put forward an argument that Bitcoin is highly undervalued even at today���s prices. Moas said: ���We currently have $200 tln in the world tied up in cash, stocks, bonds and gold alone and all four of those, in my opinion, are overvalued. If 1/2 of one percent of that 200 tln dollars ends up in Bitcoin, you are looking at a one tln dollar valuation that would be above where Apple Computers, the most valuable company in the World, is today.���	1
A group of extremely savvy analysts started evaluating how much and where ETH transactions were being processed. What they found was a bit of a surprise. According to the analysis, over 65 percent of all ETH transactions are generated using temporary addresses. In other words, funds come into the address and leave the address again, usually within an hour, and the addresses are never used again. The finding, on the cyberFund blog, indicates that an ���Ethereum mixer��� is moving funds into temporary addresses, mixing them around from address to address, and then outputting them into more fixed addresses on different exchanges. The graphic below indicates the process.   The issue with these transactions is that they represent a massive part of all Ethereum transactions taking place, indicating that funds are being moved rapidly, and for some purpose that is not evidently clear. The analysis that at least one of the following possible options must be true of the mixer. 1. The protection offered to clients by crypto-exchanges: all clients��� funds are mixed so that the funds��� sources cannot be tracked and those holding clean money cannot be unjustifiably accused of any illegal activity 2. A mechanism set in place to protect US residents who wish to avoid control from US regulatory bodies 3. A mechanism used by a large private exchange to preserve the privacy of its clients; this exchange might be operating with fiat money 4. A mechanism used to securely transfer crypto-assets between crypto-exchanges 5. Any kind of Ethereum-laundering scheme Which of these options is actually the purpose remains to be seen. However, if such a high volume of transactions is being carried out by a single mechanism, it calls into question the market growth of Ethereum and its actual use.	1
Bytecoin, an untraceable privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, has just seen an astronomical triple-digit percent surge in price. The cryptocurrency soared to the all time high market capitalisation of $444,000,000, before calming down to around $300,000,000 and establishing itself at the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization at the time of writing (according to CoinMarketCap). A symbolic turning point for one of the first untraceable cryptocurrencies launched in 2012. The price hike happens upon the flourishing investor interest in cryptocurrency markets, and in particular upon the growing public appreciation of untraceable cryptocurrencies that contain privacy mechanisms (other examples are Monero, Dash and Zcash, which have also experienced an increase in value in the recent months). The Bytecoin surge may also be attributed to the announcement of the new features, which include allegedly never-before-implemented untraceable tokens - also known as ���digital assets��� or ���colored coins���. Amid the Bytecoin price rise, a cryptocurrency Monero has released a statement disclosing a vulnerability in the CryptoNote protocol, that underlies both Monero and Bytecoin cryptocurrencies. As written in the statement, the bug ���allows for the creation of an unlimited number of coins in a way that is undetectable to an observer unless they know about the fatal flaw and can search for it.��� The statement does not list Bytecoin as one of the currencies that have updated the protocol following the detection of the bug. According to the official response from the Bytecoin, its development team has been aware of the vulnerability in April 2017, when during software testing it has discovered that several malicious transactions creating 504 million Bytecoins had appeared in the network - which accounts for 0.2% of the total 183 billion Bytecoin supply. The development team states that it patched the bug and worked with the mining services to update their software (that validates the transactions in the network), as soon as the bug was found. According to Minergate, the major Bytecoin mining pool, it was contacted by the Bytecoin team in the mid April and ���the fix to the mining software has been implemented by adding more checks for the transactions consistency��� shortly thereafter. The updated version prevented blocks with malicious transactions to be mined and thus no extra coins could be created. The questions still remain about the cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, who are supposedly ���safe to stick with the previous version of software���, according to the Bytecoin statement, but ���encouraged to update the protocol���. In spite of this bug discovery and patching, the CryptoNote-based cryptocurrency markets, including Monero and Bytecoin, has been positive, keeping them among the top 10 by capitalisation. Whether it is because the coin holders are not well-informed of the protocol issues or they are confident of the development teams��� ability to manage these issues, the fact remains that Monero���s and Bytecoin���s capitalizations jointly amount to $750,000,000 at the time of writing, and as a result many early adopters have gone from rags to riches. With the ICO phenomenon coming into place this may not be all, as new cryptocurrency teams emerge stating their intention to adopt the privacy-preserving CryptoNote protocol. In fact, if the concept of untraceable tokens (untraceable digital assets) becomes a reality this year as promised in the Bytecoin roadmap, the major trends of the crypto world could in theory converge: the booming ICO phenomenon, the increasing capitalisation of tokens created on top of various blockchain platforms, and the growing market interest in untraceability and privacy. We are here to observe and see.	2
Just over a month after delivering sceptical remarks on Bitcoin (BTC), SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is apparently rooting for major altcoin Dogecoin (DOGE) again. Already known as a big fan of DOGE, Musk has made yet another endorsement for the cryptocurrency in a March 3 tweet. While the initial tweet isn���t exactly crypto-related but just a shoob meme with caption ���Dogs rock,��� the subsequent tweet ��� ���They have the best coin ��� clearly shows Musk was talking about the Dogecoin. This is not the first time when the Tesla CEO has expressed his positive stance to Dogecoin though. In April 2019, Elon Musk tweeted that DOGE ���might be��� his favorite cryptocurrency, adding that it���s ���pretty cool.��� Musk is also known for his collaborative efforts with Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer in fighting against cryptocurrency scammers on Twitter. The famous technology entrepreneur has even been elected on Twitter to become the ���CEO��� of Dogecoin, leaving behind other candidates such as Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee. As reported by Cointelegraph, Dogecoin is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that was born out of the ���doge��� meme in honor of a dog of shiba-inu breed. Launched in 2013, DOGE became a widely-used cryptocurrency, with its popularity reportedly far exceeding expectations of its founder Billy Markus. Once a regular of the top 25 coins list by market capitalization, Dogecoin has slightly edged down to be ranked the 32 biggest cryptocurrency at press time, according to Coin360. The altcoin surged about 2% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.002 at press time.  Dogecoin 30-day price chart. Source: Coin360 Apparently one of the most beloved and influential figures in the crypto industry, Elon Musk has been actively discussing not only Dogecoin, but crypto in general. In March 2019, Musk complimented Bitcoin, claiming that its structure is ���quite brilliant,��� while the coin is ���a far better way to transfer value than pieces of paper.��� However, the Tesla chief might have disappointed some Bitcoin believers with his most recent remarks. As reported by Cointelegraph, Musk claimed on Jan. 20 that he is ���neither here nor there on Bitcoin,��� adding that Bitcoin is not his safe word. Particularly, the entrepreneur purportedly questioned the legal status of Bitcoin, opposing it to cryptocurrency in general by saying ���Cryptocurrency is my safe word.���	2
South Korea is becoming a Bitcoin and Ethereum powerhouse in terms of trading volumes, liquidity and activity. Over the past few months, South Korea���s three largest digital currency exchanges Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone have added support for Ethereum traders by integrating Ether. In a relatively short period of time, South Korea has become the largest Ethereum exchange market with a $335 mln daily trading volume and 38 percent market share. In fact, the ETH/KRW pair processes more trades than the ETH/BTC pair, which used to account for over 50 percent of all Ethereum trading. South Korea has also become one of the largest Bitcoin exchange markets in the world. Although South Korea is currently the fourth largest Bitcoin exchange market behind the US, China and Japan, a month ago, its trading volume and market share was larger than China and Japan and secured its spot as the second-largest Bitcoin exchange market for awhile. South Korea is becoming a #bitcoin / #ethereum powerhouse.   - Largest Ethereum Exchange Market  - 4th Largest Bitcoin Exchange Market pic.twitter.com/PpshRQhs0P South Korean investors within the cryptocurrency market are very easily moved and influenced by the media. Ethereum���s recent Enterprise Ethereum Alliance deals with large conglomerates such as Toyota and JPMorgan have further validated the value of Ethereum to more local investors and have shifted the trend from Bitcoin to Ethereum. More importantly, because Bitcoin has become a conservative asset amongst other cryptocurrencies, investors in South Korea have started to look into altcoins such as Ethereum and Ripple that are supported by local exchanges. Most South Korean exchanges are funded by multi-billion dollar corporations within the country. Korbit, South Korea���s second-largest exchange, is invested by SK Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in the country. Therefore, when exchanges add support for cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple, immediately, investors dive into altcoins. Particularly, investors that believe they missed Bitcoin���s rally invest in altcoins for large short and mid-term gains. The demand toward Bitcoin has increased to the point where there always exists a huge arbitrage opportunity for overseas traders. Bitcoin is being traded in South Korea with a premium price of $2,800. That is a 21 percent premium over the global average price and other major markets such as the US. While it is still possible to purchase Bitcoin outside of South Korea with other options such as credit cards to avoid premium rates, it is difficult to trade large amounts of Bitcoin without being flagged by anti-money laundering systems. If the current growth rate of the South Korean Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange markets can be sustained over the next few months, South Korea could become a powerhouse for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.	2
Anybody familiar with Bitcoin is aware of the vexing problem caused by the 1 MB blocksize limit and the controversy that arose over how to scale the network. It���s probably worthwhile to look back on how that limit came to exist, in hopes that future crises can be averted by a solid understanding of the past. In 2010, when the blocksize limit was introduced, Bitcoin was radically different than today. Theymos, administrator of both the Bitcointalk forum and /r/bitcoin subreddit, said, among other things: "No one anticipated pool mining, so we considered all miners to be full nodes and almost all full nodes to be miners. I didn't anticipate ASICs, which cause too much mining centralization. SPV is weaker than I thought. In reality, without the vast majority of the economy running full nodes, miners have every incentive to collude to break the network's rules in their favor. The fee market doesn't actually work as I described and as Satoshi intended for economic reasons that take a few paragraphs to explain." It seems that late in 2010, Satoshi realized there had to be a maximum block size, otherwise some miners might produce bigger blocks than other miners were willing to accept, and the chain could split. Therefore, Satoshi inserted a 1 MB limit into the code. And he kept it a secret. Yes, Satoshi kept this change a secret until the patch was deployed, and apparently asked those who discovered the code on their own to keep quiet. He likely kept things quiet to minimize the chances that an attacker would figure out how to use an unlimited blocksize to DOS the network. Theymos puts it: ���Satoshi never used IRC, and he rarely explained his motivations for anything. In this case, he kept the change secret and told people who discovered it to keep it quiet until it was over with so that controversy or attackers wouldn't cause havok with the ongoing rule change.��� It���s also likely that Satoshi never expected the 1 MB blocksize to be a problem. At the time, the average blocksize was orders of magnitude smaller than 1 MB, and it looked like there would be time enough to devise a solution. Satoshi himself said, of the blocksize limit: ���We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it.��� And again: ���It can be phased in, like: if (blocknumber > 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete. When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.��� It���s apparent that Satoshi foresaw the removal of the blocksize limit as trivial and had no idea that such a minor code change would generate a firestorm. Bitcointalk user ���kiba��� presciently commented, shortly after the cap was created: ���If we upgrade now, we don't have to convince as much people later if the bitcoin economy continues to grow.��� In response to Satoshi���s comment that the limit could always be removed if necessary to support higher transaction capacity, Jeff Garzik pointed out: ���IMO it's a marketing thing.  It's tough to get people to buy into a system, if the network is technically incapable of supporting high transaction rates.��� Clearly the warnings were present. Many have asked why Satoshi didn���t create a larger blocksize, like 8 MB. The answer is three-fold: It wasn���t needed, as even 1 MB was far larger than the largest blocks that had ever been mined. It was technically easy to change, simply substituting one value in the code for another. Larger blocks create technical challenges. Back in 2010, Internet technology was such that larger blocks would not have propagated properly. In 2015, Theymos recalled: ���One obvious and easy-to-understand issue is that in order to be a constructive network node, you need to quickly upload new blocks to many of your 8+ peers. So 8 MB blocks would require something very roughly like (8 MB * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 15 Mbit/s upstream, which is an extraordinary upstream capacity. Since most people can't do this, the network (as it is currently designed) would fall apart from lack of upstream capacity: there wouldn't be enough total upload capacity for everyone to be able to download blocks in time, and the network would often go "out of sync" (causing stales and temporary splits in the global chain state).��� Today���s Bitcoin uses a piece of code called Segregated Witness (SegWit) to separate signatures from transaction data, effectively allowing the network to ���cheat��� by creating larger blocks than 1 MB, yet still counting them as being below the cap. SegWit also fixes a vulnerability called transaction malleability, enabling the creation of something called the lightning network. The lightning network is envisioned as a way for Bitcoin users and/or merchants to open payment channels with one another in a secure and trustless fashion. Funds can be exchanged between these parties without the transactions being written to the Blockchain. This keeps the Blockchain small, capable of being served by reasonably powerful computers. The lightning network would periodically need to ���anchor��� to the main Bitcoin Blockchain, but would allow enormous increases in transaction capacity with very small increases in the size of the Blockchain. So far there is no working implementation of lightning network on mainnet, although there are versions on test net. Lightning network will be entirely optional, and users can choose to send ordinary transactions instead, if they so choose.	1
On Saturday Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) price perked up as BTC briefly pushed above $9,700 and Ether set a 2020 high at $309.  The weekend surge comes as a bit of a surprise as weekends are typically marked by low trading volume and some traders avoid the markets due to the volatility that sometimes accompanies the weekly close.   Crypto market weekly price chart. Source: Coin360 Technicals aside, Ether���s rapid ascent to $309 could also be receiving a sentiment boost from the news that the total value of funds locked into decentralized finance platforms (DeFi) reached $4 billion today.   Total value locked (USD) in DeFi. Source: DeFi Pulse Currently, the top three DeFi platforms are Maker Aave, and Compound with each having $875 million, $639 million and $616 million locked into an assortment of contracts.  Data from DeFi Pulse shows that the decentralized finance sector has grown tremendously in 2020 as the value locked at the start of the year was slightly below $1 billion.  As discussed in a previous market update, Ether���s was expected to push toward the $317 level if the Feb. 14, 2020 high at $288.32 was cleared and Saturday���s rally to $309 fell just $8 short of topping the resistance cluster extending to $317.   Ether daily price chart. Source: Coin360 After a nearly 30% rally this week, a period of consolidation is to be expected but if bulls find renewed or Bitcoin rallies into the weekly close, there is a possibility that the price could clear $317 and the absence of overhead resistance could see bulls target the 2019 high at $367. As Ether surged to a new 2020 high, Bitcoin price pushed higher to $9,733. Traders are now watching closely to see if the top-ranked digital asset on CoinMarketCap can surge above the $9,900 level as this would place the price above the long-term descending trendline from the 2017 all-time high.  According to Cointelegraph contributor Michael van de Poppe: ���A major parabolic move is unlikely to happen so soon, as the price has some untested levels above, namely $9,900 and $10,100.���  Van de Poppe further explained that: ���The most likely scenario would be a ���staircase��� pattern where the price of Bitcoin rallies towards the resistance zone, rejects, and then successfully tests the previous resistance zone for support. Next, the price move is likely to accelerate upward once Bitcoin breaks above the high of $10,100.���  At the time of writing Bitcoin price has pulled back slightly from the daily high at $9,733 but the daily chart shows the digital asset continues to notch higher highs and high lows and the price remains above the 20-day moving average.

Litecoin (LTC) followed alongside Bitcoin with a 12.88% move to $49.47. According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $294.6 billion.

Another Bitcoin prediction was made this week by Winklevoss twins - the famous Bitcoin billionaires. Bitcoin has ���potential appreciation��� of thirty to forty times its current value, Cameron Winklevoss claimed in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Feb. 7. At press time, the market capitalization of Bitcoin was just below $140 bln, following a huge sell-off on Tuesday, Feb. 6 which has seen the cap drop as low as $102 bln. That would put the Winklevoss��� estimation of Bitcoin���s future market cap at over $5 trln. This number comes from a comparison to the $7 trln global gold market, which the brothers claim Bitcoin will disrupt. According to CNBC, the Winklevoss brothers were looking at a period of 10 to 20 years in their prediction. In response to the recent criticisms of cryptocurrencies by representatives of J.P. Morgan and the officials present at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Tyler Winklevoss argued that digital currencies will be a great instrument of machine-to-machine transactions. ���Cryptocurrencies aren't really important for human-to-human transactions ... but when machines-to-machines trade economic value, they are going to plug into protocols like bitcoin and ethereum. They are not going to open bank accounts at J.P. Morgan ... those were invented by bankers before the internet existed," Tyler stated, adding that "the criticisms are just a failure of the imagination." Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported on a number of experts who shared a similarly bullish outlook on the price of Bitcoin, predicting that it will reach $50,000 by the end of 2018, resulting in a total cryptocurrency market cap of $1 trillion.	2
The stereotypical thought of an African revolution, one that breaks the chains of oppression and domination, sparks images of bloody battles of liberation. But now, with a new tool that does not discriminate or exclude, Bitcoin is helping African millennials free himself from financial repression. Armed with only a smartphone everyday African citizens are able to tap into a growing ecosystem and profit from it. But it is more than that; businesses are looking to use Blockchain technology as a cheaper alternative in order to build a better business. In order for an individual to enter the stock market or to invest in a company or idea, it requires more than just know how. The traditional money market has been for so long an elitist environment that subtle excludes those who are not of its ilk. A thirty-something woman from the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda, does not exactly fit the bill of a savvy investor. However, Bitcoin is opening up that world to everyone and all. Peace Akware, that every 30-something from Kampala, told the BBC: "I check my Bitcoin every day and any chance I can get. Any minute, any hour, anytime, as often as I can." Merely making a living in a place like Uganda is a much harder task than on the streets of New York. Employment is a lottery even for graduates, like Peace, which leads people into looking for alternatives to make ends meet. So-called ���side hustles��� are daily bread for many in impoverished nations, but they are often unsuccessful, time-consuming, and difficult. However, Bitcoin offers an alternative which is not time-consuming, and while it comes with risks, it is accessible and manageable. There are also businesses that are challenging the difficult and cutthroat workplace by using the power of Blockchain to cut costs and time. A company called BitPesa operates like a remittance company, transferring money across borders, but instead of using a medium like the US Dollar, they have opted for Bitcoin and its simple cross-border transfers. Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of BitPesa, explains why this break with traditional banking is so effective in Africa. "I've been in Nairobi for the past month and I had three big banking things to do. All three of these operations with three different Kenyan banks were canceled for different reasons or had delays or needed additional information, so it took almost two and a half weeks per transaction to get them finalized and I'm an expert." Clearly, with the banking system, even at its best, very outdated and causing many frustrations, in Africa, where it is already flawed and alternative needs to be sought. One issue that has been brought up before with an African revolution in Blockchain and Bitcoin is educating the masses on the disruptive technology. This has prompted some to get into the business of Bitcoin education. Martin Serugga, a trader in Kampala, has started weekly classes on Bitcoin which caters to about 50 people currently. His take on it harps back to the unemployment stating that the interest comes from those who are desperately seeking and failing, at getting jobs. "If you don't have factory jobs and you don't have corporate jobs to serve the thousands of young people coming out of the universities this is an alternative.���	1
PancakeSwap, a syrupy rabbit-themed decentralized exchange that calls the Binance Smart Chain its home, has surpassed the entire Ethereum network in terms of transaction volume over a 24-hour period. Data courtesy of DappRadar shows over 2 million transactions for PancakeSwap compared with 1.55 million for Ethereum. At the same time, Binance Smart Chain reported over 6 million transactions, with roughly 20% of them occurring over the same 24-hour stretch.  The top five contributors were PancakeSwap, Mdex, Safemoon, PancakeBunny and Venus Protocol, Binance Chain Community confirmed earlier this week.  Top 5 Txs contributors1. @PancakeSwap 2. @Mdextech 3. @safemoon 4. @PancakeBunnyFin 5. @VenusProtocol https://t.co/dG3gdW3ibM Chef Hops, one of PancakeSwap���s anonymous co-founders, told Cointelegraph that user retention has been at the center of the platform���s tremendous success.  "PancakeSwap's main strength has been being lucky enough to have an insanely supportive community, in addition to low fees, and a focus on making the most user-friendly, fun experience possible,��� they said, adding: PancakeSwap is the first billion-dollar project to launch on Binance Smart Chain, which is a testament to the growth of decentralized exchanges. The price of CAKE, the platform���s native token, has skyrocketed more than 4,500% since the start of 2021. It currently trades at $28.00, having gained 17% over the past 24 hours.  Like Uniswap, PancakeSwap provides an easy entry point into the emerging world of decentralized finance. Investors looking to capitalize on volatile but potentially rewarding DeFi projects flock to these decentralized exchanges in hopes of acquiring assets before they���re listed on major exchanges.  In terms of daily volume, PancakeSwap is reportedly the third-largest decentralized exchange behind Mdex and Uniswap.  PancakeSwap recently announced that it plans to migrate to version 2 of its protocol on Friday, beginning at 5:00 am UTC. ���After the migration, PancakeSwap will stop giving out rewards for the old type of LP Tokens, and start giving rewards for the new type of LP Tokens,��� the decentralized exchange said. Users will have the opportunity to vote for one of four fee structures. Chef Hops described version 2 as a ���fridge full of goodies��� as opposed to a single product offering. That means users can expect ���new product offerings and user incentives/rewards along with adding new ingredients to some of our existing products in order to take them to the next level."	2
The views expressed here are the author���s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelgraph.com Proof of Stake (PoS) was first introduced in a paper by Sunny King and Scott Nadal in 2012 and intended to solve the problem of Bitcoin mining���s high energy consumption. At that time, it cost an average of $150,000 a day to maintain the Bitcoin network. Today, this figure is at a staggering $6.7 million (if we assume a $0.12/watt cost and multiply that with the estimated 56,209,833 KWh of electricity that the Bitcoin network consumed on Oct. 13, 2017). Rather than relying on the energy-dependent work of miners to add blocks, Sunny and Scott suggested an alternative method called ���staking��� where a deterministic algorithm would choose nodes based on the number of coins an individual had. In other words, stakers would have more chances of being selected to add a block to the chain and reap the reward if they ���staked��� more coins in their wallet.  They hoped this would avoid the ever increasing energy costs and hashrate difficulty of mining. However, their new consensus mechanism was not without its own issues.   There are four main challenges in designing a Proof of Stake system: In light of this, the evolution of PoS can be understood by each coin attempting to solve these issues in their own way.  We will now look at Peercoin.  Sunny King created Peercoin (PPC) in 2013 to become the first cryptocurrency to implement Proof of Stake while still keeping Proof of Work (PoW). It addressed the 4 issues of PoS in the following ways:  This next phase of PoS history is called considered a pure proof of stake protocol without any mining and was first implemented by NXT on November 24, 2013. However, let���s consider another coin, Blackcoin, that was also a pure proof of stake that was released shortly thereafter as it has a simpler protocol and had a fairer initial distribution phase. Blackcoin was created by Pavel Vasin (a.k.a. Rat4) and was released in February 2014.  When Rat4 decided to create BLK, he set out to remove coin age and PoW.  He believed coin age would increase the chance of a 51% stake attack as older aged coins would need less than 51% of staking coins to cause a fork. He also believed that coin age disincentivized users from staking consistently. Rather, stakers were incentivized to remain offline for 90 days to maximize their chances of getting a stake thereby making the network less secure. Rat4���s implementation of PoS v.2 protocol addresses the four issues of PoS in the following ways:  Since Blackcoin, there have been several iterations of the PoS protocol. For example, Bitshares was the first to implement Delegated Proof of Stake.  But the newest iteration of PoS is Ethereum's (ETH) attempt at PoS.  The motivation for ETH to switch is primarily a desire to move towards a more eco-friendly and decentralized system.  If the Ethereum Virtual Machine is truly to be adopted world-wide, Bitcoin���s current $6.7 million daily electricity cost would quickly be surpassed. Ethereum���s PoS system will implement a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-style PoS. Validators will be randomly assigned block rewards, however consensus is formed through a multi-round process where every validator votes for a chain. Ethereum is NOT utilizing Proof of Stake at the moment and there have been some doubts as to whether or not it will actually be implemented. With that being said, here���s how Ethereum hopes to solve the four ssues involved with PoS: There have been many fully functional and secure iterations of PoS over the history of cryptocurrency from the Hybrid PoS-PoW to pure PoS to Delegated PoS.  The BFT-style PoS is the newest attempt to address the four main issues surrounding the protocol initially proposed by Sunny and Mark. Each coin reflects a different approach and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, the move to PoS reflects a larger philosophical move in the world of cryptocurrency towards a more eco-friendly and decentralized system. *It is important to note that that PoW has its own security concerns, the topic is beyond the scope of this article.  Also, a special thanks to the Nagalim from PPC and mindphuck from to BLK for their insight.  Also thanks to Michael Gubik for his write up on Github. **The article is written by ecurrency holder, a Cryptoeducator and Community Organizer for the masses.	1
Bitcoin and altcoins have dropped up to 25% in hours after rumors the Chinese government is banning cryptocurrency exchanges once again. Comments surfacing on social media link to local media outlet Caixin, which suggests regulators are seeking a shutdown of exchanges as part of the ICO ban imposed earlier this week. Markets have reacted sharply, Bitcoin losing over 8% to head towards $4200 from $4670, while Litecoin fell 15% and others followed. NEO, the Chinese ICO project especially affected by regulatory upheaval, lost 25%.  While little evidence has appeared to support a full ban on trading, even under this eventuality, Chinese authorities are repeating behavior already seen once in 2017. January���s several-month exchange ban lasted until May, when new guidelines came into effect allowing trading to resume. As such, the knee-jerk reaction seen Friday is already being labeled ���FUD��� by some commentators. Do you hear that? That's the sound of a thousand Chinese government officials' low-ball buy orders getting filled $btc#Bitcoin politics   That's it, I'm banning China and the PBOC from #Bitcoin and $Crypto in general. Prices had recovered through this week after the impact of China���s ICO ban waned in record time. From lows of $4008 Monday, Bitcoin regained all its lost ground, only to lose half of it once again as of press time.	0
Cointelegraph would like to offer you a non-exhaustive, but attentively collected list of reading - recommendations from those thought-leaders, whom we admire, and some editorial favorites. Brock Pierce, David Orban, Wang Binsheng and others contributed to this top-20 list, which includes works related to the crypto and Blockchain issues, but also those that could be useful as an inspirational tool for venture businessmen and women, fans of innovations and fintech dreamers. Reading is always a source for thinking and feeling, while thoughts and emotions are the base of creating. So we wish you always find time in the new 2018 year to get creative energy out of printed, written, digital versions of novels, essays, interviews, etc. Enjoy the reading!   ���There is one thing, in the space, in the Blockchain space, that I recommend everyone to read. It's super easy to understand. It's written in very simple words. Each word has meaning. It's a Bitcoin paper by Satoshi Nakamoto. It's eight pages and everyone should read it!  At least the first pages. It's super easy! People think that it's not easy. People think they start the grid net and they're gonna be "Oh my god, I don���t understand anything" but it's amazingly easy to read. And that's what you need to do when you're in this space. And it���s very inspiring as well.��� - Salome Parulava, Moeco   ���First of all, I didn���t read quite a long time. I didn't really have time to read books because of all of these Blockchain developments. But recently, I realized that there's a really out of roots kind of expectation of people for cryptocurrency. But for you as an investor - to make a right decision on cryptocurrency - you need to understand the fundamental of Blockchain first. So, please, go ahead and read ���Blockchain for dummies.��� That's got to be a good starting book for people to really understand what is the under layer, technology, what is Bitcoin made of. Then, maybe, you have a better judgment -  don't just listen to anyone that Bitcoin is good or anything ever is good. You just learn about the technology first!��� - Cris Tran, QRC Group   ���It���s actually an old-school book that���s come up. It always comes up irrelevant. I���ve just finished re-reading it on a flight. It���s not a Blockchain book, it���s actually much older than that ��� it���s called ���The Mythical Man-Month��� ��� it���s an explanation and an exploration of what it takes to successfully build software. I think the author really understands the best software. We like to talk about it, I think, we like to teach it in many ways as a hard science, but the best software is really art. The code is just a medium, so rather than painting you use code to express yourself artistically through software. I think that he has a very good grasp of that nuance, but also it���s a very clear-headed approach to the fact that you���re managing, you���re working with a large number of developers, everyone with their own understanding. It can be very hard to deliver things on time, schedule��� and he talks about his lessons ��� he was one of the very first operating system designers. He had done software called OS/360 which predates us by 13 years. He had managed huge teams and, actually, he talks very frankly about his failures and lessons he learned. He knew the right way to approach building projects, so if you haven���t read that one, I highly recommend it.��� - Joshua Lavin, EOS   In this book from 1976, Friedrich Hayek advocated the establishment of competitively issued private money. According to Hayek, instead of a national government issuing a specific currency, use of which is imposed on all members of its economy by force in the form of legal tender laws, private businesses should be allowed to issue their own forms of money, deciding how to do so on their own. Recommended by Wang Binsheng, investor, advisor at Blockchain Development Organization   ���It's a recent book by super-smart guy. His name is Dave Birch. I love the author: his talks and his books, he helped me. He has written several books and they're all amazing. The previous book was called "Identity the New Money" - full of insights, very inspirational, so I recommend it!��� - Salome Parulava, Moeco   ���A book called Stealing Fire is the one I would recommend right now. <...> Hopefully, we���re not spending too much time dwelling on the past. We can learn from the past, but the past is history. There���s no changing that and it���s the future that���s a mystery and where the fun stuff lies.��� - Brock Pierce Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency. He is a very prolific creator: among other things, for example, in 1998, he designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency called "Bit Gold," never implemented, but precursing the Bitcoin architecture. He has also developed the phrase and concept of "smart contracts." In his blog he approaches, in his own words, ���an unending variety of topics��� - economics, law, history and security.   What happens when a journalist digs into crypto using his best reporting and story-telling skills? Answer: an unusual story of Bitcoin and the rise of its technology through the eyes of the movement���s colorful central characters, including an Argentinian millionaire, a Chinese entrepreneur, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and its elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Digital Gold by The New York Times technology reporter Nathaniel Popper is one of the best introductions to Bitcoin for the wide audience. The author provides deep view into industry from outside. For those who are already in it and don���t wish to refresh history created by Satoshi Nakamoto, Gavin Andresen, Erik Vorhees, Roger Ver, and the Winklevoss Twins, this book could be given to your mom - to spare quite a lot of time of explaining what we are actually doing here. ���Actually, the one that the most impacted me was the guy named Andreas. He is actually Greek. You can search on YouTube. He is passionate about Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. And what it can bring to change the world and eliminate the trust between people and the government. Basically, corrupt this whole system by stealing your wealth, you know? What he basically suggests is stealing your wealth in a stealth mode. So you have a one thousand today, you have one thousand tomorrow - actually your wealth is still the same. But, for one thousand today you cannot buy the one thousand tomorrow's goods because of the inflation. Because they are printing money, they are stealing wealth in a stealth mode. You cannot see it, cannot complain because you have one thousand now, you have one thousand tomorrow ��� doesn't change. Basically, people don't see it but this guy, he saw the problem and explained quite well. That is what made me inspired. We should go and explore more about Blockchain and bring the services and products to the market.��� - Woanjen Tang, Orioncoin  The only person to be awarded both the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the Abel Prize, John Nash inspired a Hollywoodian movie A Beautiful Mind, that is also worth watching.The theory developed by the mathematician J. Nash became fundamental for economics, politics and management. Nash equilibrium, presented in his Princeton University dissertation basically talks about interaction of two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the others, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy. Nash's work has provided insights into the factors that govern chance and decision-making inside complex systems found in everyday life.   ���To be honest, this is maybe not so specific to Blockchain and cryptocurrency, but one of my favorite personal books��� Well, actually, I have two. The first one is ���Dealing with China��� by Henry Paulson. He was a former Goldman Sachs CEO and then-Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush. He talked about his experiences and how he did business with China ��� and this is really inspired a lot of things I���m doing. The second one would be ���One Hour in China��� book by Jeffrey Towson and Jonathan Woetzel. Jeffrey Towson is a professor at Peking University and Jonathan Woetzel is a partner at McKinsey in Shanghai. They wrote a book that condenses everything you need to know about China into one hour. It started inspiring me to write a lot about Chinese consumers. I do a lot of writings. I write for LinkedIn China, I write for Cointelegraph. Those two books formed me in what I���m trying to do.��� - John Patrick Mullin   ���I would not hesitate recommending Homo Deus by Harari which is a very well written, very crisp vision of the future and our challenges as we redefine what it means to be human in the XXI century.��� - David Orban, advisor to the Singularity University   ���Interestingly enough, I���ve been going back to Plato lately. Plato���s ���Republic��� is an ancient dialog about if we were going to make a new country, what things would we include and what things would we not include. Talking about developing new communities, I think there are a lot of applications for philosophy in Blockchain and AI. Because we���re building the future of our world, what are we going to keep and what are we not going to keep? Recently I saw an interview with Vitalik, the famous guy in the Ethereum. One of the things he loves about his job, as he said is, ���I get to apply philosophy and technology every day.��� There would be my recommendation. Go back to the classics.��� - Daniel Finn, Smartmesh ���So there's not a lot of books that I get inspired. But I do like interviews and articles from well-established, respected people. How they look at cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. So, for example, Marc Andreessen, who's the founder of Andreessen Horowitz, which is one of the number one or top in the world, did a New York Times article. I think it was around 2013. ���Why Bitcoin Matters?��� To the state, I think it's one of the best articles. I think everybody should google it. It���s still relevant! Four years later! And a few others like there's Larry Summers who used to be in the Ministry of Finance and made a wonderful speech about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and he's so knowledgeable and that's a video people should try to find. And most recently the CEO of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein. He talked about that he's not skeptic or skeptical of anything new. But he believes that there's a big opportunity in Bitcoin. So when you look at that, you know that mainstream finance will come into this space. Especially like Goldman Sachs. So it was a CNN interview of Lloyd from Goldman Sachs. And those are things and it's all small snippets. I think people should watch that.��� - Mike Kayamori, QUOINE   One of the funniest and intelligent views on futurism - the Hitchhiker���s Guide became classics for those who want to see beyond the present. The aphoristically laconic Paranoid Android, praised by Radiohead song, galaxy travelers and their nostrum - a towel, the motto for any possible situation that could happen  - ���Don���t Panic,��� famous 42-answer to the ultimate question of life. The story features won���t leave you indifferent to the space saga even if your most comfortable zone is still the earth. The novel, an adaptation of the first four parts of Adams' radio series of the same name, has inspired then a series of interpretation -- from a videogame to the famous movie in 2005.  Steve Jobs was undoubtedly one of the greatest visionaries of the century. CEO and co-founder of Apple Computer and Pixar Animation Studios already suffered from cancer at the time he addressed the graduates of the Stanford University at its 114th Commencement on June 12, 2005. In this quarter-hour speech, he managed to talk about setbacks - including death itself - as opportunities - and about dreams as the most important motivation for development. If you have not seen the address, you should definitely fill in this cultural gap, if yes - we would recommend spending time to rewatch it ���cause it is maybe the best inspirational rhetorics ever made.	1
In a Twitter thread today, billionaire investor Mark Cuban weighed in on the current state and the future of blockchain technology and investment, ultimately concluding that while there are real obstacles to adoption asset prices are increasingly reflective of real ���utility��� and ���demand,��� and that the day will eventually come when crypto is ���mature to the point we wondered how we ever lived with out.��� Cuban posted the 10-tweet thread this morning, noting that as the asset class matures prices for cryptocurrencies often are now a byproduct of current use, as opposed to speculative eventual utility.  Crypto and each implementation is evolving in real time from "what is the potential utility" to "What is the current utility and how many users does it have". Tokens/Coin prices are now less a bet on the future and more a reflection of real demand. ���Having more TPS and lower gas fees is not enough,��� he wrote, likely referring to often grandiose claims from various layer-one chains with little activity, ���There must be a CURRENT network effect and significant user growth. This is a challenge for most L1s and L2s because w few exceptions, marketing in the crypto universe is beyond awful.��� He noted that he often leaves teams ���confused��� when he asks about ���their products, sales , gross margin dollars and profits,��� but that these metrics are hugely important in what he characterized as a tremendously competitive field.  Without users what value does a blockchain or L2 solution have ? But, they still haven't figured out how to sell. They pay premiums to developers and for liquidity and validators. But invest little Marketing to attract users In addition to marketing woes, the Dallas Mavericks owner said that a lack of widespread understanding about key mechanics such as protocol governance is hampering growth. Not enough is being done, he argued, to ���emphasize the impact governance can have on platforms, and their products/services.��� Eventually, however, he believes that governance participation ��� which at its best can be a ���thing of beauty��� ��� will become standard: One crypto gets over its current phase ��� one where users need to ���be educated and products and services need to be sold and deliver on their initial promises��� ��� then digital assets ���can mature to the point we wondered how we ever lived with out.���  Cuban has been especially bullish in his comments on cryptocurrencies as of late, most notably reiterating his support for BTC and Dogecoin as payment options following disparaging remarks from fellow billionaire Elon Musk that may well have crashed markets:  We at https://t.co/VUydpLFzGh will continue to accept BTC/Eth/Doge because we know that replacing Gold as a store of value will help the environment https://t.co/bs7NvnJY8A and https://t.co/ELhbuLOBRV shrinking big bank and coin usage will benefit society and the environment https://t.co/zu08F0STEQ	2
The Binance cryptocurrency exchange is offering a $250,000 equivalent bounty on the arrest of the hackers involved in the March 7th incident, Binance stated in an announcement March 11. According to the announcement, the first person to supply the information that results in a legal arrest, in any jurisdiction, will receive the bounty in Binance Coin (BNB), which is traded and used on the Binance exchange. If there are multiple sources of information that lead to the final arrests, the bounty may be split between sources. In the statement, Binance stresses the importance of an concerted effort to address crime and unethical behavior in the crypto community: ���To ensure a safe crypto community, we can���t simply play defense. We need to actively prevent any instances of hacking before they occur, as well as follow through after-the-fact. Even though the hacking attempt against Binance on March 7th was not successful, it was clear it was a large-scale, organized effort. This needs to be addressed.��� In addition to the current bounty, Binance has allotted $10 mln in crypto reserves for future bounty awards against any hacking attempts on Binance. Per Binance���s statement, the exchange has also invited other exchanges globally to follow suit. ���Protecting your funds is and has always been our highest priority!,��� they added. Users alerted Binance to the breach in the security after observing irregular and unauthorized transaction behavior in their accounts. The exact method the hackers employed remains unclear, though some users have posited that a possible compromise of users��� API keys could explain how the hackers sidestepped Binance���s two-factor authentication system. Binance resumed trading activities the next day, March 8.	0
Renaissance Macro Research���s head of technical research Jeff deGraaf concluded it may be ���game over��� for Bitcoin (BTC) in a new analysis, CNBC reports August 9. In a note to clients, deGraaf, who has received multiple accolades for his trading insights in the past twenty years, claimed Bitcoin���s price movements suggest the largest cryptocurrency is ���permanently impaired.��� CNBC quotes deGraaf as writing that Bitcoin���s ���parabolic moves are notoriously dangerous for short-sellers,��� adding that a top normally develops with the appearance of a ���descending triangle over months, with reduced volatility and little [fanfare],��� ���Once the top is complete on the support violation, the security in question can often be considered permanently impaired or even 'game���over'. We are of course referencing Bitcoin as exhibit 'A' in today's market.��� Such a situation would become a genuine consideration if BTC/USD broke year-to-date support levels, deGraaf added. Bitcoin prices have come full circle over the past three weeks to trade around $6,359 by press time, after previously rising as high as $8,450 in late July. This time last year, Bitcoin traded at around half that figure ��� $3,400 ��� as markets began their ascent that brought Bitcoin���s price to around $20,000 in December 2017.  Meanwhile, misgivings from traditional finance sources have continued in recent months, despite increased Wall Street interest and pledges to build out Bitcoin-related infrastructure. Last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon broke silence once more to call the cryptocurrency a ���scam��� after previously saying he ���was not going to talk about��� it.	1
A survey published Feb. 15 by the German Federal Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media (Bitkom), found that almost two thirds of Germans are aware of Bitcoin (BTC). Awareness of the most popular cryptocurrency has doubled since 2016, when 36 percent of German citizens were familiar with Bitcoin, and quadrupled since 2013, Bitkom reports. According to this year���s survey, 4 percent of the 1,009 respondents actually own Bitcoin, 19 percent said that they have an idea of how to buy Bitcoin, and 72 percent stated they had no interest in the digital currency. On the economic significance of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, Bitkom CEO Bernhard Rohleder stated: "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a good example of how the digital age is able to change the financial world. This is not so much about the individual currency itself as it is about the underlying blockchain technology. It will have an impact on the whole economy.��� As reported by Bitkom���s survey, the two main reasons cited by the 72 percent of Germans who have no interest in Bitcoin are risks from high price volatility and lack of knowledge of Bitcoin���s practical use. On Monday, Feb. 12, the European Supervisory Authorities warned consumers that cryptocurrencies are ���highly risky��� assets that show ���clear signs of a pricing bubble���. Awareness of cryptocurrencies is high in Germany compared to some other countries. According to a Jan. 13  survey, more than 56 percent of Russians have heard of Bitcoin. In August 2017, Charles Xue, a Chinese-American billionaire investor, suggested that the vast majority of people in China, 70-80 percent, have never heard of Bitcoin.	2
China���s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released its official cryptocurrency ratings. The ���domestic experts��� awarded Ethereum 1st and Bitcoin 13th out of 28 places May 17. As online cryptocurrency news account cnLedger reports quoting local media outlet China Electronics News (CEN), the Chinese government���s top five cryptocurrencies begin with Ethereum, followed by Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo. 1/ Public blockchain ratings by China's ministry is out: #Ethereum ranks top of the 28 cryptos evaluated  Source (in Chinese): https://t.co/9jStIiFKcc The first tranche of ratings involved 28 cryptocurrencies, with Beijing���s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology looking to expand the series to include public blockchain projects and more crypto assets. The scheme only came to light earlier this month when the Ministry announced it at a Beijing conference. ���First-rate domestic experts and scholars��� contributed to the ratings, which they calculated on the basis of three indexes: ���technology,��� ���application��� and ���innovation.��� Ethereum scored highly across all three, giving it a lead rating which echoes its first place in Weiss��� cryptocurrency ratings from January this year. Conversely, Bitcoin appeared lacking in the ���technology��� and ���application��� fields, despite beating every other crypto asset in ���innovation.��� ���The results show that the typical representative of the second-generation blockchain technology is Ethereum's technology assessment index,��� CEN wrote. Responding on Twitter, commentators nonetheless found it difficult to understand China���s logic, the mood similar to the uproar which ensued as Weiss gave Bitcoin a ���C+.���	2
Wall Street continues to have a tenuous relationship with Blockchain technology. Large banks have recently made statements both for and against the new technology, with some companies like Bank of America already pursuing patents. Part of the struggle these financial platforms are having with Blockchain technology is the issue of privacy. The key issue for traders is to keep their positions a secret in order to keep other traders and competitors out of the loop. While Blockchain technology provides immutability, it does not provide complete security or anonymity - keys for enterprise level financial adoption. However, the ZK-Snark, or Zero Knowledge proofs recently being enabled on the Ethereum blockchain following the network���s Byzantium upgrade, represent a new way to have both anonymity and immutability on a single chain. According to Bloomberg: ���Its ability to reshape vital financial market functions like clearing and settlement has always hinged on whether banks can keep customer and proprietary data secret. Zero-knowledge proofs, a theoretical possibility for decades, are now a reality, letting transactions be verified without the need to share any of the underlying data.���	2
Stellar CTO and Ripple architect Jed McCaleb cashed out a whopping $411 million in XRP in 2020, according to an updated report from blockchain analytics account Whale Alert.  McCaleb sold 1.2 billion XRP throughout the year at an average price of $0.34 per coin ��� amassing close to half a billion dollars. The sum reportedly represents 27% of McCaleb���s XRP stash that is held in a settlement account with Ripple Labs, and marks a sharp acceleration of his sales to date. He sold roughly one billion XRP in the five years between 2014 and 2019.  We have updated our analysis of one of the most famous #XRP whales out there. You can read up on what is likely one of the most successful traders of 2020 in the article below!https://t.co/Czw3nP8bW9 By Whale Alert���s estimations, the combined value of McCaleb���s current and liquidated XRP holdings is approximately $1.2 billion, placing him high on crypto���s rich list. McCaleb also appears to have timed his sales well, with Ripple currently facing lawsuits from both the SEC and from a major investor who participated in the firm's $200 million Series C funding round in 2019. McCaleb controversially received a co-founders reward of 9.5 billion XRP when he left Ripple Labs in 2014. During the same year, McCaleb signed an agreement with Ripple Labs that limited the amount of XRP he can sell per week in order to avoid negative pressure on the market.  Despite receiving widespread criticism, McCaleb has repeatedly sought to assure investors that his selling has not impacted the price of XRP. McCaleb���s agreement with Ripple Labs comes to an end in 2023.  On Jan. 1, 2020, McCaleb received 477.7 million XRP from his settlement account with Ripple Labs. McCaleb���s associated wallet still holds 652.1 million XRP ��� worth approximately $147 million at current prices.  In the original report on McCaleb's XRP sales in February, Whale Alert warned of the potential risks associated with a single entity wielding such a significant economic influence over a project with which they are no longer involved:	2
Although Bitcoin price has struggled to recover back to its newest all-time high at $3,018, avid Bitcoin enthusiast and RT���s Keiser Report host Max Keiser has stated that a new all-time high for Bitcoin price is in sight. Keiser wrote: ���New all-time high for Bitcoin in sight. Regulators will be twiddling their thumbs at $5,000, $10,000, and beyond. Welcome to NCO (New Crypto Order).��� Wider Bitcoin adoption Bitcoin as a digital currency and digital gold is demonstrating an explosive increase in demand in various regions such as Japan and South Korea. Most recently, Japan���s largest budget hotel chain Capsule Hotel, which is popular amongst travelers and freelancers, has begun to accept Bitcoin as a payment method. Capsule Hotel���s integration of Bitcoin follows the implementation of Bitcoin by Japan���s largest budget airline Peach, the country���s most influential electronics retailer Bic Camera and the most widely utilized PoS system AirREGI. In an interview, Kagayaki Kawabata, Coincheck business development lead, shared that the Comics & Capsule Hotel Comicap will accept Bitcoin payments from its guests starting June 16. He stated: ���From Friday June 16, guests can pay with bitcoin for hotel bookings at the facility in Kyoto Shin-Kyogoku. Bitcoin payments is facilitated by Coincheck. They have decided to use Coincheck Payment experimentally for capsule hotels. They may expand the bitcoin payment to other services as well.��� Media attention More to that, mainstream media networks internationally have offered more extensive coverage of Bitcoin than ever before, even discussing the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a contender among some of the world���s largest reserve currencies. Some mainstream media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal featured Bitcoin on the front page of its newspaper for several weeks. #bitcoin on Wall Street Journal front page part 2 @alansilbert   Mainstream media starting to cover bitcoin price next to gold & USD. pic.twitter.com/bYsZmk2QFU Bitcoin price is struggling to recover beyond its previous peak and all-time high. However, Cointelegraph previously reported that Bitcoin has the tendency of breaking past its previous peak and all-time high after experiencing a minor market correction. Keiser emphasized that such a trend will continue until Bitcoin price enters the $100,000 region. Based on the adoption of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset and a digital currency, Keiser���s $5,000 to $10,000 predictions are realistic. Over the past year, within a 12-month period, Bitcoin price increased from $640 to $2,575. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin price surged by over 21 percent. An increasing number of investors and traders have started to fear the possibility of the execution of a hard fork which may lead to a split chain. Analysts and experts explain that the probability of a split chain occurring is quite low, and Bitcoin scaling discussions have seen more progress in the past few weeks than it did throughout the past six months.	2
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a report Thursday, Feb. 15 explaining the temporary suspension of trading in three companies that had made statements about acquiring cryptocurrency and ���Blockchain technology-related assets���. All three companies, Cherubim Interests (CHIT), PDX Partners (PDXP), and Victura Construction Group (VICT) have been suspended starting Feb. 16 for two weeks for investor protection purposes. The SEC trading suspension orders state that all three companies issued press releases that claim that: ���[T]he companies acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things. According to the SEC order regarding CHIT, it also announced the execution of a financing commitment to launch an initial coin offering [ICO],��� The SEC orders also state ���there are questions regarding the nature of the companies��� business operations and the value of their assets���. In late August, 2017, the SEC issued a warning to investors regarding ICOs and the potential for scams, including reasons it might suspend trading of a company ���to protect investors and the public interest���. On Jan. 22, 2018 SEC Chairman Jay Clayton warned that companies that shift their business models ���on the promise��� of Blockchain technology will face closer scrutiny from regulators.	0
March 20: the Bitcoin (BTC) price broke the $9,000 mark today after a rough start to the year in which the price decreased by nearly 70 percent from the December high of $20,000. Following the December high the BTC price has moved downward in fits and starts. On January 17, BTC price was down to $9,724, less than half of where it had been a month previously when it scraped the underside of $20,000. The month of February started with BTC dipping below $9,000 for the first time since late Nov. 2017. By February the price had sunk to just $5,922, with skeptics claiming that it could sink even lower. By late February and early March, BTC was fluctuating around the $9,000 mark, with changes spurred by news of new regulations on exchanges by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A return to prices above $9,000 would provide the confidence many traders and investors need for the BTC value to grow even further. BTC/USD 4hr chart.

San Francisco-based exchange and wallet service Coinbase announced today, Aug. 3 that it is exploring the addition of 40 new assets to its custodial service, Coinbase Custody. The blog post stresses that the crypto assets may be added ���for storage only,��� and that Coinbase will add them ���as quickly and safely as possible.��� Coinbase states that they are not currently considering the assets for trading. According to the post: ���We are making this announcement internally at Coinbase and to the public at the same time to remain transparent with our customers about support for future assets.��� Among the new assets being considered for storage are Ripple (XRP), EOS, Monero (XMR), VeChain (VEN), Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Telegram. Coinbase noted that the addition of an asset to Coinbase Custody is not indicative of whether it will be added to other Coinbase products. It also states that assets under consideration for trading must pass the GDAX Digital Asset Framework. The exchange states that customers may see public-facing APIs and other indicators that Coinbase is in the process of adding support for new digital assets. Coinbase ���...cannot commit to when or whether these assets will become available on Coinbase Custody, we will provide updates to our customers about the process and what they can expect������ Coinbase Custody launched on July 2 of this year, aiming to address the ���number one��� concern of institutional investors, namely, security. The new service purportedly utilizes a range of security measures including ���on-chain segregation of crypto assets,��� ���offline, multi-sig and geographically distributed transaction protection��� and ���robust cold storage auditing and reporting.��� The company also plans to add ���secure, segregated hot wallets.��� The recently launched custodial service is also secured through an SEC-compliant and FINRA-member independent broker-dealer, Electronic Transaction Clearing(ETC).	2
Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif has admitted a ���system glitch��� allowed customers to temporarily ���buy��� trillions of dollars worth of Bitcoin for free last week, local online journal The Asahi Shimbun reported Wednesday, Feb. 21. Zaif informed users about the glitch in a post on their site Tuesday, Jan. 20, explaining that for 18 minutes on Feb. 16 users accidentally found themselves able to ���trade��� yen for virtual currency  ��� at an exchange rate of 0 yen per coin. Asahi Shimbun reports that seven users were able to obtain crypto for ���free���, but the exchange managed to cancel all illicitly-gained transactions. Asahi Shimbun reports that one ���buyer��� made an attempt to sell 2,200 trillion yen (about $20 trillion) in Bitcoin before the problem was resolved. Zaif���s Twitter posts reveal further criticism from users, who complain about poor backend performance and lack of support. The latest difficulties comes as Zaif gains increased regulatory scrutiny in the wake of January���s $530mln hack of Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck. Despite the security lapse, Japan���s licensing system for exchanges has seen considerable popularity since an legal overhaul of the space in April 2017. Licensed members will even form part of an umbrella self-regulatory group from April this year, with details still to be ironed out, Cointelegraph recently reported. Meanwhile, technical errors on mainstream consumer interfaces are far from unheard of. In January, 2018 online retailer Overstock revealed a glitch that resulted in customers being able to choose between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as payment options, with the price figure remaining the same.	0
The risks of environmental impact because of Bitcoin mining have been widely touted, but a recent report indicates that the actual damage from Bitcoin mining may well be far less than that associated with fiat currencies and other industries. Data centers, gold mining and cash production all consume substantially more energy than Bitcoin mining. The report indicates that the annual consumption of power from Bitcoin mining is 8.27 terawatt-hours per year, more than Ireland and other small nations. Nevertheless, this number is actually only an eighth of what data centers in the US consume annually, and the global production of fiat currencies stands at 11 terawatt-hours per year. Gold mining burns a staggering 132 terawatt-hours per year. What���s more, these numbers don���t even include the massive amount spent on vaults, banks, security systems and more to keep the physical cash and precious metal safe. The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining has been widely touted, particularly by those who believe it to be a non-legitimate currency, but it appears these accusations are more fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), rather than actual facts. These reports do not take into consideration the actual costs of other types of value production, all of which consume resources. In point of fact, Bitcoin consumes less energy than its non-digital equivalents	2
Bitcoin (BTC) will not stop rising until it hits $28,000, Max Keiser believes as the largest cryptocurrency gains over 20% in a week. In a series of tweets on July 27, the famously outspoken host of the Keiser Report forecast that BTC/USD was headed for six figures after a correction period near $30,000. Keiser made the prediction as Bitcoin passed $11,200 during a day of surprises. As Cointelegraph reported, $10,000 managed to hold for longer than a matter of hours, and data indicated that this latest trip to five figures was sturdier than others in 2020. ���$28,000 is in play before we see a pullback - and then we���re heading to 6-figures,��� Keiser summarized. Well known for his optimism and heavy preference for BTC over other cryptocurrencies, Keiser further took a swipe at gold bug Peter Schiff. Schiff, who has been celebrating gold hitting all-time highs against the U.S. dollar, had previously dismissed Bitcoin���s rise. ���It���s put up or shut up for Bitcoin ��� it���s got to hold $10,000 now,��� he said during a debate with Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, Anthony Pompliano, on his YouTube channel on Sunday. Keiser had little time for this and Schiff���s other arguments, claiming that in fact, the Bitcoin skeptic was secretly regretting his choice of gold. ���Somewhere, @PeterSchiff is puking his brains out right now,��� the same tweet reads.  Bitcoin versus gold 3-month chart. Source: Skew As Cointelegraph noted on Monday, gold is part of a safe haven boom which is seeing impressive performance across assets as the U.S. dollar weakens. Another giant stimulus injection from the Federal Reserve, inflating the money supply, has combined with geopolitical tensions and the ongoing coronavirus outbreak to produce unease among investors. At press time, BTC/USD was circling $10,730 after reaching its local highs of $11,380 overnight.  For Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb, however, even flipping slightly lower levels as support would be a turning point for Bitcoin, with $10,500 formerly marking severe resistance. ���Breakout! $10,500 the level that needs to become support... then... then things get real interesting,��� he wrote on his Telegram trading channel.	2
Coinbase���s exchange GDAX has stopped trading the virtual currency Bitcoin Cash (BCH) just hours after opening order books for its newest asset. Coinbase added BCH to its platform but is currently only letting customers send and receive the cryptocurrency. The platform plans to enable buy/sell soon, depending BCH���s performance on GDAX. The exchange released a statement on Twitter last night with timestamped updates, explaining that they had paused BCH-USD trading (the only Bitcoin Cash trading pair enabled so far) at 17.22 PST due to ���significant volatility���. The exchange explained that the decision to halt trading was made ���to ensure a fair and orderly market.��� Update on #BCH trading on GDAXhttps://t.co/p3cEx0ryh7 pic.twitter.com/NyGUTVFL91 Based on data from data provider CoinMarketCap, the last quoted price of Bitcoin Cash before trading was disabled was at almost $9,000 which is an increase of over $6,000 from the current market price of $3,300. On their own Twitter, Coinbase informed users last night that they will enable buy/sell functionality for BCH in their app and web version as soon as ���there is sufficient liquidity on GDAX,��� estimating that would happen sometime today. Update on #BCH trading on GDAXhttps://t.co/p3cEx0ryh7 pic.twitter.com/NyGUTVFL91 In addition to GDAX���s official explanation for the halt in trading, one of the possible reasons behind the abrupt pause is the sudden influx of users to the exchange, which likely put a strain on the platform. This may be due to the fact that Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin -- Coinbase users who held Bitcoin when the hard fork took place in August were automatically given the equivalent in Bitcoin Cash when the platform started supporting it.  As soon as Coinbase added BCH, eager users with new capital entered the exchange���s trading platform, causing a possible strain that has forced the exchange to stop trading. Coinbase���s decision to allow the trading of Bitcoin Cash on its platform was made after months of studies and monitoring of the cryptocurrency���s market performance and other developments. Since it forked from Bitcoin in August, it has become the third-largest digital currency in terms of market capitalization.	0
In an interview with Vice, six Ethereum traders including physicists, scientists, entrepreneurs and students explained why they aren���t ready to cash out their savings stored in Ethereum���s native token, Ether.      Over the past year, within a 12-month period, the price of Ethereum���s Ether increased from $10 to $242, increasing by a staggering rate of 2,320 percent. With an initial investment of around $10,000, some Ethereum traders including Jason Pappafotis, a 37-year-old physicist based in Alabama, recorded hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit. Yet, most traders don���t intend to cash out their investments in the near future, considering the potential of the Ethereum network and the industry���s expectations for decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous organizations. Ethereum has experienced a rapid increase in value, primarily due to the emergence of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) and the initial coin offering (ICO) market. Recently, Cointelegraph reported that the ICO market crossed the $1 bln mark, officially becoming a billion dollar market on its own. Despite the lack of viable products and active user bases, ICOs are continuing to attract more investors from both the cryptocurrency community and institutional investors. Vice spoke to six early investors in Ethereum that have held Ether either since its pre-sale or since 2015. Most traders and investors in Ethereum, as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Ethereum Classic, are investing their money in digital currencies and assets to obtain a more thorough understanding of the structure, monetary policies and purposes of these cryptocurrencies. In May, multi-billion dollar investment firm Fidelity revealed that the company has been mining Ethereum and utilizing both Ethereum and Bitcoin as payments in order to grasp a better understanding of the two technologies. "We have built proofs of concepts that accept Bitcoin micro-transactions. We set up small Bitcoin and Ethereum mining operations, just done in the spirit of learning,��� said Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson. However, the vast majority of early investors have invested in Ethereum for its long-term vision of establishing an ecosystem for decentralized applications; an ecosystem that is censorship-free, transparent and fair for users, developers and stakeholders. Currently, a wider range of organizations are experimenting with the Ethereum network and its smart contract technology. Some multi-billion dollar companies within the EEA including BHP Billiton, JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft, are attempting to use smart contracts to automate certain processes and operations. When companies successfully commercialize Ethereum and its framework for decentralized applications, the Ethereum network will start to handle actual user bases. As Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam emphasized in the past, in order for Ethereum to handle one to 10 mln active users, it will need to scale by a factor of 100 times. Still, a very active development community is working to scale the Ethereum network on a daily basis and traders are considering the long-term development of Ethereum. ���A lot of people have told me to cash out. But I didn���t do it. This is only the beginning,��� an early investor in Ethereum told Vice.	1
Teen crypto star Erik Finman has said Bitcoin (BTC) ���may have a bull market or two left in it,��� but that ���long-term, it���s dead,��� in an interview with financial news site MarketWatch on Dec. 17. Finman is famous for his precocious investment in Bitcoin back in 2011, when he reportedly bought in ��� at the age of twelve ��� at $12 a coin. The high schooler���s $1,000 gift from his grandmother thus became over $4 million during the cryptocurrency���s 2017 all-time price highs. Finman sealed further fame by notoriously winning a bet with his parents that if he became a crypto millionaire before the age of 18, he could opt out of going to college. In his interview with MarketWatch, the still-teenage Finman remarked, ���Bitcoin is dead, it���s too fragmented, there���s tons of infighting I just don���t think it will last.��� He gave a similarly grim forecast for Litecoin (LTC), the altcoin founded by Charlie Lee: ���Litecoin has been dead for a while. It���s like when the sun is going down and there���s that eight minute period just before it goes dark. Litecoin is in its seventh minute.��� More optimism went to ���project-based��� coins such as Ethereum (ETH) and anonymity-oriented token Zcash (ZEC), with Finman reserving positive comments for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ��� notwithstanding its recent controversial hard fork ��� affirming his belief in the coin���s technology. The teen also reportedly railed against ���the hooks and lobbyists��� of Wall Street; buoyed by his early success, he told MarketWatch, ���I���m better at this kind of stuff than those millionaires. [...] They don���t know how to work the system, they���re nerds. I���m more than that.��� According to Cointelegraph���s price indexes, as of press time Bitcoin is trading at $3,611 ��� up 10 percent on the day but down more than 36 percent on the month. Litecoin is up over 16 percent on the day to trade at $30 but has shed over 30 percent in value on its monthly chart. As previously reported, Finman���s quirks include allegedly going to Mexico to safely stash away the hard disk with the private keys to his crypto wallets ��� in the vein of characters from the popular TV series Breaking Bad. He has also spoken of plans to purchase a Lamborghini with a personalized license plate corresponding to his average grade point in high school ��� 2.1 ��� although he never graduated.	0
There���s been some panic lately over the various ���forks��� of the Bitcoin network, particularly among the less tech-savvy who hear inaccurate or incomplete news on the mainstream media. It���s important to clear up some confusion, because there are more so-called ���forks��� coming. First, the most important thing to know is this: there will only ever be 21 mln Bitcoin in existence. Period. End of story. There have been and will continue to be currencies that fork from the Bitcoin network, taking with them a full snapshot of the network up until that point. Yet there���s still only one Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin-anything-else, none of them have interoperability with the real Bitcoin network. Bitcoin skeptics have been telling people that with the Bitcoin Cash fork, there will now be 42 mln Bitcoin in existence. It won���t be long before they start claiming that with the upcoming Bitcoin Gold fork, there will ultimately be 63 mln coins in existence. This is complete falsehood. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold cannot be spent on the Bitcoin network. As far as Bitcoin���s network is concerned, they are merely altcoins like Litecoin, Dash, and so on. They are not Bitcoin and cannot make the argument that they are. There is only one Bitcoin, and there will only ever be 21 mln coins on that network. Many less sophisticated investors get worried every time they hear about an upcoming fork. Calm down: there���s nothing wrong with a fork. Bitcoin and numerous altcoins have successfully forked countless times over the years with no ill effects. In fact, the currency Dash executes a carefully staged hard fork (called the ���spork���) every time it does a protocol upgrade. None of these forks have ever caused a chain split. There are two types of forks: soft forks and hard forks. Soft forks are backwards-compatible, meaning that upgraded nodes can use the new features, while old nodes will still function but won���t have the new capabilities. Bitcoin���s recent SegWit upgrade is a great example of a soft fork. With SegWit, not all nodes were required to upgrade their software. Anybody who doesn���t want to use SegWit���s features (namely, lower fees) is free to continue using their older version of the Bitcoin client. It will still work just fine. A hard fork is the exact opposite: all nodes must upgrade. Any node that doesn���t upgrade will simply not work anymore. The real danger is this: soft forks are reversible, because following the new rules is optional. Hard forks are not reversible, and any bug in the code or unanticipated behavior on the network can only be fixed by issuing another hard fork. This can lead quickly down a deep rabbit hole. The worst-case scenario in a hard fork situation is a chain split. A chain split occurs when a hard fork goes poorly and the network itself splits in two. Part of the network follows one set of rules, while the other part follows another set of rules. Chain splits are incredibly dangerous and essentially make the network unusable until the split is resolved by another hard fork. With a network and economy as large as Bitcoin���s, it would be extremely difficult to execute a follow-on hard fork to fix a chain split. A bad enough chain split could literally kill Bitcoin. When it became obvious the SegWit solution was going to be the winner in Bitcoin���s civil war, a group of disgruntled developers decided to create an alternate version of Bitcoin. This version, called Bitcoin Cash, would keep Bitcoin���s entire transaction history and all of its rules and structures. Only three things would be changed: the 1 MB blocksize limit would be increased, the SegWit code would be removed, and an ���emergency difficulty adjustment��� (EDA) was added. Due to the nature of the fork, everybody who owned Bitcoin now owned an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. Yet the two networks did not directly compete with one another. For one, Bitcoin Cash added a feature called ���replay protection,��� which prevented transactions on one network from affecting the other network. Another reason for the lack of direct competition is because virtually all Bitcoin���s miners continued to mine Bitcoin, except for a few hours here and there when they were able to exploit Bitcoin Cash���s EDA for greater profits. Most Bitcoin owners, finding themselves flush with Bitcoin Cash, either sold the new currency or completely ignored it. There was never any danger of Bitcoin Cash replacing Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin Cash was probably a good thing in the long run, because it removed discontents from the Bitcoin community by giving them their own altcoin to run. Bitcoin Gold is an upcoming fork of Bitcoin that will occur on or around Oct. 25, 2017. As with Bitcoin Cash, when the fork officially occurs, Bitcoin owners will also possess an equal number of Bitcoin Gold coins. As with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin owners who find themselves in possession of Bitcoin Gold may either do nothing and keep the new coins, or may sell them and potentially increase their stash of Bitcoin (assuming the new coin is worth anything). Just as with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold will be an altcoin. Bitcoin Gold will feature replay protection as well, and since virtually no miners will leave the Bitcoin network to mine Bitcoin Gold, it will not threaten Bitcoin���s network in any way. There is zero chance that Bitcoin Gold will ���take over��� or ���kill��� the main Bitcoin chain. Bitcoin Gold is a protest of the growing power and centralization of miners. Bitcoin miners continue to use more and more powerful specialized ASIC computers to mine Bitcoin. These ASICs are extremely expensive and benefit greatly from economies of scale, resulting in greater centralization on the Bitcoin network. At present, a handful of miners (or mining pools) control the majority of Bitcoin���s mining power. Bitcoin Gold will be changing the consensus rules for its new network by using a different algorithm for mining. This change in algorithm will keep ASICs from working, resulting in miners using easier-to-obtain GPUs. This change is expected to decrease miner centralization on the Bitcoin Gold network. Again, it should be emphasized that Bitcoin Gold will not affect Bitcoin in any way. Bitcoin Gold will be an altcoin, with its own network and its own rules. While Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are technically forks of Bitcoin, they don���t affect Bitcoin���s network in any way. They are not a threat in any way. They simply use (most of) Bitcoin���s code, and they distribute their currency proportionally to all Bitcoin holders. Considering that the term ���fork��� is usually associated with an attempt to upgrade a network, using that word to describe Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold tends to get quite confusing for novices. A better word might be ���airdrop.��� An airdrop is a means of distributing the initial supply of coins when an altcoin is created. Byteball is a great example; users link their Byteball address to their Bitcoin address(es), and at certain times, they receive a number of Byteball tokens proportional to their Bitcoin ownership. Given that the only thing Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are using the Bitcoin Blockchain for is initial token distribution, they really act more like airdrops than forks. Don���t worry. None of these forks in any way harm the Bitcoin network. They aren���t increasing Bitcoin���s supply. How could they? They aren���t Bitcoin!	1
Two Italian 17-year-olds were arrested for paying Bitcoin (BTC) to see children being sexually abused, tortured and murdered in live streaming. Local media Il Messaggero reported on July 15 that the deep web website viewed by the two also allowed users to pay extra to decide what torture the children would be subjected to next. Italian law enforcement explained: ���Users that were able to reach those kinds of obscure environments are allowed to take part in acts of sexual violence and torture on minors, performed live by adults.��� The services offered by the website have different costs. Viewing a pre-recorded video costs much less than watching live, but in both cases the viewing concludes with the death of the child. The article also provides another example, according to which ���viewers can for instance request them to amputate a children���s arm or to pour hot oil over the victim.��� Law enforcement said: ���The live requests really cost a lot of money and ensure particularly high profits to the foreign organizations that carry out those inhuman acts.��� The two were searched as part of an ongoing investigation that has so far involved 25 people ��� 19 minors and six over 18 ��� residing in 13 Italian provinces. The operation is nicknamed ���Delirio��� ��� delirium in Italian ��� by local law enforcement. It started in October and resulted in tens of searches. The two arrested are a man and a woman who exchanged details pertaining to what they referred to as a ���red room.��� The man often shared with the women grim details of the livestreams. Media found include pedopornographic videos self-made by minors, videos of children as young as three-year-olds being molested by adults, and videos depicting violence often accompanied by Nazi symbology. It is unclear whether the website offering the services was shut down, but presumably only some of its viewers were caught. Local law enforcement has not answered Cointelegraph���s inquiry. Cryptocurrencies��� pseudonymity and the lack of governmental control over them make them suitable for criminals. Among such criminals, we can find political dissidents, whistleblowers and journalists, but also pedophiles, drug dealers and black-hat hackers. There have been many worldwide reports on the use of Bitcoin and other crypto assets specifically in child porn dealings. For instance, at the end of June Spanish law enforcement took down a dark-web child porn ring that used cryptocurrency transactions to pay for content.	0
The cryptocurrency world is in a fuss about Bitcoin and rightly so, with the cancellation of the SegWit2x hardfork and the sudden drop in pricing by nearly $1000 per BTC. However, the price drops and news has kept Bitcoin in the limelight while Ethereum has slowly been making improvements and growing its network. The second largest market cap coin has seen substantial use cases arise as the ICO world continues to flourish and new ERC20 and ERC223 tokens are created. Recent reports by the Ethereum Foundation indicate that Ethereum processed 44 percent more transactions than the Bitcoin Blockchain, showing the power of the Ethereum system. Further, the total number of pending transactions for Ethereum has been stable between 30 and 300, while the same figure for Bitcoin has fluctuated anywhere from 39,000 to 47,000. The ZK-SNARK protocol, released on the Ethereum platform with the Byzantium hardfork, was quickly criticized by some tech insiders because of its risk of attack from quantum computers. While some had posited that the Ethereum fork would produce a Wall Street adoption boom, the risk from quantum computers has kept adoption steady. A recent paper by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin indicates, however, that a new protocol called the ZK-STARK has been conceptualized in order to protect a full zero-knowledge transaction, even from quantum computing. This protocol relies only on hashes and information theory, rather than the ���trusted setup��� of its ZK-SNARK cousin. The upgraded anonymity, while perhaps necessary for such applications as public or fiscal Blockchain transactions, does come at a data cost - from 288 bytes to a few hundred kilobytes according to Buterin. However, in fields where anonymity is paramount, the additional data would provide something that no other system to date can accomplish - fully secure and fully anonymous transactions. With the rise in transaction volume, the increased speed of transactions, and burgeoning technology use cases, Ethereum may be poised for greater market growth in the coming months.	2
A week ago, Ethereum���s market cap reached 50 percent of Bitcoin���s. On June 12, Ethereum price reached $396, moving closer to Bitcoin���s current market cap of $46 bln. The Flippening is almost here! https://t.co/tr0jCGuev2 pic.twitter.com/xr8ZU26qz2 The cryptocurrency industry, market and community are anticipating the ���flipenning��� or the possibility of Ethereum surpassing the market of Bitcoin. It is approximately $10 bln away from reaching the market of Bitcoin. Before speculating on the possibility of Ethereum becoming the most dominant Blockchain network, it is important to consider whether its recent price rally can be justified. Has Ethereum demonstrated commercial success? Are actual users utilizing Ethereum to access decentralized applications? Or is it a completely speculative investment and not-so-smart money flowing into the market? Objectively, Ethereum���s recent price rally has been mostly speculative. The vast majority of investors in South Korea, the largest Ethereum exchange market, do not have sufficient knowledge of the purpose, structure, technical intricacies and philosophy of the Ethereum network. Most investors can���t seem to differentiate Ethereum from Bitcoin when the two Blockchain networks fundamentally oppose each other in many ways. Charlie Shrem, the COO of Jaxx, wrote: ���ETH is rising because new users want to "get rich quick with ICO's". They don't care about the ETH price, and they arent holding. All the supply gets locked by the ICO's in the contract. They won't sell because the price is rising. Demand grows, supply is reduced.��� Ethereum���s native token Ether was designed to be used as gas. It isn���t a cryptocurrency or a store of value, unlike other altcoins such as Ethereum Classic that have a fixed supply. Ethereum is based on an inflationary supply to ensure that the network is fueled by Ether, also referred to as gas, within the network. Hence, investors purchasing Ether to utilize it as a currency because it settles much faster than Bitcoin transactions have failed to understand the purpose of Ether. Most investors have purchased Ether due to their overall enthusiasm and optimism toward the network. Very few investors have purchased Ether to participate in ICOs, to use it as a currency or to use it as gas to fuel decentralized applications. It is difficult to justify that the money flowing into the Ethereum market is not speculative because of major markets such as South Korea. In a recent interview, Vitalik Buterin emphasized that he had no idea why South Korea is the largest Ethereum exchange market. He noted that he is aware of the active Ethereum development community within China led by various consortia, educational institutions and conglomerates. South Korea, in contrast, is simply the largest Ethereum exchange market because people are speculating on the value of Ethereum. Over the past year, Ethereum has introduced a phenomenal method of raising investments for startups and companies called ICO. By offering unique tokens that are compatible with the Ethereum network and its token Ether, companies can raise capital without the involvement of intermediaries and mediators. However, as prominent Bitcoin trader and cryptocurrency analyst WhalePanda noted in his blog post, the major factor that led Ethereum���s market cap to surge is the rising popularity of ICOs. He noted: ���I do admit I didn���t see this Ethereum bubble coming, but then again I wrongly assumed that no startup would need or even dare to ask $50 million in funding and I also wrongly assumed that people would use common sense and that leading developers would speak out against this sort of practice. Quite the opposite it seems. Ethereum���s sole use case at the moment is ICOs and token creation.��� Evidently, ICOs are not the only sole use case of Ethereum. However, its recent price surge has been solely attributed to the growth of ICOs and the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Ethereum offers an infrastructure and a level of flexibility which Bitcoin simply doesn���t. On the other hand, Bitcoin offers a store of value and a settlement network that is secure and that was designed to operate as money, down to its monetary supply. Even if Ethereum���s market cap surpasses that of Bitcoin, investors shouldn���t consider Ethereum as a superior Blockchain network over Bitcoin. Vice versa, Bitcoin investors shouldn���t dismiss Ethereum because of its smaller market cap. The two Blockchain networks obviously offer features and infrastructures that are unique and are sought out by the market.	2
Starbucks has clarified that it will not be accepting Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies as payment, despite misleading reports from mainstream media, a spokesperson told Motherboard Friday, August 3. Earlier on Friday, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) operator the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announced plans to create a new ���global platform and ecosystem for digital assets,��� dubbed ���Bakkt,��� alongside a group of big name enterprises including Starbucks, BCG and Microsoft. Following the major announcement, a number of mainstream media outlets, including Bloomberg and CNBC, ran misleading headlines ������ such as CNBC���s ���New Starbucks partnership with Microsoft allows customers to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin��� ������ directly implying that the partnership would mean customers could purchase items at Starbucks for crypto. A spokesperson for the multinational coffee chain clarified in comments to Motherboard that in fact ���customers will not be able to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin,��� but rather the company is part of a new venture creating a platform, Bakkt, to ���convert digital assets like Bitcoin into U.S. dollars, which can be used at Starbucks,��� adding: ���At the current time, we are announcing the launch of trading and conversion of Bitcoin. However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves.��� Starbucks��� official press release Friday elaborated on the project, stating that it would, pending regulation, include physically delivered Bitcoin futures: ���As an initial component of the Bakkt offering, Intercontinental Exchange���s U.S.-based futures exchange and clearing house plan to launch a 1-day physically delivered Bitcoin contract along with physical warehousing in November 2018, subject to CFTC review and approval.��� In May, the New York Times reported on sources suggesting the ICE was considering launching physically-delivered BTC futures contracts, a move Friday���s news confirms. In late July, former Wall Street exec turned crypto entrepreneur stated crypto markets ���need a trusted, name custodian ��� a Japanese bank or HSBC or ICE or Goldman Sachs ��� to allow institutional investors to feel comfortable.���	0
The head of the United States Federal Reserve has admitted current economic policy is ���not sustainable��� ��� but that it is not its job to fix it. Speaking during testimony before Congress��� Joint Economic Committee on Nov. 13, Jerome Powell noted that currently, U.S. national debt is growing faster than nominal GDP. ���Ultimately in the long run that���s not a sustainable place to be,��� he said. Powell continued: ���How to fix that ��� it���s easy to say that ��� how do you do that and when do you do that is an issue that is up to you and not to us.��� As Cointelegraph reported, U.S. debt has now topped $23 trillion ��� around $70,000 per head of the population, or more than $1 million for each Bitcoin that will ever exist. On the night of Nov. 14 alone, the Fed distributed funds to banks worth 12.7 million BTC, while its balance sheet is expanding towards $4 trillion. For Powell, however, resolving the debt crisis simply means making growth beat debt, and even failure to do so would not equal chaos. ���I would be remiss in not pointing out that the consequences of not addressing it is just that��� our kids and grandkids will be spending their tax dollars servicing debt rather than on the things they really need,��� he continued.  The comments came as U.S. president Donald Trump renewed calls for negative interest rates ��� effectively charging savers to store fiat currency ��� and criticized the Fed for not introducing them. ���Remember, we are competing with nations who openly cut interest rates so that now many are actually getting paid when they pay off their loan��� who ever heard of such a thing? Give me some of that, give me some of that money,��� he said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. Debt-driven economic policy and its consequences were the main motivation behind Bitcoin (BTC), which appeared after the 2008 economic crisis.  As hard money with a deflationary supply impossible to manipulate, Bitcoin is increasingly compared to gold as a hedge against the constant erosion in the value of fiat currencies.	1
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has asked all 10 countries in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) to work together on the creation of the Petro, his proposed oil-backed cryptocurrency, according to local sources. During a meeting of ALBA on Jan. 12, Maduro had announced: ���I put it on the table, brother governments of the ALBA, the proposal of the cryptocurrency of the Petro, so that we can take it on as one of the projects of integration of the 21st century in a bold way, but also in the manner of a creator and a creative.��� Maduro declared his intention to create the Petro in early December, and on Jan. 6 he ordered the issuance of the first 100 mln petros, each backed by one barrel of oil. The president has already set aside 5 mln barrels of Venezuelan oil in preparation, with the currency set to launch in 6 weeks in the form of an auction, as it will be pre-mined. However, on Jan. 9, the Venezuelan parliament declared the Petro an illegal currency. The parliament has stood in opposition to President Maduro since his Socialist Party lost its majority in 2016, and has been vocal against what they see as a fraudulent currency. Parliament Deputy Williams D��vila said, according to newspaper El Universal, that the Petro���s creations only serves to: ���Evade financial sanctions, [and is] openly violating the Constitution, and legitimizing illicit transactions.��� Venezuela, a country facing both hyperinflation and EU and US sanctions, has seen a massive amount of Bitcoin use among its population, which is choosing to use digital currency over the failing government-issued Bolivar. Some see the high volume of Bitcoin use in Venezuela as the start of one of the first ���Bitcoinizations��� of a sovereign state. While the upcoming launch of the Petro is uncertain due its tenuous political context, the idea of using cryptocurrency for oil trading had come up before in 2016, when the strained relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia caused alarm over oil market stability.	2
Recently, the Blockchain craze has soared to new heights, as people are talking about using Blockchain for just about everything. This ���everything Blockchain��� phenomenon is leading to some interesting use cases. Even lawmakers are taking notice of Blockchain, talking with crypto enthusiasts to find common ground. The amount of money raised on the Blockchain, by means of ICOs, has already exceeded $1.2 bln year-to-date. This year���s The Times Higher Education World University Rankings, endorsed by accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCooper as ���the only global university rankings subjected to full, independent scrutiny of this nature,��� has seen 13 top global universities already having added Blockchain education to their curricula. Still, while Blockchain has been nearly universally acknowledged as ���The Next Big Thing��� its real world adoption has been slow and cumbersome. Even the original app of Blockchain--Bitcoin--has experienced slow uptake in the conservative and highly regulated banking and finance sectors. Although Bitcoin fueled industry development several years ago, Blockchain is now being used in numerous different areas. For the moment, Bitcoin remains a speculative currency, often saddled with the ���bad boy��� reputation that comes from being the primary source of financing on the darkweb. Bitcoin continues to evoke scrutiny from largely confused regulators and law enforcement agencies, whilst remaining a ���black box��� phenomenon for common folk and the majority of traditional market players. However, there is a silver lining for wide-scale Blockchain adoption. Throughout the last months, US health care providers started to slowly implement Blockchain for securing patients��� records and storing medical imaging. In Europe, Blockchain is viewed as an aid to wholesale energy traders. The US logistics and trucking industry is seriously considering Blockchain as a cure-all for the industry���s common hurdles. Blockchain advocates root for the technology, which is expected to provide benefits like immediate payments to drivers upon delivery of cargo, self-directing fuel and maintenance payments, complete automated settlements, and recording and improving accessibility of carrier history and safety. The newly established Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA), a Blockchain-inspired think tank of transportation industry players, sees its purpose as promoting and educating the industry on Blockchain, contributing to common standards development, and encouraging the use of Blockchain industry. Recently, IBM announced its cooperation with 10 major US food suppliers in an effort to find areas of improvement in the global supply chain with help of Blockchain. With industry giants like Nestle, Unilever and Walmart on board, the collaboration is destined to benefit consumer and vendors on all levels, with Blockchain enabling sellers to enjoy tremendous savings through optimization of the supply chain. Use of Blockchain in this context will also ensure greater public safety standards to consumers, as the technology will enable food suppliers to quickly identify the source of foodborne outbreaks. The challenge of bringing Blockchain into the world of retail, transportation or cargo delivery became a founding principle of a project called Universa. Its founder, Alexander Borodich, is positive the protocol will become a driver behind real-life implementation of Blockchain and help the technology fulfill its advertised potential. He explains to Cointelegraph: ���During my early years at the university, I read about Yap stones, which served as equivalent of money in Micronesia. They were very heavy and almost impossible to move anywhere, which made the community use them for meetings where the members would emboss each new owner���s name right on the stone. Later, I saw a striking similarity in the concept of Bitcoin: the registry is being updated to reflect ownership changes of the network and who it belongs to. In other words, the idea of Blockchain usage was born a long time ago, but in our project we have decided to accumulate all the advantages of data decentralization and want to get rid of the disadvantages of Bitcoin and Ethereum.��� According to Borodich, Universa was conceived as a ���smart��� contracting and payment means for ���everything Blockchain.��� It operates via a decentralized system of smart contracts or applications with electronic certification that closely resembles the traditional creation of paper documents. Borodich is optimistic about the potential of Blockchain���s use in trucking: ���Imagine an immediate [Blockchain] use case that we [have] in mind: the RFID label is equipped with a ���smart seal,��� which lets it be immediately recognized by the cargo terminal, notifies the user in question with an alert containing the cargo description and all necessary details securely.��� Among other use cases, there are various spheres of application, traditionally associated with exchange of papers and signatures. Those can vary from the purchase of a piece of an intellectual property to notary verification of deals.	2
The global cryptocurrency community was panic stricken for the most part of the past week. A depression that has been nicknamed by Cointelegraph as the "crypto massacre" saw almost every virtual currency bleeding profusely. It was a doomsday of sorts, and many attributed the gloom to a couple of issues. Some said the Bitcoin scaling debate was to blame for the mass slump of cryptos. Another theory attributed it to DDoS attacks currently affecting Bitcoin exchanges. But towards the end of the week, a ray of hope appeared, with various digital currencies emerging from the ashes and appreciating in value. It was fantastic to observe the speedy recovery of these cryptocurrencies, with some making admirable gains while others are yet to recover from their losses. Early in the week, it was IOTA who caused an upset by invading the top 10 and taking over the sixth spot. The move ensured that Monero and Bytecoin parted ways with the elite top 10. It also resulted in BitShares and Stratis being pushed down the ladder. They now occupy the ninth and tenth positions respectively. It was a major shake up that indeed caused some mayhem. But the IOTA rampage capsized when the only exchange that has listed it so far endured a DDoS attack. This saw the newcomer being pushed to the eighth position. However, the most intriguing movement came with Litecoin. In fact, the SegWit pacesetter jumped three places to be the world's number four crypto on Saturday. In the process, it pushed aside IOTA, NEM and Ethereum Classic, when just last Wednesday it was ranked seventh. At the time writing on Sunday morning, LTC was being sold for $43.12 and its market cap has surpassed the $2 bln mark. In the past few weeks, the currency has gone through a metamorphosis. First, they successfully activated SegWit and statements from the team indicated that there has yet to be a blemish. Then, the Chinese government lifted its ban on the withdrawal of Litecoin and Satoshis at exchanges. Finally, the community became aware with bliss of Charlie Lee's resignation from Coinbase to concentrate fully on his brainchild.	2
Popular Ethereum wallet interface MyEtherWallet (MEW) has released a unexpected alternative product, MyCrypto.com, one of MEW���s original developers announced in a blog post Feb. 9. MEW has become one of the most popular Ethereum and ERC20 token storage management tools over the past year, and will continue to exist along with a new project, which has an almost identical interface. In the blog post, one of MEW���s original developers Taylor Monahan gave a brief history of the project and the impetus behind her creating MyCrypto, while remaining silent on relations between herself and her fellow co-developer of MEW, known as Kvhnuke. ���MyEtherWallet LLC was sufficient for the early stages of growth. MyCrypto is designed with next-level scaling in mind from the beginning,��� Monahan explained in the post, adding she had spent nine months assembling a team to oversee all operations. She also added: ���Kvhnuke remains in control of the MEW github repository, the MEW domain, the AWS instances, and the MyEtherWallet social media accounts.��� MEW���s structure has allowed it to avoid the common pitfalls ���true��� wallet providers have struggled with increasingly as cryptocurrency has gained value and an influx of new users. Ostensibly designed to serve even more users via a similar setup, MyCrypto will enter public beta testing in the near future, Monahan nonetheless stating she was ���terrified��� about the road ahead. She continued: ���I was terrified ��� am terrified ��� at the potential harm this change will have on myself, the team, and/or the Ethereum community but ultimately, the risks created by continuing down the road we were on are greater than the risks of splitting to a new brand, new company, new name, and new domain. While contemplating this decision, I began to see that my inaction would be the only thing that guaranteed my failure.��� Online, the circumstances surrounding the changes continue to cause suspicion and confusion among users. MyEtherWallet's abrupt change in branding to MyCrypto should have been announced using MyEtherWallet's social media accounts first. This is a very amateurish way of handling it. This is coming from an everyday user of MEW and its biggest fan. While MEW has not yet published any comment about the new brand, curious statements about what staff describe as an ���unlawful social media account switch��� on Twitter have coincided with the release of the MyCrypto news.	2
An online community user going by the online alias gingerbreadfutters who has an undisclosed terminal disease, recently purchased $325,000 worth of Bitcoin as the digital currency achieved a new all-time high at $1,700. Bitcoin price has increased significantly since then, reaching $1,866 as a global average across major markets on May 11. However, users in the online community wherein ginerbreadfutters made his announcement harshly criticized his decision to all in on Bitcoin after they discovered that he obtained the capital through a loan. To be specific, gingerbreadfutters acquired an equity loan of $325,239 on his house in order to purchase 191 Bitcoins. He stated: ���I decided to make my newest lunge, using what equity I have accrued on my estate over the past 10 years since the 2008 financial crisis. If Bitcoin reaches the 10k mark ��� which I see as a distinct possibility, or I would not have taken such a risk ��� I plan on moving to the West Coast and getting away from all the angry people here where I currently reside.��� An equity loan is a type of loan in which the equity of the borrower���s home is used as collateral. In other words, gingerbreadfutters is gambling on his life savings that is his real estate and betting yet another $325,000 obtained by using his life savings as collateral to make a mid-term profit on Bitcoin. More to that, gingerbreadfutters told his online community that he plans to sell all of his Bitcoins once Bitcoin price hits $10,000 and purchase new real estate on the west coast. However, the community criticized gingerbreadfutters��� extremely risky and frankly foolish investment strategy. Investors should always prevent from initiating risky investments for short and mid-term profit because there are potential situations wherein investors may be in urgent need of capital but their assets or money are locked up. Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset, investment and currency to posses. But, if gingerbreadfutters makes a slight mistake in his calculations and plans and risk his life savings, the entire mid-term Bitcoin investment strategy could end up as a disaster. Another online community user with the alias Dispairsquid16 efficiently analyzed gingerbreadfutters��� situation and investment mindset with an analogy: ���Almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.��� Gingerbreadfutters realized that he will not be able to live a long life due to an undisclosed terminal disease and thus, acknowledging that he has little to lose, he gambled his life savings and a massive debt obtained using his life savings as collateral to investment in Bitcoin. For any potential investors planning on investing in Bitcoin, it is an extremely risky approach to gamble a large amount of money on Bitcoin���s short and mid-term price trend.	1
June 22 ��� bitcoin (BTC) has crossed the $11,000 line for the first time since March last year today, according to Coin360. The leading cryptocurrency had surged past the $10,000 mark less than 24 hours ago.  Market visualization courtesy of Coin360 Bitcoin is currently already approaching $11,100, up a notable almost 13 percent in the past 24 hours to press time. Meanwhile, major alts have also surged, with ETH seeing a multi-month high over $300.  Bitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Coin360 Yesterday, on June 21, professional trader Peter Brandt tweeted that bitcoin���s price is currently taking aim at $100,000 target. In his tweet, Brandt noted that bitcoin is on its fourth parabolic growth phase and is a market like no other: ���Bitcoin takes aim at $100,000 target. $btcusd is experiencing its fourth parabolic phase dating back to 2010. No other market in my 45 years of trading has gone parabolic on a log chart in this manner. Bitcoin is a market like no other.��� Attached to the tweet, Brandt also published a table containing data about the price growth of bitcoin. According to the data contained in the image, from October 2011 to December 2017, bitcoin increased its value 9,765-fold. Among the responses to the post there are numerous scam attempts, publicizing fake BTC and ETH giveaways from Brandt. At least one of the scams is promoted through verified Twitter profiles. In late May, the co-founder of blockchain investment firm Kenetic predicted that the price of bitcoin will rally as high as $30,000 by the end of this year. Earlier this month, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group argued that it ���looks like, perhaps, we are coming out of a crypto winter and we���ve entered a crypto spring,��� in an interview with Bloomberg. However, in an interview with Cointelegraph the same week, another industry commentator ��� ex-Wall Street executive and current blockchain researcher Tone Vays expressed skepticism about the fact that crypto winter is over. Earlier this week, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab released the results of a survey showing that 19% of people globally have purchased cryptocurrency.	2
Every Friday, Law Decoded delivers analysis on the week���s critical stories in the realms of policy, regulation and law. ���It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,��� begins the most famous English-language story of the French Revolution. Though many would disagree with me, I would argue that neither is true of today. Maybe that���s why what passes for revolutions these days is so dependent on memes and lunatic viral conspiracy theories. That same memetic energy has brought together an unholy matrimony of anarchists, leftists, populists, jilted investment bros, Boogie boys and survivalists, AOC stans, and a dose of antisemitism ��� the sort of audience that only finds common ground in a colosseum, united in bloodlust, cheering wildly for the death of a hedge fund.  It was the bizarrest of times.  Despite the best efforts of the digital revolutionaries, no Bastille is being stormed ��� though I would not be surprised if AOC has daydreamed about melting down the Wall Street bull and reshaping it into a working bronze guillotine. But there is no question that this week has been turbulent, playing host to more than its fair share of conflicts between the hoi polloi, arming themselves with digital tools, and institutions. Despite the revolutionary metaphors that have haunted this intro like a spectre reportedly did Europe, I don���t think this shapes out to be quite the battle of good vs. evil that some think. But it���s certainly something. And the memes have, in all fairness, been something else. Stealing the world���s attention and forcing every phone scroller to learn what short-selling is was the deranged saga of Robinhood and Reddit. It was well over a year in the making, but only this week did the world���s attention to the pending standoff between major hedge fund Melvin Capital and a Reddit group of amateur investors who mostly seem pretty intoxicated. Intervening between the two was retail trading app Robinhood and Gamestop���s extravagantly over-shorted GME stock.  The scene was set. r/Wallstreetbets had mobilized a substantial squad of retail traders willing to lose their whole investment in GME in an attempt to short-squeeze Melvin into bankruptcy. And, oh yeah, after such a short squeeze would come strong odds that GME spikes dramatically as Melvin was forced to buy up the market to pay off its debts. That is until Robinhood and a host of other retail apps turned off the buying function for GME on their apps.  While a broker-dealer has the right to stop trading in the event of major volatility, Robinhood investors ��� many of them holding GME as a result of a giveaway on the app ��� saw it as force majeure on behalf of Wall Street and a major assault on the app���s own user base. The internet as a whole was outraged as well, heavily in favor of Wall Street Bets, who seemed to represent the little guy, despite being a pretty aggressive and often quite offensive crew. Internet outrage, however, is not policy. Nor is it even the will of the people. The role of social media in manipulation of information has already taken center stage in a great deal of political debate, and there���s a good argument to be made that WSB is going to move that conversation into manipulating markets. But new guard in Congress and the White House are more eager to take the opportunity to bludgeon Wall Street as a clear signal of the end of Trumpian indulgence of financial kingpins. Democrats have spent the past year agog at a broad bull market that seems damn near idolatrous in the face of a pandemic-ridden economy. I suspect that however much Robinhood and its retail investors will be the pretext for everything we see from incoming Democrat-led financial legislation, the results will be more about proving a point.  Stonks, meanwhile, have had a rough day, and it looks like Robinhood���s loss will be crypto���s gain as retail interest turns to crypto exchanges. Iranians are reporting outages in access to encrypted messenger Signal.  Having attacked Bitcoin mining, accessed WhatApp messages, and done its best to cut off Telegram, Iran is now trying to cut off Signal, which has seen a boom thanks to new public interest in its end-to-end encryption.  Iran is a remarkably interesting place. It is home to an authoritarian theocracy grafted onto a remarkably well-educated and tech-savvy population. Both sides are miffed about being locked out of the global economy and information cycle. But while the regime busies itself getting around these blocks and, especially, sanctions, it seeks to monopolize that access at the expense of the people.  Crypto users and exchanges are fighting the Netherlands��� intensive and, they say, intrusive Know Your Customer rules.  The Netherlands is low-key home to some of the most demanding requirements for crypto exchanges in the EU and, by extension, the world. Since allowing crypto exchanges back into the country under a new regulatory regime a few months ago, De Nederlandsche Bank has instituted a reporting regime for transfers to wallets off-exchange that the U.S. Treasury can only dream of. In pursuit of information on ultimate beneficiary owners, De Nederlandshe Bank requires exchanges not only identify the owner of crypto wallets to which clients are trying to withdraw funds, but also that the clients prove that those wallets belong to them. Bitonic, the crypto exchange filing against the Dutch central bank, says there is no legal basis for that level of personal data collection.  Far from the largest country in the EU, the Netherlands has, nonetheless, maintained its centuries-old status as a trading hub for stocks. The fate of its KYC requirements may well determine whether that status carries on into crypto.  Yaya Fanusie and Emily Jin of the Center for a New American Security warn of China���s CBDC as a mechanism to add financial data to the regime���s surveillance arsenal. Teasing its coming crypto report, Chainalysis charts the massive rise in ransomware over the past year.  The Wall Street Journal runs down the case of the SEC v. Ripple, the result of which will determine the fate of the company.	1
Chinese regulatory bans are causing mass exoduses - from WeChat to Telegram, exchanges to LocalBitcoins and maybe soon China to Hong Kong. As news comes that a full Bitcoin-to-fiat exchange ban may come into effect Sept. 30, China���s crypto users and businesses are feeling the heat. Already, Hong Kong based exchange platform Gatecoin CEO Aurelien Menant says, requests for listings from mainland entities are up sharply. ���We have received a high number of inquiries from Blockchain project founders based in the mainland who would like to list their tokens on our exchange,��� he told the South China Morning Post today. ���Since last Friday, with the rumors of a possible tightening on the regulation of exchanges in the mainland, we have experienced a surge in the number of Chinese clients registering on our platform.��� Hong Kong has signaled it will fall in line with the US when it comes to ICO token regulation, contrasting with China itself. At the same time, panic appears to be setting in among traders anxious about government snooping. WeChat, China���s vast social network, is seeing a rare emptying of users as they migrate to anonymous platform Telegram to talk crypto. New laws placing responsibility for group chat users��� words on administrators is compounding the phenomenon, Bloomberg reports. ���If you are a group chat leader you have two choices, either you are going to super actively monitor the group, because your livelihood is at stake or you���re going to delete the group,��� a Hong Kong academic explained about the new status quo. Frantic international reactions to price volatility are meanwhile bringing big rewards to certain industry sectors such as p2p trading platform LocalBitcoins. Cointelegraph has already reported on the increasing returns of Chinese users since fears of an exchange ban first appeared. LocalBitcoins data for this week will become available Saturday via Coin Dance.	1
2017 has definitely been a record-breaking year for ICOs: a fiat equivalent of some $4 bln have been raised, and the number of successful token placements have increased to a couple of hundreds globally. Yet, in the same year, traditional IPOs are estimated to have raised $188.8 bln in total of 1,624 deals, according to E&Y IPO Global trends report. Only in third quarter, 2,645 venture capital deals amounted to $42 bln. ICOs have raised less about two percent of global IPO proceeds, but ICOs not IPOs, and not venture capital deals, are the talk of the street these days. Why? In one year only ICOs proceeds have surged almost 40-fold, from $96.3 mln in 2016. In 2014- 2015 the amount was microscopic. More than 180 new ICOs are scheduled to launch in 2018, according to ICObench listing. It would be superficial and arrogant to explain the ICO explosion only by desire of newly-rich crypto-miners to invest their unexpectedly reevaluated digital assets in something productive and to protect themselves against volatility. It may be the case, but it doesn���t explain the whole case. In fact, there are three root causes of ICO success. ICOs and cryptocurrencies exploit fundamental flaws of the traditional funding methodologies. They bring justice and equality to projects from underprivileged geographies, sectors, and don���t rob founders��� share while doing so. Traditional financing is tilted towards an intermediary, not a creator, and it is designed to lower the risks of that intermediary, not the investor or founder while maximizing intermediary���s yields. It basically works around the principle of Matthew 12:15 - ���Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.��� Simply saying, it takes money to get more money. Classic venture financing is orders of magnitude harder to achieve for those who live outside global hub cities. Most US funds won���t even consider financing an enterprise not domiciled in the US. Venture capitalists normally claim a hefty part of the equity in exchange for the money, so investors, irrespectively of their share, greatly influence the decision making of the founding team, and not always for good. The first answer to these problems were crowdfunding platforms. ICOs have just made another step towards reducing the friction behind crowdfunding, de-intermediating it further. Getting venture financing, let alone reaching for IPO afterwards, requires the team to distract themselves from the product development, marketing and promotion. Compliance, legal and due diligence procedures make the auxiliary mission of securing the funds for the project a separate task, as complicated or even more complicated than launching the product itself. It���s not the only reason behind the ICO triumph. Despite cyber-anarchists��� wet dreams, states won���t go anywhere anytime soon, and legal norms for ICO didn���t appear out of thin air. As they say in the military, service regulations are written in blood ��� of those who died to teach others a lesson. Stock exchanges and financial markets are regulated not exclusively to keep the profanes out. It is because most scams, frauds and crashes have already happened there. Sooner or later, ICOs will be regulated. And we should rather be a part of the solution to this problem, not the problem itself. In ideal post-Blockchain smart-contract, self-governing, crypto-anarchic world,  imagined by technophiles, we should all be singing ���Hosannas��� by now, praising human progress and ingenuity. But we wouldn���t be humans if a life-changing invention weren���t used to cheat, defraud and steal. Cryptocurrencies and subsequently ICOs aren���t an exception, and there are and always will be frauds of course. Traditional financing doesn���t necessarily offer substantially better investor protection. Even the most stringent due diligence doesn���t guarantee against fraud. Crypto investment schemes are especially prone to it because of anonymity.   ICO segment is still in its infancy, yet this baby is gaining weight alright. Childhood illnesses are many. First and foremost, crypto world has a severe reputation problem. The SEC calls for extreme precaution when investing in ICOs. To gain trust, we should start from within, and establish it first with the community. Even in the absence of governmental regulations, self-regulation framework of ICOs will inevitably arise. Moreover, to avoid overregulation and unnecessary intervention of governments, it is essential that the community keeps policing itself better than any regulator. That���s exactly where the sector is headed ��� otherwise, it won���t survive. In coming year ICOs will offer more projects to serve the broader community, not limiting itself anymore to the Blockchain infrastructure development, payments and speculative trading. It will less much less revolve around purely financial technology. In 2017, we have already seen examples of Blockchain notary public, Blockchain-based real estate investment, loyalty programs, supply chain management, intellectual property rights management and other real-world applications. We���ll see more of that in 2018. - By Sergi Dromo Sergi Dromo is a cyber pessimist, techno-philosopher and unorthodox thinker.	2
Bitcoin���s price is about to break out in what commentators expect will be a ���big move.��� Excitement among the cryptocurrency���s online traders is building Monday, as weeks of comparatively flat price action look to end soon. $BTC forming new triangle... watching the market closely, a big move is about to come#bitcoin #altcoin #fintech #thefutureishere pic.twitter.com/kEqt4hamN7 Bitcoin has been trading on average between $2,400 and $2,800 since June 16, a considerably less volatile period to that which preceded it, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Now, however, talk is growing of the virtual currency breaking out of its current triangle to set a new trend - up or down. $BTC Too much FUD on twitter. I would only react if support breaks. In here for the long haul, so even a dip would be a gift! ;) pic.twitter.com/cAEA1OEgw7 Short-term investors have been largely focused on altcoins such as Litecoin in recent weeks, with Ethereum having dropped and remained below $300 due to a turbulent bout of volatility at the end of June. The tips are once again swinging to focus on Bitcoin, with even veterans such as WhalePanda hinting increased exposure to it over altcoins. For the first time since the start of this $Crypto bubble I'm 65% in #Bitcoin, 15% in Fiat and only 20% in alts. The upcoming SegWit activation deadline of August 1 is in itself expected to produce more volatile price performance for Bitcoin, yet it remains to be seen in which direction its value will trend.	1
French electric utility company ENGIE and consulting firm Maltem Consulting Group have jointly established a blockchain development firm designed for commercial customers, according to a press release published September 7. The new project called Blockchain Studio received seed funding totalling ���1.9 million (around $2.1 million). Blockchain Studio has created a software suite for commercial enterprises comprised of two fundamental tools. One tool is focused on the development of smart contracts and enables its application by users without technical background. The other tool manages the creation of cloud-based or server-based blockchain infrastructure. According to the announcement, the company is planning to roll out its services primarily on the Asian market at the beginning of 2019, with an office in Singapore. By the end of the first financial semester of next year, Blockchain Studio will also open operations in Southern Europe. Yves Le G��lard, ENGIE���s Executive Vice-President and Chief Digital Officer expressed enthusiasm towards the new project: ���We are very pleased to be contributing to this development, which should allow Blockchain technology to be made accessible to many actors. It is an excellent example of an innovative tool contributing to ENGIE���s digital transformation.��� ENGIE has previously explored blockchain applications in its energy business. In July, the corporate research center of the ENGIE Group, ENGIE Lab CRIGEN, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the IOTA Foundation. The collaboration is focused on the exploration of and experimentation with IOTA Tangle technology in the energy sector.	1
The value of Dogecoin (DOGE) sank 23% in a matter of hours on Monday after Elon Musk drew attention to the vastly unequal distribution of DOGE tokens and urged major holders to sell off their holdings Dogecoin has one of the most unequal coin distributions in the cryptocurrency space, with 28.7% being held by just one person and the top 12 holders possessing almost 50% of the supply. On Sunday, Just before midnight UCT, Musk tweeted: A little over seven hours later, Dogecoin's price had plunged 23% from $0.063 to $0.048. While Musk���s tweets have previously been credited with moving cryptocurrency prices, not least Dogecoin, his role in Monday���s drop was less clear given that over $105 billion departed the rest of the global market capitalization at the same time.  Losses in excess of 20% were a common sight among the crypto market cap rankings, with altcoins, in particular, subject to an enormous pullback. Analysts suggest this was caused by Bitcoin���s (BTC) push to a new all-time high just hours earlier, which pulled volume out of the altcoin market.  Calculating the exact distribution of a given cryptocurrency can be difficult because public blockchains tend to be either pseudonymous or anonymous. But data from several available sources shows that almost 70% of the entire Dogecoin supply is held in just over 100 addresses. The founder of Dogecoin recently revealed that he sold all of his DOGE holdings in 2015 in the midst of financial difficulties after losing his job. Billy Markus started Dogecoin as a joke in 2013 based on the then-popular Shiba Inu dog meme. Markus said he struggled to comprehend, let alone explain, the meteoric rise of something that appeared to offer no real utility or value. Musk's flirtation with Dogecoin appears to be largely in the name of humor. The Tesla founder once proclaimed himself the self-appointed CEO of Dogecoin ��� an open-source cryptocurrency ��� and his interactions with the coin thus far have mostly been based around memes, rather than any kind of investment strategy.	1
The issue of transition to decentralised payment networks was raised again last week. On June 1, Visa, which usually processes more than 150 mln transactions daily, suddenly failed. Millions of people in the UK and Europe were unable to pay for goods or services, and Visa payments were also disrupted for US residents. Current queues at Tesco cash machines in MK. Suspect this is a common scene across the U.K. right now ���� #visadown pic.twitter.com/YunwFA8lYz Several hours later, the problem was solved, but the mere fact of widespread failure indicated the need for decentralized and stable alternative systems, where such incidents are simply impossible. Below we present an overview of several pioneers, which have chances for becoming similar to a ���crypto��� Visa or MasterCard. They don���t just offer a comprehensive solution for storing, paying or managing cryptocurrency, but also provide full-fledged tools for businesses. Even more important ��� transaction fees are three times lower or even non-existent compared to Visa���s 3 percent.  CEO: Tony Gallippi Founded: 2011 HQ: US Founded by Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair in May 2011, BitPay became the first operator to work with Bitcoin. The development of this project began due to the need to create a fast, safe, and cheap way of paying for goods and services. According to the creators of BitPay, the aim of the platform is to become crypto equivalent of Apple���s Apple Pay payment system, which is reflected in the similarity of their names. In 2017, BitPay processed more than $1 bln in Bitcoin payments. The next step for the company was developing a BitPay Visa debit card, which allows payment through POS-terminals, as well as deposits and withdrawals at ATMs. Bitcoin holders can buy a card for $9.95. Funds can be deposited into the account directly from the Bitcoin wallet or through an authorized provider. While BitPay takes a payment fee of up to 1.9 percent, processing speeds are a significant drawback. In order to increase the application���s reach and popularity, BitPay announced support for Bitcoin Cash in addition to other currencies in December 2017. While it may seem that the service has increased reliability, various rumors still persist around the application. For example, last summer the Bitcoin community accused BitPay of fraud. The fact is that BitPay misled users, saying that it is necessary to activate the BTC1 client while refusing from Bitcoin Core. The reaction of Bitcoin Core supporters, including Peter Todd, Tuur Demeestr, Francis Pulio, John Carvalho, Rodolfo Nowak and others was immediate. All of them were negative about BitPay's offer to use an alternative to Bitcoin Core. In particular, Peter Todd called the proposal fraudulent and encouraged other community members to participate in the proceedings. Programmer Eric Lombrozo appealed to his subscribers on Twitter to boycott any company supporting SegWit2x. On forums and in social networks around the web, an active discussion of the Bitpay offer continues. Two weeks later, on December 24, BitPay confused users again when it announced it would raise its minimum transaction amount to $100 in a December statement. In just two days, the company changed the value back to $5, further surprising users. CEO: Brian Armstrong Founded: 2012 HQ: USA When it comes to reputation, it���s worth noting one big player which launched on Feb. 14. The Coinbase Commerce service comes from the Coinbase exchange, and allows merchants to accept payment in digital currencies with the funds directly credited to the wallet of the user, leaving them in full control over the account. Functionally, the Coinbase Commerce plug-in is very similar to the PayPal payment system, requiring a phone number and an email address only. The product accepts payments in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin, and can be integrated into a checkout process or used as a payment service on e-commerce platforms. Coinbase has firmly established itself as a processing operator for businesses. For accepting payments in Bitcoin, merchants are not charged any commission, but for the conversion of funds the system retains a fee of 1 percent. It seems like numerous guides and videos like "Nobody Likes Coinbase Fees" or "How to Avoid Coinbase Commission" are now in the past. But will the recent release will help Coinbase to ���rehabilitate��� itself for 4 percent fees charged for debit cards operations? CEO: Steve Beauregard Founded: 2013 HQ: Singapore Before being publicly launched in 2013, GoCoin was developed by a single person for private purposes. Now it has become quite a popular digital currencies platform and offers a payment gateway for online and retail merchants to accept BTC, LTC, DASH and BCH transactions. It was one of the first platforms to introduce lower merchant fees ��� only 1 percent , which drops to 0 percent after transactions have exceeded $2,500 monthly. The platform can be installed as a plugin and allows customers to pay with the digital currency of their choice along with USD, EUR, and GBP. Several methods can be employed, from payment apps to hosted forms or buttons. Since 2013 over 500 mln transactions have been processed by GoCoin. What makes this platform promising is a big client base of 15,000 merchants globally, among which there are companies such as General Electric, Cozy Games, BitFury, and Tesla Motors. It���s also known that GoCoin is supported by a number of industry leaders like Owen Van Natta, former Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, and Brock Pierce, Blockchain Capital founder. CEO: Alex Alexandrov Founded: 2013 HQ: Canada CoinPayments began as the first multicoin payment processor in the world in August 2013. The platform focuses on creating an easy way for integrating a checkout system for a staggering 535 cryptocurrencies, including widely used ones such as BTC, ETH, LTC, and smaller alternatives like PinkCoin and Triggers. The company also offers a number of shopping cart plugins, as well as custom payment solutions and merchant tools. The level of service and the number of options are impressive for both buyers and sellers. The developers did not limit themselves only to payment instruments, and built the platform into a lot of online stores. Crypto lovers have a choice of 16 categories of goods, including games for XBOX, clothes, beds for cats and even cannabis seeds. Another peculiar feature available for users is the PaybyName service, which may simplify the life of any cryptocurrency trader or investor. By creating an account, you get a single address that can be used to send or receive any supported coins. Merchants are given one of the most favourable conditions in the market ��� simplified registration, customer support and fixed commissions of 0.5 percent. CEO: Vitaliy Andrusevich Founded: 2014 HQ: UK An ���all-in-one��� gateway to blockchain services, Coinsbank was founded in 2016 under a name of BIT-X. Initially, the BIT-X project had been conceived as a cryptocurrency prepaid cards service. After rebranding on August 15, 2016, Coinsbank become a full-fledged payment platform, and since then has been maintaining high standards in everything that is connected with exchanging or processing of cryptocurrencies. In spite of a relatively small choice of supported cryptocurrencies, the platform���s steady daily trading volume allows Coinsbank to hold a position in the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges. Perhaps, its high levels of security and user-friendly wallet service is more known than the above mentioned exchange. Analyst Roger Aitken compared its cold type storage with a bank���s deposit box: ���Think of this as being akin to a bank���s deposit box, with special access via two keys: one retained by the customer and the other by the bank. Here it's worth explaining that in terms of the security aspects offered by CoinsBank, that without a user key ���no external party��� to the wallet is able compromise its security. If, for example, someone hacked CoinsBank���s system ��� as was the case that befell Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitfinex back in August with the theft of over $60 mln Bitcoin - the former wallet cannot be bypassed/compromised as there is ���no possibility��� to initiate transactions or make movements from them without the user���s signature.��� Coinsbank revealed to Cointelegraph the information about the issue of cryptocurrency debit cards to be announced on the Blockchain cruise in September: ���Payment cards will be issued by the world's largest card provider and will be available for ordering users soon. The cards will work with cryptocurrencies available on the service ��� LTC, BTC, ETH, XRP.��� Let���s see whether the commissions will be as low as the current fixed merchant service fee of 0.5 percent. CEO: Hisyam Nasir Founded: 2017 HQ: Malaysia Other projects do not focus on exclusivity of services and rather aim for technological perfection. One of them is the GoByte Network, which is developing its own payment service and offers 0 percent fees for processing services inside the platform and non-cash payments. The GoByte Pay module interacts directly with the blockchain, creating and executing transactions which are later confirmed by masternodes and miners for technically challenged merchants and consumers on desktop, web, and mobile. Being fast, secure and easy to use, GoByte Pay allows user to have multiple wallets in one account. While only the GBX coin is currently available for payments, developers promise to add new coins after the Pay module���s release in June. The module is designed to solve the problem of a lack of adoption in retail stores by creating an API to help existing terminals easily connect to POS terminals. Along with InstandSend and free transactions, GoByte is planning to issue their own cryptocurrency debit cards, ATMs and POS terminals. A giant like Visa is a regular participant in conflicts with the aforementioned projects. In January 2018, Visa left users in Europe without debit cards. The order was sent to the payment platform WaveCrest, whose customers include several projects working with Bitcoin, including BitPay, TenX, Bitwala and Wirex. As a result many of them had to stop servicing non-US customers. The BitPay Card is no longer available from our European card issuer Wave Crest Holdings, Ltd. Learn more and see what's next for the international BitPay Card: https://t.co/lI9wFpyPWx NOTE: BitPay Card users in the United States are unaffected by this change. pic.twitter.com/uns1GVcgWJ This year, a scandal erupted between Coinbase and Visa, based on erroneous withdrawals of users accounts. 1/ We have determined that the erroneous credit and debit charges are the result of Visa reversing and recharging transactions. This was not done by Coinbase. We are working with Visa to ensure all affected customers are reimbursed. Developers of cryptocurrencies continue to pursue the goal of monetization with the help of processing systems. To date, fees for depositing funds through credit cards are 3 percent. It seems that many projects creators these days try to put their startups in mobile applications, bypassing the issue of plastic cards, since now the use of NFC on smartphones allows customers to instantly pay for the purchases made by placing their phone next to the seller's gadget. It could be much easier and more convenient to scan a QR code for mobile Bitcoin payments. Possibly in the near future, users will be able to completely opt out of QR in favor of NFC. In summary, there are no grounds at the moment for thinking that someone would compose a strong competition for the Visa system. For a large number of people, functional convenience, reliability, and ease of use outweigh commission costs which are almost 3 times smaller. It���s possible that one of the above solutions will earn a significant share of the cryptocurrency transactions, proving its security and developing positive relations with the necessary regulatory bodies. Meanwhile, against a background of ambiguous regulation in different jurisdictions, the future development of such projects remain difficult to predict.	1
Tether has always been a controversial token - claimed to be redeemable for fiat currencies but shunned by the fiat banking system. However, the rapid expansion in Tether supply has raised concerns about whether this could be one of the reasons for the overall cryptocurrency boom. According to the Company's website, Tether is a cryptocurrency whose value is anchored or 'tethered' to the value of national currencies like the US dollar. Tether.to claims to have combined the best of both worlds - a stable currency value and benefits of Blockchain technology. Each tether in circulation is supposed to be backed by a dollar held by the Company in reserve. The overall supply of tether has rapidly increased in 2017. Since the price of each tether is pegged to fiat (dollar or euro), the overall market capitalization reflects the underlying supply of tethers. The total market cap of tether has shot up from $6.9 mln in November 2016 to $645 mln currently. That is 100x increase in supply in the last year. A significant portion of the increase has occurred in the 15 days of November 2017 - the supply / market cap has increased by $200 mln in that time. Since each tether is supposed to be backed by a reserve of fiat currency, questions are being raised about how Tether (the company) has managed to expand its balance sheet so much in the last year. Tether.to has a transparency page which it claims represents the balance sheet of the Company in near real time. It also claims that the Company's reserves are subject to regular audits. After lots of criticism, Tether.to published a memo from Friedman LLP, who were hired as consultants to make limited findings (not audit) of the cash held by the Company as of 15-Sep-17. However, since the supply of tethers has increased substantially post Sep-17, concerns have again been raised on the assets held by Tether.to. Using non-existent money to trade can result in the price skyrocketing. It is alleged that the rapid bull run in 2013 was caused by 2 bots - Willy and Markus who bought Bitcoins at regular intervals, without spending real money. The resultant collapse of Mt. Gox and crash in Bitcoin's price took years to overcome. Helicopter money has a documented effect of fuelling inflation. The value of increase in Tether's supply ($200 mln) in the last month pales in comparison to Bitcoin's trading volume ($5 bln), but any fear about the currency pegs of tether would affect the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It could lead to people trying to redeem their tethers or dump them on exchanges. Social media is abuzz with doubts about the stability of Tether, with one user going so far as to offer a bounty if somebody could prove that Tether held sufficient cash in its bank accounts. What Tether.to needs to do is reassure the cryptocurrency community about the soundness of their balance sheet. This can be established through a full audit done by a reputed agency. They also need to be transparent about their assets - where exactly are their cash balances held and who are their bankers. Lastly, the Company's legal terms and conditions must not disown all responsibility for redeeming tethers There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. People believe that one tether can be redeemed for one dollar, and that is what gives it value. The Company would do well to affirm that, especially if its customers are able to demonstrate compliance with all know your customer / anti money laundering regulations.	0
The MIT Technology Review has published an article today, April 24, called ���Let���s Destroy Bitcoin,��� detailing three ways that the cryptocurrency could be ���brought down.��� The first option, according to the article, is a government takeover of Bitcoin with the creation of a Federal Reserve-backed coin (Fedcoin): ���The year is two-thousand-something-big, and it���s the day your taxes are due. But you don���t file them. Instead an algorithm automatically makes a withdrawal from your electronic wallet, in a currency called Fedcoin.��� This new blockchain would have verified financial institutions as the authorized nodes instead of peer-to-peer networks, ���basically, trusted institutions,��� Yale undergrad Sahil Gupta told the MIT Technology Review. The article notes that the Bank of Canada built a simulation of such a system on Ethereum (ETH) in 2016. Option two is a Facebook stealth takeover of Bitcoin, which involves the social media site creating a BTC wallet for all of its users, rewarding them in the cryptocurrency for interacting with ads, and giving them an ad-free experience if they let Facebook mine on their computer���s unused power (as Salon offered earlier this year): ���If Facebook could persuade a large enough fraction of Bitcoin users and miners to run its own proprietary version of the Bitcoin software, the company would thereafter control the rules. It could then refashion Bitcoin as a corporate version of the Fedcoin described above.��� Facebook could also take control away from Bitcoin by issuing their own cryptocurrency, just like messaging app Telegram is in the process of doing after their combined $1.7 bln Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) held earlier this year. The third way of making Bitcoin ���irrelevant��� is the creation of multiple new cryptocurrencies for every situation: ���You���re in the checkout line at the grocery store. Inside your phone���s digital wallet you find not only Fedcoin and FacebookCoin but also AppleCash, ToyotaCash, and a coin specific to the store you���re standing in. There���s also a coin redeemable for babysitting services, and another that gets you rides on your local subway system.��� This option, according to MIT Technology Review, is ���already happening,��� as companies are creating their own coins or tokens to be used just for their services, like Kodak���s ICO to form a currency used to license photographs. How Bitcoin can prevent any of these options from taking place is to capitalize on its advantages, namely that ���Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and impossible to censor.��� However, the article notes that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is already attempting to link people���s identities with their BTC addresses, according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, and if governments ���seek to create and enforce blacklists,��� they could pressure the ���crucial��� BTC miners. At the end of March, Snowden had said in an interview that Bitcoin���s Blockchain ledger was ���devastatingly public��� and that a good alternative to fiat that cannot be controlled by the government has not yet appeared. MIT Technology review concludes that ���if cryptocurrencies are to be widely used, it will be the habits of the masses, not the wishes of Bitcoin���s early adopters, that determine what becomes of Satoshi Nakamoto���s vision.���	1
Alameda Research and FTX exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried has amassed a fortune, mostly via crypto assets over the past few years according to New York Magazine. SBF, as he is known in crypto circles, spoke to the publication about his journey into the crypto industry since 2018. During the interview he estimated his own net worth at $10 billion, mostly in illiquid assets. The former Wall Street quant trader got into crypto trading in 2018 after noticing significant arbitrage opportunities, and worked out a way to take advantage of the ���Kimchi premium��� which was the difference in Bitcoin price between Korea and the rest of the world. He ended up in Japan due to restrictions in Korea and moved up to $25 million per day through intermediaries and local banks at the height of the price discrepancy, the report says.  His crypto empire, under the umbrella of Alameda Research, currently turns over $2 billion per day meaning it has significant market power. SBF currently focuses on developing the FTX crypto derivatives exchange and DeFi project Serum based on the Solana blockchain.  In January the FTX Token (FTT) rallied over 100% as the exchange surpassed BitMEX and Deribit's open interest. It is currently just cooling off from an all-time high of $13.60. SBF came to mainstream media attention last year after making a $5.2 million donation to Joe Biden���s political election campaign in November ��� the top contributor after billionaire Michael Bloomberg. The transaction he claims says was motivated by the Biden team���s ���generic stability and decision-making process���. FTX, which recently created a Wall Street Bets index including GME, AMC, and DOGE, also offers prediction markets and over $100 million in bets were placed on the exchange on election night. A self-confessed workaholic, SBF compares his own memory to computer RAM; 7) I'm (in)famous for playing League of Legends while on phone calls.I'll also try to avoid restarting my RAM if possible.One side advantage of the bean bags: if I sleep in the office, my mind stays in work mode, and I don't have to reload everything the next day. pic.twitter.com/AKlQm7wneI	1
Long Island, New York: a woman is facing up to 110 years in jail after trying to send $150,000 in Bitcoin and altcoins to ISIS. The New York Post reported how Zoobia Shahnaz fooled banks into giving her loans and credit cards, which she then used to purchase cryptocurrencies. The loan Shahnaz secured amounted to $22,500, while several credit cards contributed to a further $62,000 in cryptocurrency sent abroad to support the terrorist organization. Shahnaz, a US citizen, previously worked as a lab technician in a Manhattan hospital. Last year she traveled to Jordan to work with the Syrian American Medical Society as a volunteer medic in Syrian refugee camps where, according to court documents, ISIS had ���significant influence.��� In July of this year, the ISIS supporter was stopped and questioned in JFK Airport, apparently on her way to Syria and prevented from boarding. She was then arrested this Wednesday and charged with bank fraud and multiple counts of money laundering, Acting��� ���US Attorney Bridget Rohde said in a statement from the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday. The DOJ outlined Shahnaz���s activities as follows: ���...The defendant defrauded numerous financial institutions and obtained over $85,000 in illicit proceeds, which she converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. She then laundered and transferred the funds out of the country to support the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham [ISIS]��� The same statement claims that Shahnaz was prevented from accomplishing her goals in supporting ISIS, though to what extent remains unclear. In the statement, the FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney triumphantly stated: ���The FBI New York Joint Terrorism Task Force kept this woman from her dangerous and potentially deadly goal. We will do all we can to stop the next person hoping to do the same.���  According to the statement, if convicted, Shahnaz faces a maximum of 30 years for the bank fraud charge and 20 years on each money laundering count. The events are a blow to Bitcoin proponents, who have been trying to defend the cryptocurrency���s reputation from its birth. Bitcoin skeptics regularly claim that the cryptocurrency enables illicit activities, including money laundering and support of terrorism. In terms of terrorism, analysts have found that cryptocurrency does not play a major role in funding terrorist organizations. However, Shahnaz���s case, though isolated, certainly works against cryptocurrency���s reputation. Following the attacks in Europe this Summer, the European Union is seeking to understand the extent to which crypto is implicated in financing terrorist groups, and potentially to decrease the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions as much as possible.	0
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (Minfin) has presented the Digital Assets Regulation Bill which defines and establishes a regulatory system for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, mining and trading, local news agency TASS reported today Jan. 25. Notably, the central bank of Russia disagrees with Ministry of Finance that cryptocurrency exchange should be legally accepted. According to the central bank, the digital currency trading rules should be only applied to tokens that would attract financial investments. According to TASS, the authors of the bill are confident that the legal status of cryptocurrency would reduce the risks of fraud and provide fiscal transparency, which is expected to increase tax revenue of the government. In contrast, banning cryptocurrency trading would likely only lead to the emergence of a black market. The bill defines cryptocurrencies and tokens as digital financial assets which are not legal tender in Russia. As for cryptocurrencies and tokens exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, Russian ruble and foreign currencies, Minfin is reported to claim that it protects the funds of unqualified investors by allowing trading only via authorized cryptocurrency exchange operators. Concerning ICOs, tokens are allowed to be issued by legal entities or private operators for the purpose of fundraising. ICOs must be accompanied with legal documentation that discloses the details of the contract such as the issuer���s full name, physical location, official website and token���s price. According to the document, non-licensed investors will not be allowed to invest more than 50,000 rubles, equivalent to about $900 in each particular ICO. The final version of the bill was earlier reported to be scheduled for a release no later than July 1, 2018, according to Forklog, so the current version may still be altered until then.	2
The views expressed here are the author���s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com Decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have strong advantages over centralized financial systems, primarily because of their ability to function and operate without a single point of failure, which hackers and bad actors can target. On Feb. 19, Jameson Lopp, the lead engineer at multi-signature Blockchain security firm BitGo, noted that during a holiday in the US, local banks closed down, failing to provide financial services to individuals and businesses that could be in urgent need of financial settlement services to process payments. Today is a holiday in America - the banks and markets are closed. Meanwhile Bitcoin soldiers on, with over $1B transmitted and $7B traded today. https://t.co/SDYCGHTcsa pic.twitter.com/HetG9kES7I Meanwhile, Bitcoin, as a peer-to-peer (P2P) settlement system, was able to process over $1 bln worth of transactions, and more than $7 bln worth of Bitcoin was traded on a single day. Regardless of holidays and weekends, users of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ether can freely transact on a peer-to-peer basis, through the utilization of wallets. Non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets enable users to remain in full control over their funds, by only allowing users to gain access to their private keys and no other centralized entity or platform. As such, Bitcoin wallets like Blockchain, Trezor and Ledger cannot refund transactions or recover user accounts once the private key is lost, encouraging users to be more financially aware and responsible. As emphasized by Bitcoin analyst and RT���s Keiser Report host Max Keiser on several occasions, financial freedom and independence provided by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market are largely beneficial and crucial for individuals and businesses operating in regions wherein government entities control banks and financial institutions. Last year, Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince al-Waleed Bin Talal was arrested by the government of Mohammed Bin Salman, who is expected to take control over Saudi Arabia and become its ruler, as the most powerful figure in the Middle East. The government of Salman initiated an anti-corruption purge, arresting 11 Saudi princes and 200 businessmen. At the time, The Wall Street Journal reported that the government of Saudi Arabia had asked $6 bln for the freedom of Bin Talal, who has garnered a net worth of over $25 bln from his investments in Twitter ($300 mln), CitiGroup ($550 mln), AOL, Apple, MCI, Motorola, Fox Broadcasting and many more. On the Keiser Report, Keiser criticized the previous remarks of Bin Talal, who had called Bitcoin ���Enron in the making.��� "It just doesn't make sense. This thing is not regulated, it's not under control, it's not under the supervision of any central bank. I just don't believe in this Bitcoin thing. I think it's just going to implode one day. I think this is Enron in the making,��� said Bin Talal on CNBC���s Squawk Box. Criticizing Bin Talal, Keiser stated: ���He said Bitcoin was no good because there is no central government and no central bank. And then a week later, the central bank and the central government rips out all of his net worth. If he had them in Bitcoin, he wouldn���t have that problem. He is like a poster child for why you should buy Bitcoin. Anyone who is thinking about should I buy Bitcoin, look at [Talal] sleeping on a mattress of a rich hotel under house arrest. Furthermore, he is overrated as a money manager.��� In November 2017, the Saudi government cracked down on private bank accounts and froze the accounts of prices and businessmen. Keiser noted that could have been avoided if the wealth of these individuals were stored in a decentralized store of value, like Bitcoin. The offshore banking industry, which is dominated by influential financial institutions like JPMorgan, is structured around large banks that are able to clear big sums of money in an efficient and secure manner. But, the transfer of millions to billions of dollars require significant manual labor including transaction verification, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks and payment clearing. Cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Blocktower executive Ari Paul stated that cryptocurrencies have the ability to address the offshore banking industry that supersedes that of major banks: ���Cryptocurrency is trying to be the offshore banking system, I think. At least some of the cryptocurrencies. Most of the financial luminaries, I think genuinely, don���t understand what it���s trying to be. Jamie Dimon is an exception. By all accounts, I know people who spoke to him about cryptocurrency four years ago before I was really in the space. He understands it. I think he sees it as a competitor against JPMorgan,��� said Paul during an interview with Business Insider. Regarding transaction settlement, offshore banking, and financial freedom, centralized systems of banks fall significantly behind major cryptocurrencies, which can offer all three services with low costs and a robust infrastructure. Conclusively, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have significant advantages over banks in a number of areas, including security, borderless transaction settlement, efficient payment clearance, and lack of dependence on centralized service providers or entities.  Although the offshore banking industry is valued at $32 tln and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market remains below half a trillion, the above-mentioned advantages could allow cryptocurrencies to compete against banks across many sectors.	2
If we are to believe what we are told - the Bitcoin Blockchain has forked once again after the revival of SegWit2x. The fork, which was abandoned in November due to a lack of consensus among original signatories of the New York Agreement, proposed an increase in Bitcoin���s block size from 1mb to 2mb in an effort to improve its scalability. Much like Coinbase���s surprise announcement of Bitcoin Cash support a week ago, SegWit2x���s revival popped up on the internet courtesy of a new website, headed up by a completely new team of developers from those that had worked on the original SegWit2x code. The developers celebrated the launch of SegWit2x at block number 501451 on Dec. 28, although potential users will only have access to the new B2X coins on Jan. 15, 2018. The Long Awaited Launch of New Bitcoin SegWit2X Fork Finally Took Place! pic.twitter.com/GC46rYFoOI According to the website, B2X features will include a unique address format, a two and a half minute block generation rate while the mining complexity will be recalculated after each new block is generated. Furthermore, the block size will be increased to four mb, as opposed to the original two mb proposition by the original SegWit2x developers. Replay protection is also being touted, which was a major shortcoming in the proposed fork a few months ago. All of this sounds great - but it actually sounds too good to be true. In addition to their proposed changes, the developers have promised to give users a share of 2 million B2X coins, which they claim stem from Satoshi Nakamoto���s original pre-mined Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, B2X will have a 21 mln coin cap. We are told that supporters of the fork will get a share of Nakamoto���s originally mined Bitcoin, converted to B2X at a 1:1 ratio. ���In addition, we will distribute a proportional number of "Bitcoins of Satoshi Nakamoto" to all those who support hardfork! By ���Bitcoin of Satoshi Nakamoto��� we mean what the founder and chief developer of Bitcoin [BTC] mined at the time of zero network activity. They will be credited to the crypto-exchanges and wallets of our partners gradually. The list of partners will be constantly updated on our website! Even if Satoshi Nakamoto wants to get B2X for his pre-mining, he is not able to do this, as we blocked the initial blocks for conversion to Bitcoin SegWit2X. It is worth noting that this present to users who supported us will be credited sometime after the basic conversion 1:1��� Furthermore, the developers insist that only those two mln coins will be premined. ���Satoshi Nakamoto���s Bitcoin [BTC] will be mined and distributed proportionally to all Bitcoin holders on the crypto-exchanges and wallets of our partners (2 mln). There will be no additional pre-mining!��� As Cointelegraph reported on December 28, the SegWit2x GitHub repository actually shows that six mln coins will be premined - with three different addresses committed in the code at different block heights. The picture below shows two of the three different pre-mine commands going to different wallet addresses. What this suggests is that the developers will have access to 6 mln B2X coins when trading begins, giving them a massive amount of power over the valuation and supply of the newly-forked cryptocurrency. If and when people start trading B2X, there is a chance that the developers could pull a ���pump and dump��� move, selling their new coins at inflated prices, making quick returns on coins that they���d premined. According to Investopedia, this practice is a scam and is illegal. Another factor that points towards fishy behavior is the fact that B2X futures contracts are already available on some exchanges - meaning people have started betting on future valuations of the cryptocurrency. An insider could stand to make some massive short-term gains - with those futures having launched on Dec. 19, according to the website: ���Already now, Bitcoin SegWit2X futures [B2X] are traded on large crypto-exchanges, the list of which is constantly replenished. Stay tuned for updates on our website and social channels!��� Coinmarketcap data shows that futures trading of B2X has been highly volatile - after hitting a high $1205.05 on Dec. 27. That has now dropped to $272.25 as of Dec. 30: B2X will be supported by FreeWallet and Zumminer, but other wallet providers like Trezor have distanced themselves from the project on their Reddit page. It���s also bizarre to see that exchanges like Coinbase have not made any statements about the new launch. All of this information could point to an outright scam. A completely different team of developers seem to have hopped on the SegWit2x bandwagon, hijacked the name and are looking to make a quick buck out of gullible and uninformed investors. Their website may look legitimate, but poke around enough and there are holes everywhere. The fact that most of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges have not even recognized the fork or the new B2X coin shows that the legitimacy of the fork is questionable at best. It will be interesting to see what the coins are trading at on Jan. 15 - and how the wider cryptocurrency community reacts.	0
One of the biggest drawcards for the cryptocurrency market as an investment opportunity has been its openness and lack of prejudice. Anyone with access to the Internet can buy a crypto asset, and in most cases, see it grow exponentially. It is investing like never before seen, breaking with a number of traditional norms, but despite this obvious advancement in exclusivity, there are still huge issues around this new and burgeoning investment market. Regulation is such a polarizing word in the cryptocurrency space. Some see it as necessary for the survival and mass uptake of cryptocurrency, while others see it as the antithesis of what cryptocurrencies are trying to be. Having a controlling body does, of course, make a mockery of the inherent decentralization of cryptocurrencies, but it also adds a heap of protection and responsibility to it. Currently, the regulatory space is miles behind which also means that investors have very little protection if things go wrong with their investment. And, because there is such a frenzy and hype in the crypto investment market at the moment, people are throwing huge sums into the space. However, it is often said that these investments are a bit of a gamble, and not only because of the volatile price swings, but because things can still go wrong in the ���Wild West��� that is the cryptocurrency space. With exchanges being the biggest medium of cryptocurrency movement, they become targets for hackers. Many have lost funds in apparent hacks of exchanges with little to no recourse because of the unregulated space. Mt. Gox still sits as a huge precedent and pinnacle regarding the dangers of investing in cryptocurrency where billions of dollars of users��� money went missing in an apparent hack. Of course, the investment space is not truly the same ���Wild West��� it was five to seven years ago, and in fact, it is improving exponentially as people educate themselves more once entering the space. There is a balance between those who are entering the market purely because of the hype and a feeling of fomo, which leads to negatives for both those individuals and the market. These Fomo-buyers often end up in compromising positions which only leads to negative news. However, there are those who enter the market with a level of education thanks to the growing subsidiary space. There is more than enough material out there for people to consume before entering the market, and thus, leave themselves protected. There are even instances of companies making the transition to cryptocurrency that much easy, especially noted in the high profile launches from CME and CBOE. The futures options from these changes have made it possible for those who were either skeptical or unsure to enter the market and benefit in a regulated space. The inclusivity of the cryptocurrency market is all important, and with that, it needs to be safe and approachable for the success of this so-called digital currency revolution. Wall Street and its snooty investment profile, full of ties and briefcases, no longer fits into the global narrative. The cryptocurrency ecosystem, however, is amorphous and open.	0
The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, or CVM, approved two cryptocurrency ETFs this week ��� one 100% Bitcoin and the other composed of five cryptocurrencies, in addition to Bitcoin (BTC). For QR Asset Management, manager of the Bitcoin-only ETF, the product could accelerate the launch of a similar product in the United States, since the CVM, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, are part of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO.  Both ETFs will be traded on the Brazil's Stock Exchange, or B3. According to Brazil Journal, two of the country's main banks, Ita�� and BTG Pactual, have already stated to offer Hashdex's ETF to their customers. The QR ETF will trade on the B3 with the ticker QBTC11, while the one from Hashdex will have HASH11 as its ticker. ETF HASH11 trading is expected to start this month, while QBTC11 ETF is expected to begin in Q2 2021. In the case of QR ETF, the index used to calculate the price of Bitcoin will be the Chicago Commodities Exchange. Fernando Carvalho, CEO of QR Capital, holding company of QR Asset, sees this movement as an important milestone for innovation in the Brazilian capital market. In internal communication with Cointelegraph, he said: Hashdex's ETF will replicate the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), an index developed by Nasdaq and Hashdex. In September 2020, the Brazilian Hashdex got approval from the Bermuda regulator and together with Nasdaq, approved the world's first Bitcoin ETF ��� the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. Beyond Brazil, the only other country to approve its own Bitcoin ETFs is Canada. NCI consists of six cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Chainlink (LINK), and is rebalanced quarterly. Custody of Hashdex's assets is made by companies such as BitGo, Coinbase, Fidelity and Gemini, which are all mediated and regulated in the USA.	2
Hong Kong regulators have moved to ban retail trading in Hong Kong after months of intense speculation about a likely prohibition. According to a report by Reuters on Friday, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau of Hong Kong has released the results of its consultation on a possible retail crypto trading ban, which began back in November 2020. As part of its conclusions, Hong Kong���s FSTB called for a comprehensive licensing regime for crypto exchanges while restricting trading only to qualified investors. Per Hong Kong law, only individuals with portfolios worth 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million) qualify as professional investors. For the FSTB, the retail crypto trading ban is necessary at least in the early stages of the comprehensive crypto licensing regime. The FSTB reportedly plans to present its conclusions before legislators in Hong Kong to facilitate the passage of the proposal into law. If passed, the proposed licensing regime will also replace the current opt-in paradigm for crypto exchanges in the city. By limiting crypto trading in Hong Kong to persons with portfolios worth at least $1 million, the FSTB is potentially excluding up to 93% of the city���s population from gaining access to cryptocurrencies. Several stakeholders in Hong Kong���s vibrant crypto industry have expressed their dissatisfaction with the plan in the past, arguing that the move was inimical to the government���s goal of encouraging financial innovation. In another related development, Hong Kong���s government is reportedly planning to empower the city���s Securities and Futures Commission to withdraw the licenses of already authorized crypto exchanges. Tweeting on Friday, Chinese crypto media outlet 8BTC News revealed that the SFC may soon be given the power to exercise the right at will. Back in November 2020, the SFC announced a proposal to expand its crypto oversight responsibilities beyond security tokens to cover all digital asset service providers.	0
Roughly $2.3 billion worth of Bitcoin futures is set to expire on Christmas day, setting the stage for a volatile week in the cryptocurrency market.  In a Monday tweet, crypto data provider Skew reported that 102,200 Bitcoin (BTC) options will expire on Friday. Options contracts allow holders to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price, which is known as the strike price. The Friday expiry has notable clusters around the $15,000 strike price and the $20,000 strike price, according to Skew.  The expiry date of Bitcoin options contracts is widely regarded as a volatile event for the flagship cryptocurrency because, as the expiry nears, holders adjust their contracts. Traders who are in profit may also decide to receive the payout and dump the cryptocurrency.  Such events have been known to cause large fluctuations in Bitcoin���s value. Typically, the impact of a contract on BTC price becomes more apparent roughly one or two days before expiry.  Crypto derivatives trading has soared this year as more traders and institutional investors look for added Bitcoin exposure. Last week, crypto derivatives platform Deribit began offering Bitcoin futures with a $100,000 strike price expiring on Sept. 24, 2021. In other words, Bitcoin enthusiasts who think the cryptocurrency will reach a six-figure moonshot can now take that bet in the futures market.  Bitcoin is currently in the midst of a bull market that���s being fueled in part by institutional investors and large over-the-counter trades. Even with the anticipated futures volatility, there���s a good chance that Bitcoin will remain well supported by institutional demand and the rise of so-called illiquid wallets ��� i.e., addresses that have sent less than 25% of the BTC they���ve ever received. Chainanalysis believes illiquid wallets hold 77% of the 14.8 million mined BTC that hasn't been lost.	1
As digital asset markets suffer a broad pullback, cross-chain bridge protocol Ren has announced integrations with EMV-compatible chains Fantom and Polygon that could bolster liquidity across the DeFi ecosystem.  In a blog post on Friday, Ren announced that the RenVM bridge now supports the trustless transfer of four popular cryptocurrencies to Fantom, including Bitcoin (BTC), DOGE (DOGE), and ZCash (ZEC). Three additional Fantom bridge assets are coming in as well, including Filecoin and LUNA. Likewise, in a post on Wednesday, Ren announced a similar seven-asset integration with Polygon:  Excited to announce the launch of a direct bridge to Polygon by @renprotocol! With the Polygon x RenVM Bridge, users can move #BTC and many more assets directly to Polygon, enabling high-speed, low-cost txns for these assets. Start bridging now: https://t.co/91xPP2E2cp pic.twitter.com/E9AkveROGR The Fantom announcement also noted that Ren is ���currently working on adding Ren-based assets to Curve, QuickSwap, BadgerDAO, and beyond.��� While Ren serves as a bridge between chains, a recent collaboration with BadgerDAO on Ethereum demonstrated that a partnership with a DeFi protocol can drive protocol fees and volume for all parties. In Badger���s case, one-click bridge-and-deposit functionality has driven Badger���s WBTC vault to a quarter billion in TVL.  Per BadgerDAO���s founder Chris Spadafora, $150 million in BTC has already passed through the joint protocol bridge.  Just crossed $150M in #Bitcoin through the bridge.Next stop bridging BTC to earn on;@0xPolygon @FantomFDN @solana https://t.co/JcMrGFAFI7 Sidechains like Fantom and Polygon have become increasingly in-demand in recent months as developers, investors and farmers look for ways to escape Ethereum���s high gas fees. Prior to the recent market slump, EMV-compatible chains played host to implementations of major Ethereum-native DeFi protocols, while side-chain tokens like MATIC have proven to be among the most resilient to the recent bearish price action.  A popular Fantom community account hailed the trustless bridge as the ���holy grail��� for the chain, noting that the bridge has the potential to significantly bolster total value locked (TVL) metrics for Fantom���s various DeFi protocols, including SushiSwap, Curve and C.R.E.A.M.  This has been a long time coming. Back in September of last year the $REN bridge was the holy grail for our network. This is a welcome development however and will add to the TVL on $FTM. Which is good for everyoneGreat job @renprotocol ! https://t.co/pjlpaHvRps ���The addition of Fantom will greatly benefit each protocol by bringing more utility to Fantom and even more velocity through RenVM,��� said Ren's chief operating officer Michael Burgess in a blog post. ���We could not be more excited for this to go live, as it���ll help bolster utility for the entire DeFi ecosystem.���	1
In a video published on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that the operation of traditional banks will eventually become obsolete and could be replaced by Bitcoin. He based his claim on the trustless nature of Blockchain technology and on Bitcoin���s continuous, notable growth this year. In the video, Netanyahu stated confidently that banks will eventually become outmoded and be replaced, though when and by what exactly remains to be seen: ���Is the fate of banks that they will eventually disappear? Yes. The answer is yes. Does it need to happen tomorrow? And do we need to do it through Bitcoin? That���s a question mark.��� The head of the Israeli state also spoke about the role of banks, explaining that they were created and continue to exist to ensure that transactions between two parties are valid and secure. Banks, not to mention governments, continue to control how money is spent and continue to benefit from that control, at the cost of the transacting parties. Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrency, makes it possible for people to transact directly. The decentralized technology itself, rather than a centralized institution, ensures that transactions between people are valid and secure. ���The truth behind what I just said is what���s propelling Bitcoin upwards.��� However, the prime minister also expressed doubt in the ability of Bitcoin to continue growing at such an astonishing rate, stating: ���There���s nothing like this, that will continue rising at this rate, it can���t happen.���	1
Tyler Winklevoss, one of the first reported Bitcoin (BTC) billionaires and the co-founder of Gemini, believes the ultimate bull case for Bitcoin means reaching a target of $500,000. The theory for a $500,000 long-term Bitcoin price is straightforward. Winklevoss believes Bitcoin could overtake gold as the global market���s leading safe-haven asset.  Since the market capitalization of gold is estimated to be $9 trillion while Bitcoin is valued at around $200 billion, this could leave a 45-fold upside. Investors have relied on three stores of value for many decades, namely gold, oil and the U.S. dollar. But all three have distinctive weaknesses.   The advantages of Bitcoin over gold. Source: Tyler Winklevoss Gold and oil are difficult to transport and store, but more importantly, neither have a fixed supply. As such, if a large supply of both assets potentially gets discovered ��� although the probability of it is slim ��� it might negatively affect their value.  Winklevoss explained: ���Currently, gold is a reliable store of value and the classic inflation hedge. Supply. The supply of gold is actually unknown. While gold remains scarce or ���precious��� on planet Earth, the same cannot be said with respect to our galaxy.��� The biggest problem of the U.S. dollar is inflation and the stability of its value. As seen in its performance over the past four months, fears of inflation and economic uncertainty could destabilize the dollar for extended periods. If inflation occurs in the long term, Winklevoss noted that gold or Bitcoin could outrun capital stored in banks. He added: ���Inflation is coming. Money stored in a bank will get run over. Money invested in assets like real estate or the stock market will keep pace. Money stored in gold or bitcoin will outrun the scourge. And money stored in bitcoin will run the fastest, overtaking gold.��� With Bitcoin, inflation is not possible due to its fixed supply of 21 million. Unlike gold and oil, it would always remain scarce and it is easy to transport and store. Given these characteristics of Bitcoin, Winklevoss said he believes Bitcoin is the ���only long-term protection against inflation.��� In recent months, especially following the pandemic in March, the demand for digital products and currencies has soared. The concerns of inflation may further intensify after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank is looking to exceed its average inflation target. In fact, Winklevoss believes that the Fed is the ���biggest booster��� of Bitcoin���s value.  As an example, MicroStrategy, a public company based in the United States, recently purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin to use it as the firm���s primary treasury asset. Rapid adoption, growing institutionalization, improving infrastructure and rising liquidity could buoy the ultimate bullish case for the valuation of Bitcoin.  Winklevoss stated: ���If we are right about using a gold framework to value bitcoin, and bitcoin continues on this path, then the bull case scenario for bitcoin is that it is undervalued by a multiple of 45. Said differently, the price of bitcoin could appreciate 45x from where it is today, which means we could see a price of $500,000 U.S. dollars per bitcoin.���	1
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has said it is ���considering��� introducing a digital version of its national currency, the hryvnia, that is not based on Blockchain, at least for now. The central bank reported in a Facebook post Thursday Jan. 11 that it is studying ���new and innovative technologies��� as part of the country���s so-called Cashless Economy project, of which the potential e-hryvnia is a part. The NBU drew a distinction between the digital currency it has in mind and a state-issued cryptocurrency, which would by definition be based on Blockchain technology: ���However, the National Bank would like to specify that what is meant here is the possible introduction of an electronic hryvnia, not our own cryptocurrency.��� The NBU also noted that the possibility of basing their proposed e-hryvnia on Blockchain is still up for discussion. The plans for a digital hryvnia versus a national cryptocurrency contrast with activities across the border in Russia, whose government has been flirting with the idea of a Blockchain-based CryptoRuble since 2015. In addition, fellow CIS member Belarus has proclaimed its intention to become a cryptocurrency-friendly zone, facilitating easier regulated exchange and attracting foreign investment. Meanwhile, Ukraine���s cryptocurrency scene made headlines for more nefarious reasons in December 2017. The sudden police raid of crypto journal ForkLog in Odessa was followed by the kidnapping of EXMO exchange director Pavel Lerner in Kiev. Lerner has since reportedly been released for a $1 mln ransom. Ongoing regulatory moves by lawmakers this week have also seen the creation of a dedicated working group to investigate how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be treated under Ukrainian law.	1
Regulators across the world are waking up to the fact that there is a serious amount of money changing hands during ICOs. The latest to issue a statement about ICOs is the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC). Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory located south of Spain, is an established international financial centre. Major international finance firms have established a presence there, to benefit from low taxes, access to the EU single market and an established legal system. Casinos and finance firms are the growth engines of Gibraltar. Experts had previously opined that Gibraltar could be a great place to set up Bitcoin-based funds. With increasing numbers of ICOs, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission has issued a statement saying that it is putting in place a regulatory framework for companies which use Blockchain (or distributed ledger technology) to store or transfer value. This framework is expected to be in place by January 2018. It has warned investors that ICOs are highly risky and speculative, and investment is best left to professionals who are experienced in assessing that risk. The SEC in the United States has periodically issued warnings about the risks posed by investing in ICOs. In July 2017, it came out with a clear announcement that ICO tokens may be securities, in which case ICOs would have to follow all the rules and regulations associated with securities offerings. While it did find that the Ethereum DAO indeed constituted a securities offering, it did not file charges and used this as an opportunity to educate the fledgling industry. China's recent action against ICOs was sudden and abrupt. In September 2017, China banned all ICOs, classifying them as illegal fundraising. China also asked all organizations and individuals to return money raised through ICOs. The ICO mania exploded in 2017. From around $250Mn raised through ICOs in 2016, the amount of money raised in ICOs in year-to-date has exceeded $1.5 bln (and there are still three months left in 2017). The ICO mania started in the first few months of 2017, when divisions within the Bitcoin community about scaling resulted in investors looking elsewhere. A deluge of money was poured into altcoins, resulting in their valuations reaching stratospheric levels. This resulted in many companies planning ICOs, issuing tokens to fund their development. Since these tokens tend to jump in price when they get listed on exchanges, investors treated ICOs as speculative vehicles and companies have been able to raise millions of dollars in a matter of minutes. Before the ICO boom, early stage companies had few options but to turn to venture capitalists (VCs) to raise funds. This resulted in a system of checks and balances, since VCs did their own due diligence about the viability of a company's business model. VC involvement also imposed discipline by limiting the way these companies could use the funds raised. With the advent of ICOs, companies have a quicker and easier option to raise money. Unfortunately, any company with a whitepaper and a half-baked business model has also been able to raise significant sums through ICOs. Hence regulators have tried to step in before individual investors lose money in fraudulent ICOs. A balance has to be found, where only select investors such as high net worth individuals (the SEC calls them ���accredited investors���) can invest in ICOs. Even then, ICOs should be required to meet basic disclosure requirements. Reasonable solutions must be found that don���t strangle the newborn ICO industry, but that don���t allow too much harm to come to individual investors.	1
Ethereum, the number two digital currency by market capitalization, topped $600 today to set a new all time high. According to CNBC, the surge comes as UBS announced they will head an Ethereum-based Blockchain initiative along with Barclay���s, Credit Suisse, KBC, Swiss stock exchange SIX and Thomson Reuters. The initiative is designed to help these companies comply with new European Union trade data standards that go into effect in 2018. Ethereum���s rise comes amongst an overall good day for cryptocurrencies, as the total market cap now exceeds $492 bln. All of the top 22 digital currencies have experienced gains today, many of them by double-digit percentages. What���s more, as Bitcoin continues its gradual grind upwards, altcoins are not giving up their gains. This is causing total market cap to inch ever closer to the magical half a trillion dollar mark. Ethereum has been one of the top performers since its inception, dwarfing the huge returns that most other digital currencies have posted. Ethereum originally sold in a mid-2014 crowdsale for about $0.30 per token, which works out to about an 2000x return on investment. Put differently, $1,000 invested in Ethereum���s ICO would be worth $2 mln today. At press time, Ethereum sits at $609 according to coinmarketcap.com.	2
The introduction to the cryptocurrency world is always Bitcoin, but as investors get to know the place the draw of altcoins gets bigger and bigger. A quick buck is always on the cards but so is a total bust. Many think that Bitcoin is volatile, yet it has nothing on some of the moves, both up and down of some of the altcoins out there. To this end, there is money to be made but it is a different ball game and a different tact is required. There are a few strategies that can be employed when it comes to altcoin investing that are very different to Bitcoin investing, but these can also help you see massive paydays. To really get an understanding of the difference in investing in Bitcoin and altcoins, it is useful to see a graph of the performances. From the graph below, it is quite clear to see firstly why Bitcoin is still the king of easy and seemingly guaranteed returns. And secondly, it also shows just how erratic and chaotic the altcoin market is.  Image Credit: Woodbull The orange line represents Bitcoin while the mass of blue and green is the altcoin market which is clearly a difficult mess to master. However, a few choice strategies can be helpful. Invest in an altcoin while it is still in its ICO phase. This will guarantee the cheapest possible coin. While ICOs are literally a dime a dozen, if you are venturing into the murky world of altcoin investing the ICO phase is the best start. Coins literally only have one way to go, and that is up, after the ICO but they can also tumble very quickly and fall to zero. As the coin hits the market though, it can spike and that is your cue to sell. In this way, you can easily profit between 100 and 300 percent. If there is no immediate spike, aim to get between 50 and 100 percent return before selling. This strategy works well if you hedge your bets and buy into a few ICOs, don't put all your money into one basket/ICO. You can also hold out for a coin to hit the market and avoid the ICOmania. Look for a coin that hits its first dip on the market and take aim at buying; this can even lead to a cheaper buy than the ICO sale price. The reason a lot of these coins dip when they hit exchanges is because presale buyers and those that received free coins for helping market the ICO are dumping coins on the market. Do be aware though because this dumping can skew the market cap of the company. Holding on a little longer can also be beneficial as you watch the new altcoin go through its first spike and dip. Analyze the charts and see how it starts to move against chart indicators such as MACD, Signal and basic technical charting. This is a more complicated and intensive strategy but also a lot less risky. Keep an eye on candle patterns, as well as the volume, to see if it is falling or rising. You can also continuously compare the market cap to other similar coins to see if it is over or undervalued. This method is much more of an intelligent feel strategy; you are assessing the conditions of an asset and determining its direction. It also goes hand in hand with the saying: ���Buy the rumor, sell the news.���	1
A crypto artist known as "Neitherconfirm" recently listed 26 nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, for sale on OpenSea's digital marketplace. Things took an unexpected turn earlier Tuesday, however, after the artist changed the images associated with each token from computer-generated portraits into photos of literal carpets. It's a knowing comment on a DeFi token exit scam known as a 'rugpull' where a little known token suddenly collapses when liquidity disappears, metaphorically pulling the rug out from under victims' feet.  The art pieces, which originally featured people and animal faces in a seemingly stained-glass style, are now nothing more than an expensive metaphor for why you can���t trust the store-of-value proposition of any asset that maintains an aspect of centralized control. I just pulled the rug at my NFT collection on @opensea . Nobody got hurt.It is pretty easy to change the jpg, even if it does not belong to me or it is on auction. I am the artist, my decision, right?A thread from somebody making his living with art irl about the value of NFTs. pic.twitter.com/LNAZqPpDMZ ���All discussions about the value of NFTs are meaningless as long as the token is not inseparable from the artwork itself,��� said Neitherconfirm. ���What is the meaning of creating an unforgeable token on a highly secured network if somebody can alter, relink or destroy your possession? As long as the value of your artwork is reliable on a central service you do not own anything.��� The current price disparity between the artist's seemingly similar rugs seems to lend some validity to their claims. At the time of publication, the top bid on many of the NFTs is for under $1.00, while one (which currently has no offers) is listed for an astonishing $139 quadrillion ��� or around 80,000 times the market capitalization of the entire crypto space. Neitherconfirm has since implied that they have received more offers on their rugs than they did on the original portraits. Though the artist's identity is unknown, they stated on Twitter that their full-time job is ���making sculptural art��� under a top-selling artist that regularly sells pieces for more than $10 million. Neitherconfirm told Cointelegraph that rather than making unique computer-generated rug images, they simply found pictures of carpets in a web search ��� some with watermarks included ��� and turned them into NFTs. The crypto space is currently experiencing a massive boom in the quantity and value of nonfungible tokens. While crypto artists were auctioning their works for up to $130,000 late last year, 2021 has seen NFT prices inflate to once-unfathomable amounts. Back in February, the owner of an NFT created by Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, resold the piece on Nifty Gateway for a record-breaking $6.6 million. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey recently jumped in on the action as well, auctioning off tokenized ownership of the first-ever tweet. He has promised to convert any proceeds into Bitcoin (BTC) and donate them to nonprofit organization GiveDirectly's Africa Response. At the time of publication, the highest offer on the tokenized tweet is $2.5 million. ���Right now the appeal of NFTs is the status of owning one,��� said MyEtherWallet founder and CEO Kosala Hemachandra. ���NFTs are hot in the same way lambo���s are hot to Bitcoin purists. I think this current version of non-fungible tokens will continue to evolve into bigger and broader use cases.���  However, Neitherconfirm claimed that pieces of art are ���only a store of monetary value if they possess artistic value��� as well as subjective beauty: The artist noted in a pinned tweet that they will donate 51% of all profits from the rug-pull NFT series to charity. Cointelegraph reached out to Neitherconfirm for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.	2
Russia has officially completed its first government-level Blockchain implementation. The state-run bank Sberbank announced today that it is partnering with Russia���s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to implement document transfer and storage via Blockchain. According to local sources, the move represents the first case of direct government implementation of Blockchain technology. On the wider implications of the decision, Andrey Tsarikovskiy, the stat�� secretary and deputy head of FAS, stated in the Sberbank press release: ���Our country is opening up new possibilities for the economy through the use of advanced knowledge and technology. Making the system launch a reality means we are not only one of the first actual users of Blockchain for government in the world, but also [are pioneering its use] as a practical tool for further growth.��� The Russian government has shown consistent interest in advancing Blockchain technology development in the country for several years. In June of this year, President Vladimir Putin met with Ethereum���s Vitalik Buterin. In August the state-owned bank VEB signed an agreement with the Ethereum Foundation to develop Blockchain education programs in the country. In contrast, the government���s official position on cryptocurrency use for regular citizens remains relatively strict.	2
After solid growth to break above the $7,000 mark earlier today, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a loss of around $500 in six hours. At press time, all of the top ten cryptocurrencies other than Tether (USDT) are in the red, according to Coin360.  Market visualization from Coin360 BTC is trading around $6,598 at press time, dropping 5.29 percent over the last day and bringing a new weekly low. The decline follows today���s news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed its decision on the listing and trading of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the end of September.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a staff letter on Jan. 18, directed at two Wall Street trade groups that are interested in opening ETFs and mutual funds based on Bitcoin (BTC). The letter makes the case that companies offering cryptocurrency-based investment products are not yet able to comply with SEC regulations. Dalia Blass, the SEC���s director of investment management, wrote in the letter: ���We appreciate that proponents of cryptocurrencies and related products have identified a range of potential benefits. We are also aware that critics of cryptocurrencies have raised various concerns regarding transparency of information, trading, valuation and other matters related to the nature of the underlying assets. In light of these considerations, we have, at this time, significant outstanding questions concerning how funds holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies and related products would satisfy the requirements of the 1940 Act and its rules.��� The Investment Company Act of 1940 is the source of regulation for all mutual funds, closed-end funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, and holding companies. The letter contains questions that the SEC believes must be answered in order for them to consider supporting the idea of a cryptocurrency-based fund. Blass writes that the valuation of crypto portfolios at the end of each day will be difficult due to the volatility of the market and the nature of Blockchain protocol: ���For example, how would they address when the blockchain for a cryptocurrency diverges into different paths (i.e., a ���fork���), which could result in different cryptocurrencies with potentially different prices?��� The SEC also sees liquidity as a potential problem since, according to the 1940 Act, a fund must be able to allow its investors to easily liquidate their holdings at the end of each day. The risk of fraud and market manipulation, already brought up in an August 2017 SEC bulletin in relation to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), is again repeated in this letter in relation to exchange-traded funds (ETF). In early January 2018, the SEC had asked two Bitcoin-related ETF proposals to be withdrawn, citing the same concerns over liquidity and valuation underlined in the most recent letter. The SEC���s final position on the possibility of Bitcoin-based funds is currently unfavorable. Until the questions posed in the letter are ���addressed satisfactorily���, Blass writes: ���we do not believe that it is appropriate for fund sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest substantially in cryptocurrency and related products, and we have asked sponsors that have registration statements filed for such products to withdraw them.���	0
The crypto-friendly state of Wyoming has approved the first legally recognized decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) in the United States. BLOCKS was the first DAO Limited Liability Company (LLC) approved by Wyoming's blockchain legislation following an initial filing on June 17. BLOCKS aims to onboard businesses and industry onto the blockchain so that they can benefit from a DAO structured environment. It also has its own governance token of the same name. The American CryptoFed DAO also received notice from the Wyoming Secretary of State���s office on Tuesday recognizing it as a legal entity after it filed on July 1, according to a Sunday announcement.  Marian Orr, CEO of the American CryptoFed DAO, stated: The Merchant Advisory Group (MAG), which represents 165 of the largest merchants in the U.S., expressed its support of the filing. John Drechny, CEO of the MAG, stated that the group has always advocated for more competition in the payment-acceptance space. The American CryptoFed DAO was established by mobile banking solutions provider mSHIFT on July 1, 2021. The project describes its mission as promoting a two-token economy that is immune from inflationary or deflationary influences. Orr emphasized that the DAO���s native algorithmic stable token, the Ducat, facilitates fee-free transactions. The Ducat is based on EOS, which uses a delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus to achieve high-speed transactions at the expense of decentralization.  New tokens are issued through interest that is paid to Ducat holders and rewards issued to the network���s users. Ducat rewards and interest rates are adjusted dynamically by machine learning, with the Ducat intended to appreciate against the U.S. dollar by the amount of inflation the dollar experiences. The DAO also issues its governance token, Locke, which is used to stabilize Ducat. The governance token is issued in compliance with the Token Safe Harbor Proposal 2.0 outlined by Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Hester Peirce in April. Wyoming has been at the forefront of pioneering permissive crypto regulations in the U.S. in recent years, with state regulators working alongside Avanti Bank & Trust���s Caitlin Long to develop a banking charter framework for crypto firms. In September 2020, Kraken received a Wyoming bank charter, making it the first crypto business allowed to operate as a bank in the United States. Avanti followed suit in October. In March of this year, Wyoming became the first state in the nation to pass legislation into law recognizing DAOs as a distinct form of limited liability companies. This article has been updated to reflect the fact that BLOCKS was approved before American CryptoFed.	2
Bitcoin (BTC) is an essential investment as the world is about to face a ���major banking crisis,��� popular author Robert Kiyosaki has warned. In a tweet on Aug. 21, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad told followers that there was no time to ���think about��� investing in safe havens. The reason, he said, was that Warren Buffett had chosen to dump bank stocks. ���WHY BUFFET is OUT OF BANKS . Banks bankrupt. MAJOR BANKING CRISIS COMING FAST,��� he wrote.  ���Fed & Treasury to take over banking system? Fed and Treasury ���helicopter fake money��� direct to people to avoid mass rioting? Not a time to ���Think about it.��� How much gold, silver, Bitcoin do you have?��� Kiyosaki is a well-known supporter of Bitcoin, frequently advising the public to buy and actively concern itself with the downward trajectory of fiat currency. The coronavirus crisis has only exacerbated his calls to exit dependency on fiat, in line with various Bitcoin proponents who fear that coronavirus responses by governments have all but doomed already inflated paper money. In the intervening period since March, when macro assets crashed en masse, both Bitcoin and precious metals have seen huge gains, fueled by the U.S. dollar currency index hitting its lowest in two years.

Research into the top ten crypto deals in 2017 based on their investment returns (ROI) has revealed that on average each returned over 136,000 percent, according to data shared with Cointelegraph by Crypto Finance Conference (CFC) analysts July 27. Out of all the crypto projects that raised a minimum of $1 million in 2017, IOTA (MIOTA) clinched a staggering 614,934 percent return for investors, sealing the top spot in the researchers��� rankings. IOTA is an Internet of Things (IoT)-focused crypto platform that uses a so-called Tangle system. The protocol is different from blockchain, in that it does not use ���blocks��� or mining, but rather is built upon a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ��� a topologically ordered system in which different types of transactions run on different chains in the network simultaneously. CFC notes that the project is ���expected to reach 75 billion connected devices by 2025.��� In second place is Nxt, a blockchain-powered, decentralized ecosystem that focuses on crowdfunding, governance, cloud services and digital asset exchange. Investors in the project���s native NXT token saw returns of over 500,000 percent. Open-source blockchain platform Ethereum (ETH) ��� co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, who has characterized the project���s ambition as nothing short of becoming a ���world computer��� ��� ranks third, after bringing over 141,000 percent returns to its investors. Andrea-Franco St��hr, co-founder and CEO of CFC, said of the research findings: ���No project in the top ten had an ROI that was less than 6,000%���gains that are unfathomable for investors in many other markets. These numbers demonstrate the strong upside and myriad real-world applications for cryptocurrency. Also, the extreme success of infrastructure projects suggests investors should be seeking foundational companies that will redefine the internet in the next 10 to 15 years.���  ROI-Driven Crypto Research Findings.

The world���s largest investment company BlackRock has continued its bullish forecast for cryptocurrency, saying it sees ���wider use��� in the future in its weekly commentary report released Monday, Feb. 26. The investment management giant with $5.7 trln in assets under its control said that it would take time for cryptocurrency���s volatility to dissipate so it could enter traditional investment portfolios. ���Our bottom line: We see cryptocurrencies potentially becoming more widely used in the future as the markets mature,��� the report determined. ���Yet for now we believe they should only be considered by those who can stomach potentially complete losses.��� BlackRock stands out among fellow finance industry giants with its quietly supportive stance on Bitcoin and other crypto assets��� investment potential. As Cointelegraph reported late January, the corporation���s chief multi-asset strategist had gone public with comments that crypto was being kept under ���close review��� as an ���interesting development.��� Continued interest despite volatile periods, Isabelle Mateos Y Lago said, constituted proof there ���really is something to��� the phenomenon. The mood contrasts sharply with some other investment stalwarts. This month, Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger described Bitcoin as ���totally asinine��� and said investing in it was ���disgusting.��� On the topic of Blockchain meanwhile, BlackRock sees similar barriers to full global economy penetration. ���A blockchain-based, single shared financial database could eliminate inefficiencies and risks associated with human processes, but adoption at scale would require a massive shift in software development and a well-constructed maintenance model,��� it added. ���...Blockchain needs to overcome significant hurdles to reach its promising future.���	2
Bitcoin has fallen almost 12 percent in 24 hours as the reality of the Aug. 1 scaling deadline unsettles markets. Current trade prices according to Coinmarketcap, which averages readings from across major exchanges, shows Bitcoin at $2,076 - its lowest price for two months. The knock-on effects for altcoins in the top 10 were as palpable as ever, with Ethereum, Litecoin and others following Bitcoin downhill. Ethereum has fared particularly badly over the past week, with monthly losses to its market cap now nearly $18 bln. As always, internal reactions with cryptocurrency were mixed, some despairing while others are eyeing a keen buying opportunity. $5.5million of new $BTCUSD short positions have opened up within the last 12hrs on Bitfinex While a general consensus points to the upcoming hard fork probability as the principal motivation for market uncertainty, mainstream media have been quick to sound the alarm about Bitcoin once again. ���Rival factions of computer whizzes who play key roles in Bitcoin���s upkeep are poised to adopt two competing software updates at the end of the month,��� Bloomberg reported Friday, announcing Bitcoin could be ���nearing a total meltdown.��� ���That has raised the possibility that Bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the $41 bln market.���	0
Coinbase, a major US-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet platform, faces a class action lawsuit claiming that its employees and other insiders benefited from trading on non-public information that the exchange planned to introduce Bitcoin Cash (BCH) support last December, The Recorder Law reported on Friday, March 2. The complaint was filed by Coinbase user and Arizona citizen Jeffrey Berk, represented by two law firms, in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on Thursday, March 1. The introduction to the class action complaint brought against Coinbase explains that it is being made: ���on behalf of all Coinbase customers who placed purchase, sale or trade orders with Coinbase��� during the period of December 19, 2017 through and including December 21, 2017... and who suffered monetary loss as a result of Defendants��� wrongdoing.��� In the lawsuit, the plaintiff accuses Coinbase of ���artificially inflated prices��� by means of disclosing buy and sell orders moments after Coinbase launched BCH support on Dec. 19, 2017. The move may have caused the price of the cryptocurrency to soar by over 130 percent ��� from $1,865 on Dec. 18 it reached as high as $4,300 by Feb. 20, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  BCH was launched in August 2017 as a hard fork from Bitcoin. The day it launched on Coinbase, senior manager Brian Armstrong published a blog post stating that Coinbase employees were subject to the company's trading policies, which applies to all trading activities on any platform and prohibits non-public information disclosure. ���Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter. If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies���������directly or indirectly���������I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action,��� Armstrong stated in his post. On Feb. 23, Coinbase officially informed around 13,000 ���high-transacting" customers that personal data from accounts would be turned over to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) following a legal order that is the result of an ongoing legal battle between the IRS and the crypto platform.	0
Bitcoin prices fell below $10,000 Thursday as a bear market reversed growth which saw BTC/USD achieve weekly highs of $11,675 March 5. Price data from Coinmarketcap shows Bitcoin losing around $400 in three hours to hit $9658, recovering slightly to trade around $9900 at press time.  Image source: Coinmarketcap The behavior continues what has become a pattern for BTC/USD over the past month, with upticks towards $12,000 encountering resistance before diving below $10,000, then repeating the cycle. As Cointelegraph reported previously, several analysts have warned that closing above $12,400 will be a decisive event for traders, but this will be difficult to achieve. One of them, Tone Vays, similarly urged caution this week when Bitcoin closed above its 50-day moving average price for the first time since January. Despite Bloomberg commenting on the event as being the technical signal Bitcoin bulls had been ���waiting for,��� Vays said there was still a chance prices could drop steeply to remain below the 50-day average as that level itself continued to drop. Separate news that prices may have been impacted considerably since all-time highs in December 2017 due to Mt. Gox Bitcoin sales continues to surface this week. Meanwhile, other previously standard behavior was broken, altcoin markets seeing mixed reactions to Bitcoin���s downward trend. Looking at assets tracked by Coin360, some remained stable (Ethereum Classic), some dropped less than BTC against the dollar (Ethereum, Ripple) while others posted bigger losses (Dash, Cardano, Monero).

While Bitcoin sceptics claim that Bitcoin is only used for speculation and has no actual uses, a New York preschool has shown that Bitcoin can be a convenient and successful method of payment. In an interview given by Marco Ciocca, the Chairman of The Montessori Schools in Flatiron and SoHo, to Business Insider, he explained that he had a few parents enquiring about the use of Bitcoin as a means to pay the tuition fees. We had probably a handful of parents who mentioned, Hey do you accept Bitcoin? I've got this Bitcoin. Can we pay tuition in Bitcoin? Since Marco had been following the Bitcoin space for the past few years and was aware of the advantages of using Bitcoin, including ease of payment, low fees and quick and speed of the transactions. Together with other members of the administration, Ciocca decided to add Bitcoin as a payment option. The school does not hold Bitcoins and uses a payment processor to receive fiat in their bank accounts. Hence they are not exposed to Bitcoin's price volatility. While the exchange does charge them a 1% fee to process transactions, this pales in comparison to the fees charged by credit card companies. Moreover, credit cards can get declined, which leads to additional fees. Therefore, the school does not accept credit card payments. Apart from Bitcoin, the school accepts cash, cheques and electronic wires. Yeah, there's about a 1% transaction fee, which is less than, you know, 2, 3, 4% sometimes with credit cards. A lot of them get declined and then you have more fees and then you have to re-charge them and that's been kind of, sort of a headache for schools. Many companies have made news recently by adding Bitcoin as a payment option, but have found few customers willing to pay with the digital currency. In this case, there are a handful of parents who have paid tuition fees using Bitcoins. Since there are parents who have a career in the Blockchain space, they were open to the idea of making payments using Bitcoins. From the school's point of view, they were just offering an additional and convenient payment option to the parents. Bitcoin is not the exclusive preserve of futuristic businesses; even brick and mortar schools can adopt it	0
Binance.US, United States branch of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced that the opening of accounts registration, scheduled for Wednesday, will not include New York, Washington, Florida and 10 more states. According to the blog post published on Sept. 17, registration will start at 8 a.m. ET on Sept. 18 in most U.S. states, excluding the following: Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont and Washington. The post continues: ���Although it is upsetting that we cannot offer Binance.US in [these] states [...] at this time, please rest assured that this is just the beginning, and it is our mission to bring access to those of you in these states many of us call home.��� Once the registration process started, Binance.US will begin accepting inbound transfers of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Ripple���s XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT) and USD ���upon appropriate account verification.��� Additionally, according to the announcement, there would be no trading fees until Nov. 1. It is also noted that trades on Binance.US will be separate from Binance.com since the former is a separate company, operated by BAM Trading Services. U.S. users��� digital assets will also be stored in Binance.US wallets. As Cointelegraph reported on Sept 11, the 24-hour trading volume of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance���s futures markets has exceeded $150 million denominated in USDT.	2
A former iced tea and lemonade manufacturing company, Long Island Iced Tea, is investing in Bitcoin mining machinery. This move comes after the company watched its stock price jump 500% following a name change to Long Blockchain. The company made the name change two weeks ago, capitalizing on the Blockchain euphoria sweeping the globe. The company has announced that it will offer 1.6 mln shares at $5.25 per share, hoping to raise $8.4 mln. The company���s press release indicated that the stock sale would allow the company to move into the Bitcoin mining business. "The Cryptocurrency mining equipment expected to ship in January 2018 for immediate deployment in experienced Nordic Data Center. This mining equipment is manufactured by Bitmain. Agreement with certain third parties to purchase 1,000 Antminer S9 mining rigs and 1,000 APW3++ PSUs.��� Other companies have also seen massive stock price increases on relatively unimpressive news related to cryptocurrencies. For example, Longfin, a small cap stock, recently exploded in value - rising more than 1,300 percent - after announcing it would buy a defunct cryptocurrency. Other industry experts agree that euphoria is gripping the industry, though they see the potential for real Blockchain use cases to continue to gain momentum. Dominik Schiener Co-Founder of IOTA told Cointelegraph: "The entire market as it stands today, is in a bubble with more than a few dozen projects having reached unicorn valuation. This obviously won't last long, as 2018 will be a year where we will see a major consolidation happening, with every project having to prove its merit not just to the market, but also to the public. After all, only the projects with real-world adoption and true value will prevail."	1
The BitPay payment processor has announced its integration with the ShapeShift exchange to provide instant Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash trades. This announcement was made in a blog post Thursday, Jan. 18. The new partnership allows users to conduct exchanges between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in the BitPay and Copay wallets. US-based Bitpay was founded in 2011 and is one the largest international Bitcoin payment gateways. ShapeShift is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that focuses on instant trades between a number of cryptocurrencies. The integration allowed users to ���shift" between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash instantly, increasing the level of integration between the two coins��� markets. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin launched on Aug. 1, 2017 in order to increase the size limit of the Blockchain blocks and, by extension, the number of transactions that can be processed by the network every minute. Since its launch, BCH has been adopted by a number of major digital currency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken, ShapeShift and others.	2
Bank of America analysts have slammed Bitcoin as "exceptionally volatile", "impractical" and an environmentally disastrous asset that's useless as a store of wealth or an inflation hedge. For good measure the report also asserted the cryptocurrency is an impractical method of payment as it can only handle 1,400 transactions per hour compared to the 236 million transactions processed by Visa. The research note ��� which echoes the hardline stance taken against crypto by traditional financial institutions in years past ��� is in stark contrast to other major banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which have since embraced Bitcoin as an asset. Contradicting the notion that Bitcoin���s fixed supply of 21 million will inevitably drive price growth over time, the report argues BTC���s price is driven by supply and demand ��� asserting that because the supply is fixed, fluctuating demand is the only thing driving the price. Lead author Francisco Blanch (a team of nine other strategists contributed to the report) also dismissed the idea that Bitcoin is a safe haven asset. ���Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism,��� the Bank of America researcher stated. Given many investors are mainly concerned with returns, Bitcoin's track record of appreciation as the best performing asset over the past ten years may see them dismiss such criticisms. However, perceptions about Bitcoin���s negative environmental impact may pose a threat to increasing corporate and institutional adoption, as it conflicts with the 'triple bottom line' accounting that climate conscious shareholders are increasingly focused on. BoA states that Bitcoin has a higher carbon footprint than any other human activity in terms of dollar-for-dollar inflows, with the report estimating that Bitcoin's energy usage has grown more than 200% in the past two years and is now comparable to the Netherlands, Greece and the Czech Republic. While Bitcoiners often cite figures suggesting that between 39% and 76% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy, BoA's report asserts that in fact three quarters of BTC mining occurs in China where more than half of electricity is produced by coal. Further, it states half of all Chinese mining occurs in Xinjiang province where 80% of power comes from coal. (This ignores the seasonal migration of miners to Sichuan to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power during the rainy season. Coinshares estimates that it's actually miners in the Sichuan province that account for 50%-66% of global hashrate.)  BoA states that rising prices drive up mining difficulty which inexorably adds to Bitcoin mining���s carbon output. BoA calculated that a $1 billion investment in Bitcoin produces the same carbon emissions as 1.2 million petrol powered cars over the course of a year ��� which means Tesla's $1.5 billion investment is equivalent to adding 1.8 million petrol powered cars onto the roads each year, undermining the electric car maker's environmental credentials. And retail 'wholecoiners' weren't spared from environmental blame with the analyst claiming:  "A single Bitcoin purchase at a price of ~$50,000 has a carbon footprint of 270 tons, the equivalent of 60 ICE [petrol] cars." Leaving no criticism alone, Blanch also noted 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around "money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy" and that Central Bank Digital Currencies also pose tremendous long term threats to Bitcoin.  It���s worth noting the BoA report mainly documents the view of a single analyst and opinions vary within large organizations. Even at the overall pro-Bitcoin Goldman Sachs, some divisions have made similar criticisms of Bitcoin, while other divisions talk up Bitcoin as the future.  It���s clients may also disagree with the analysis. Bank of America���s January fund manager survey found that going 'long Bitcoin' was the 'most crowded trade' of the month. This article has been updated to note the report was produced by a team of strategists.	1
The French stock market regulator, The Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), announced in a press release that they have added 15 cryptocurrency and crypto-asset investment websites to a blacklist on March 15. According to the press release, the companies listed ran afoul of the ���Sapin II Law���, stating that: ���The investment proposals highlighting the possibility of financial returns or similar economic effects involve intermediation in miscellaneous assets and are now subject to ex ante control by the AMF. Consequently, no offer can be directly marketed in France without prior allocation by the AMF of a registration number.��� The press release then lists 15 offending companies, who continued to advertise and market their services as investment opportunities to the French public, despite new regulations. The blacklist also contains businesses that unlawfully offered investments in commodities like rare earth metals, wine, and diamonds. The statement reminds consumers that ���no advertising materials should make you overlook the fact that high returns always involve high risk.��� It further advises consumers to by duly diligent before making an investment, to learn as much as one can about the company or intermediary, and to only invest in a product one understands. This move by French regulators follows a pattern of suspicious attitudes toward cryptocurrencies from the French government. In December of last year, the Governor of the Bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, issued a warning on the high risks of investing in Bitcoin, claiming it is a speculative asset, and neither a currency or a digital currency. In January, France���s Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire appointed Jean-Pierre Landau, an open Bitcoin critic, to head a task force to examine cryptocurrency regulation. Landau has called Bitcoin the ���tulips of modern times��� in reference to Tulip Mania, which swept Europe in the early 17th century.	0
The debate on the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto promises to be a never-ending one. After a former SpaceX intern blogged that Elon Musk is probably Satoshi, Musk clarified that he is in fact not the creator of Bitcoin.  People have speculated about Satoshi's origins ever since Bitcoin was invented. The trigger to get the rumour mills rolling this time was a blog post by Sahil Gupta, former intern at SpaceX, who blogged that Elon Musk was probably Satoshi Nakamoto. Sahil uses Elon Musk's background in Economics, experience in production level software and history of innovation to speculate that Elon Musk 'probably' invented Bitcoin. Given the divisive nature of the blocksize debate in the Bitcoin community, Sahil sought Elon's (or Satoshi's) intervention and asks him to play the role of a founding father (similar to Vitalik Buterin in Ethereum).   Elon Musk, has however, denied that he was Satoshi Nakamoto and going on to add that he had lost the Bitcoins which were sent to him a few years back.   Elon Musk tweeted  Not true. A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don���t know where it is.    There has been chatter on social media in the past about whether Elon Musk could be Satoshi, but nothing ever came of the talk. Musk���s earlier stated views on Bitcoin were not flattering. In an earlier interview, Elon Musk had said:   "I guess it is primarily going to be a means of doing illegal transactions. That is not necessarily entirely bad.  Maybe some things shouldn't be illegal.... You should have a legal to illegal bridge."    Previous hunts for Satoshi Nakamoto have not ended well. Craig Wright claimed in 2016 that he was Satoshi and managed to convince a few mainstream media organizations and Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, before his claim was debunked.   In 2014, Newsweek���s cover story claimed that the magazine had uncovered the identity of Satoshi. They speculated that an engineer named Dorian Nakamoto was actually the creator of Bitcoin. A media frenzy followed, despite Dorian Nakamoto���s repeated denials that he wasn't Satoshi. Eventually the Newsweek story was debunked, the magazine was left with egg on its face and Dorian Nakamoto���s life was turned completely upside down, bringing great financial hardship to the man.   Various people from Hal Finney to Nick Szabo were thought to have been Satoshi at various points in time, but nobody knows for sure. Many still believe that Satoshi is actually a group of people rather than a single individual.   While Bitcoin has grown organically and drawn millions of users into its fold without the active involvement of Satoshi, questions will always remain about his identity. Nonetheless, the development of the Bitcoin protocol has proceeded apace without Satoshi, given the talented developers who work on Bitcoin and significant community support.   However, if Satoshi is still alive and if he still holds his private keys, he is believed to own about one million Bitcoins. With Bitcoin having just breached the $10,000 level, that gives Satoshi a net worth, on paper, of $10 bln. Given that many believe Satoshi no longer has control over the coins, if he ever decided to sell his Bitcoins, the price of Bitcoins might plunge.   Given that Satoshi has remained out of the limelight for so long, it does seem likely that he values his privacy more than the billions that his Bitcoins are worth. Then again, with Bitcoin���s epic bull run, nobody knows at what point the mysterious founder might change his mind.	1
Swedish computer programmer Alexander Bottema has multiplied his life savings over one hundred fold in the last four years. He first invested in Bitcoin in 2013, when the digital currency was priced at only $30. Bottema realized that Bitcoin had huge potential and sold all his stocks and liquidated his savings in order to purchase as much of the digital currency as possible. Bottema has not sold any of his holdings, even as the price of Bitcoin has flirted with $4500 in recent days. In an interview with Business Insider, the Bitcoin investor says: ���I consider it a retirement insurance. I���m not thinking about buying any more, since I can never get the same return on investment again. I could consider selling some of my assets should the price hit 100,000 dollars.��� Bottema was raised in a small community near Stockholm in Sweden and learned to program on his family���s Apple II computer. He studied computer science at Uppsala University in 1991 and went on to earn his PhD. He returned in Stockholm where he began working in data security and encryption for consultancy Upec Industriteknik. When his employer was bought out, Bottema and his two colleagues established their own company called Polytrust. Today, Bottema is living in the US and working at Massachusetts-based Mathworks, a provider of data analysis and simulation for industrial applications. According to Bottema, he encountered Bitcoin for the first time in 2010. At first he wasn���t interested in the digital currency, believing it to be infeasible. However, he changed his mind after the price of Bitcoin crashed and eventually rebounded. Bottema says: ���I rejected it as something uninteresting. Seeing that I had a long track record in data security, I was certain that it wouldn���t be possible to build safe servers that are open, and envisioned a crash. The following year, I was sitting on the subway and read in the Metro newspaper how Bitcoin had recovered after a crash. I couldn���t understand how a currency that is built on trust could recover. That piqued my interest.���   Bottema is just one of the many so-called ���Bitcoinnaires��� who now have a high net worth due to their early investment in Bitcoin.	1
The former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has characterized Bitcoin (BTC) as ���a lottery ticket,��� in an article for major United Kingdom daily broadsheet The Guardian Dec. 10. Writing in the midst of the recent crypto market price collapse, current Harvard University Professor of Economics and Public Policy Kenneth Rogoff suggested that the ���overwhelming sentiment��� among crypto advocates is that the total ���market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies could explode over the next five years, rising to $5-10 [trillion].��� The historic volatility of the emerging asset class, he conceded, indeed indicates that Bitcoin���s decline from its all-time highs of $20,000 to under $3,500 earlier today is ���no reason to panic.��� Nonetheless, the economist dismissed the ���crypto evangelist��� view of Bitcoin as digital gold, calling it ���nutty,��� stating its long-term value is ���more likely to be $100 than $100,000.��� Rogoff argued that unlike physical gold, Bitcoin���s use is limited to transactions ��� making it purportedly more vulnerable to a bubble-like collapse. Additionally, the cryptocurrency���s energy-intensive verification process is ���vastly less efficient��� than systems that rely on ���a trusted central authority like a central bank.��� Even if Bitcoin should not necessarily be ���worth zero,��� Rogoff argued that national governments and ���regulators are gradually waking up to the fact that they cannot countenance large expensive-to-trace transaction technologies that facilitate tax evasion and criminal activity.��� This, in his view, places Bitcoin in a double bind, with implications for its future value: ���take away near-anonymity and no one will want to use it; keep it and advanced-economy governments will not tolerate it.��� While the economist noted that governments worldwide may in due time ���regulate and appropriate��� the innovations of the new asset class ������ as shown by the interest of multiple central banks in digital currency issuance ������ he argued that coorinatinated global regulation would eventually seek to ���stamp out privately constructed systems,��� with only certain geopolitical outliers as a possible exception: ���The right way to think about cryptocurrency coins is as lottery tickets that pay off in a dystopian future where they are used in rogue and failed states, or perhaps in countries where citizens have already lost all semblance of privacy. It is no coincidence that dysfunctional Venezuela is the first issuer of a state-backed cryptocurrency (the ���petro���).��� Rogoff���s argument that ���disgruntled��� nation states ������ Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Russia ������ are turning to cryptocurrencies under the burden of sanctions has been raised by multiple analysts previously. A report earlier this fall indicated that the government of North Korea was ���laundering��� crypto into fiat to evade U.S. sanctions. Iran is going one step further, exploring the creation of its own national cryptocurrency, according to a report this summer.	1
���Zen Master��� and Hollywood actor Steven Seagal has announced that he is the new brand ambassador for Bitcoiin2Gen (B2G), a new cryptocurrency that claims to be a ���superior or more advanced version of [Satoshi Nakamoto���s] Original Bitcoin���, in a tweet Feb. 20. Bitcoiin2Gen published a press release on Feb. 12 announcing that due to Seagal���s beliefs that ���the development of the physical self is essential to protect the spiritual man,��� the actor is ���obvious as brand ambassador��� for the new cryptocurrency, adding emphatically: ���Steven Seagal has become a believer of Bitcoiin2Gen.��� Bitcoiin2Gen uses the Ethereum Blockchain and a P2P payment system that is the same as Bitcoin���s, according to their website. Their whitepaper does not explain these systems, claiming doing so would be redundant, since ���it has done by Vitalik Buterin [...] and by Satoshi Nakamoto.��� The whitepaper���s ���About Bitcoiin2Gen��� section explains that the coin differs from Bitcoin in that it has ���its own eco-system, its own wallet, its own mining machines and the ability to exchange the coin to popular altcoins or fiat currencies.��� Actor and aikido black belt Seagal, the first foreigner to operate a aikido dojo in Japan, is known for his 90s films, ���Hard to Kill,��� ���Marked for Death,��� and ���Out for Justice.��� He allegedly got his first role in a Hollywood film after putting on an aikido demonstration for the Warner brothers. Seagal has also dabbled in music, releasing an album in 2007 entitled, ���Songs from the Crystal Cave.��� His more recent movies include ���The Asian Connection,��� "The Perfect Weapon," "End of a Gun," "Contract to Kill," and "China Salesman." Seagal tweeted his involvement in the new cryptocurrency only yesterday, Feb. 20, which coincided with the release of another Bitcoiin2Gen press release on ���clarify[ing] allegations��� made by Coindesk, TNW, CNET, Mashable, Business Insider, and Fortune that accused the cryptocurrency of being a pyramid scheme, scam, and MLM company. In an attempt to dispel fears of any association they might have with a pyramid scheme, Bitcoiin2Gen responded to the media���s allegations by elaborating that their four level pyramid-like commission structure, where potential investors can earn money by promoting B2G by word of mouth, will only exist during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO).  The B2G ICO was launched in January 2018 and the official launch of the cryptocurrency is scheduled for March, 2018. The B2G white paper reveal predictions for the coin���s price to hit $388 per coin by December. The Feb. 20 press release writes that there ���shouldn���t be any problem if Mr. Steven Seagal is promoting a cryptocurrency,��� as it is normal for celebrities to promote brands. The company adds that: ���Nobody should link this endorsement as investment advice as neither he nor we ever advised so.��� Although Bitcoiin2Gen admits that Seagal���s endorsement has brought them popularity, the company also insists ���most assuredly Bitcoiin2Gen���s being self-sufficient coin is the only reason enthusiasts are participating in ICO or becoming part of the Bitcoiin2Gen���. The press release concludes confidently: ���To summarize, we would like to inform the community that we are not an MLM company or a Pyramid Scheme or any Scam.��� Twitter user Jonathan Matias commented on Seagal���s tweet announcing his brand ambassadorship: ���Damnit Steven I was just about to Tweet you to warn you that someone was using your name and likeness to promote some Sh***coin without you knowing, and here we are. Dump this and run!" Damnit Steven I was just about to Tweet you to warn you that someone was using your name and likeness to promote some Shitcoin without you knowing, and here we are. Dump this and run! Quick before you become the next Bitconnect Carlos!	1
Developer Samuel Dobson announced via a series of tweets on Thursday night that he is stepping down as a Bitcoin Core maintainer after three years as he ���can no longer dedicate the time required, as I approach the end of my Ph.D.��� I am officially stepping down as a maintainer of Bitcoin Core.Serving as the wallet maintainer for the past three years has been an absolute privilege, and I want to thank my incredibly generous sponsor John Pfeffer (@jlppfeffer) for his support throughout. /1 As a Bitcoin Core wallet maintainer, Dobson had direct access to the cryptocurrency's code on GitHub, with permissions to approve changes and make improvements to the Bitcoin software. He was also responsible for ensuring the security of the protocol. When asked if there���s a chance that he will come back to BTC Core development one day, Dobson answered Cointelegraph that his Ph.D. is his primary focus at the moment. And even though he hasn���t decided what he will do upon graduation, he is not interested in the development of other cryptocurrencies. Dobson stated that he is particularly grateful for the support of his ���incredibly generous sponsor��� John Pfeffer, without which he would not have been able to prioritize working on Bitcoin part-time. He made an appeal to the Twitter community to consider financially supporting a developer due to the nature of open source projects. He also told Cointelegraph: Bitcoin has already lost two maintainers since October. With Dobson's departure, the number of developers with direct access to Bitcoin code has dropped to five, according to an updated list on the Bitcoin Forum.	0
Trading firm Jane Street Capital, which reportedly trades an average of $13 bln daily in equities across the globe, has included Bitcoin (BTC) in its traded assets, Business Insider reported today, March 17. A statement from the company reads: ���Jane Street trades over 56,000 products globally across a wide variety of asset classes, including Bitcoin.��� Unnamed sources told Business Insider that Jane Street, which was founded in 2000, only entered into crypto trading last year. The company���s website reports that $5.6 trln was traded across all products in 2017. In February 2016, the company was described by the New York Times as a ���secretive��� ETF firm. While the profit numbers for Jane Street���s Bitcoin trading are not public, the company has noted that it will stay open to further involvement in the crypto markets: "Jane Street has always taken a considered approach to trading opportunities and will continue to do so. As more cryptocurrency products emerge, we expect to be involved." Other Wall Street investors have also already jumped onto the crypto bandwagon. Major American investor Bill Miller told reporters in December 2017 that he had invested a whopping half of his hedge fund���s money in Bitcoin.	2
Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has tabled a proposal to preserve the Terra ecosystem following the historic depegging of its algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and the resulting death spiral that plunged Terra (LUNA) tokens to practically zero.  In a Friday post on Terra���s research forum, Kwon said, ���The Terra community must reconstitute the chain to preserve the community and the developer ecosystem.��� His proposal, which was in response to validator groups discussing the possibility of forking the Terra chain, involves compensating UST and LUNA holders who were unable or unwilling to sell their holdings during this week���s price collapse.  Kwon proposed that validators should reset network ownership to 1 billion tokens distributed among LUNA and UST holders as well as a community pool to fund future development. Specifically, 40% of the newly distributed tokens would go toward LUNA holders who held the asset before the depegging event; 40% would go towards UST holders on a pro-rata basis at the time of the new network upgrade; 10% would be allocated to LUNA holders just before the chain halted operations and the remaining 10% would go toward the development pool. Regarding UST ever being repegged to the United States dollar, Kwon said it likely wouldn't make a difference given the mass liquidity events across the Terra ecosystem this week. In other words, trust in the stablecoin model has been eroded permanently. He explained: At its height in early April, LUNA's market cap was over $41 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The value of Terra's UST, which can no longer be referred to as a stablecoin, peaked at almost $19 billion. After losing parity with the dollar, UST crashed to a low of around $0.13 on Friday.  Although there's no way to fully restore the blockchain's value, Kwon said the redistribution plan has to compensate the network's debt holders and "loyal community members and builders." Kwon's proposal was submitted roughly two days after he published a plan to save UST's dollar peg, which involved increasing the special drawing rights pool and expanding the protocol's minting capacity. The plan failed to win favor among the community of so-called "LUNAtics," as the price of LUNA and its sister token continued to plummet.	1
Bitcoin futures are down as the world���s largest futures market, CME Group, opens trading. Immediately after trading began, Bitcoin futures contracts closing in January jumped to $20,800 before falling to $18,800 at press time. Contracts expiring in February, March and June are still priced at $20,000. Considering Bitcoin���s current spot price of $18,500, Wall Street still seems mildly bullish. Of course, no mainstream media report on the price of Bitcoin would be complete without the use of clickbait terms such as ���bearish��� or ���bubble.��� The Telegraph reported on the drop, using the headline ���price falls after investors turn bearish.��� This is despite the fact that a 4% drop is absolutely miniscule in the cryptocurrency world. Likewise, BBC reported on the opening of CME���s market, reporting that acceptance onto the massive exchange brings Bitcoin a step closer to mainstream adoption. Of course, BBC felt it necessary to immediately follow their statement with a quote from UBS Chairman Axel Weber giving his opinion that ���Bitcoin is not money.��� There is a significant contrast in the market���s reaction to CME���s futures and its 19% gain after the opening of CBOE futures last week. However, it���s useful to realize that Bitcoin had dropped by thousands of dollars in the days before CBOE trading opened, so a significant gain shouldn���t have been surprising. CME futures launched following most exchanges hitting an all-time high Bitcoin price yesterday, so a small drop from these new highs is hardly dramatic. There are many theories on what comes next for Bitcoin following the opening of CME���s market. While there are reasonable arguments for the possibility of investors shorting the contracts, investors should remember ���the trend is your friend.��� Even Bitcoin-hater and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that the currency could hit $100,000 before ���collapsing.��� Following Dimon���s assessment of Bitcoin as a ���fraud��� earlier this year, Swedish firm Blockswater filed a formal ���market abuse report��� with European regulators. The company alleges that Dimon knew his statements were inaccurate and was intentionally trying to influence the Bitcoin markets with his remarks.	0
Niklas Nikolajsen, the founder of Swiss crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse, predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) once the Ethereum (ETH) network has proved the algorithm���s success. Bitcoin���s current Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm ��� the pioneering concept which in fact pre-existed Bitcoin, but has since come to be indissociable from the cryptocurrency ��� ���will probably change in the future,��� Nikolajsen argued. In outtakes from an interview conducted for a German TV documentary ��� recorded back in October 2019, but uploaded on April 6 ��� Nikolajsen said: ���[Bitcoin���s move to Proof-of-Stake] is not planned, but the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether, will move to a Proof-of-Stake concept that demands vastly less electricity, already in a few months. I���m sure, once the technology is proven, that Bitcoin will adapt to it as well.��� ���Once it���s proven that Proof-of-Stake works well, it���s a superior system to Proof-of-Work,��� he said. In blockchains that use a PoS system, nodes in the network engage in validating blocks, rather than mining them, as in PoW.  For PoS, a deterministic algorithm selects block validators based on the number of tokens a given node has staked in their wallet ��� i.e. deposited as collateral in order to compete to add the next block to the chain. Nikolajsen's prediction that Bitcoin will eventually migrate to a PoS system was made in the context of a discussion of the notoriously high levels of electricity needed to sustain mining on the current network. He dismissed claims that mining Bitcoin consumes levels of electricity comparable to small nations and also emphasized that mining's energy-intensity is less of an issue than where that energy is produced and how sustainably it is generated.  Moreover, the energy consumption of producing gold ��� Bitcoin���s proverbial predecessor ��� must be equally acknowledged, Nikolajsen states, as does that in the existing banking system and tech industry: ���Which metropolis in the world doesn���t have 100-story-high banking towers, glowing in a million different colors all night, and their financial systems, their computers, server rooms. How much energy does Facebook consume? They have 21 huge data centers worldwide, I���d say probably more than Bitcoin. The banking system for sure consumes a lot more energy.��� The common perception that high energy consumption is an ���Achilles Heel��� for Bitcoin has been critiqued by some proponents of clean energy, who, like Nikolajsen, place an emphasis on the sources of power, rather than levels of consumption. Beyond the energy problem, the PoS vs. PoW debate engages questions of economic fairness, barriers to entry, network security and decentralization.	2
This is a tale of two Bitcoins. After a fork in August that created Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), we have reached yet another crossroad. While another hardfork was planned around middle of November to boost Bitcoin���s block size, this fork is now dead in the water. The lack of consensus among the Bitcoin community was cited as the reason for abandoning the so-called SegWit2x plan. Abandoning the fork lifted the Bitcoin price from $7,200 to $7,800 as traders realized their worst fears (an ugly chain split) would be avoided. However, excitement hasn���t lasted. Bitcoin is now trading at around $6,000 at press time, as traders and investors fear that SegWit by itself will not create enough capacity to scale. Indeed, at the time of this writing, there are over 140,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin Cash was the surprise winner in all of this, at least temporarily. The currency which had been drifting steadily downward was lifted as high as $2,600 in a dramatic pump following the news of SegWit2x���s cancellation. While the price has since experienced a 50% retrace, spectators were stunned at the sudden rise. The lack of a clear path for Bitcoin���s scaling issues are having a serious impact on Bitcoin���s price. As more users discover Bitcoin and its popularity increases, there is a growing danger that it will be a victim of its own success. We talked with Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Input Output Hong Kong, who elaborated the challenge facing Bitcoin: ���Bitcoin is at an existential crisis where it has grown large enough and attracted enough quality people to provide very clear yet different roadmaps for the future backed by passion, money and brilliance. From one perspective this creates friction and has resulted in splits. From another we get to see in parallel both philosophies play out in real time and compete for market share.In the end it's impossible to say who will win, but this is predictable sign of maturity rather than a symptom of chaos. No ecosystem can keep everyone happy nor can it satisfy divergent visions. So they have to find a way to split like so many open source projects before then without destroying the value already accumulated and the underlying communities.��� Bitcoin���s high prices may have drawn users like bees to honey but many are likely not savvy. There is a high degree of confusion among these users that is making matters worse. A lot of them can���t probably tell the two Bitcoins apart from each other. We talked with Fran Strajnar, CEO of Bravenewcoin, who thinks we are going through yet another round of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). He tells us: ���I think the current FUD is very confusing to the millions of new people pouring into the crypto space for the first time.  'Bitcoin,' 'Bitcoin-Cash' is enough to confuse people as it is.��� Altcoins are no stranger to the phenomenon of pump and dump. There are people out there who have the ability to increase the price of a particular coin and when there is enough buzz around a coin, it is simply the matter of dumping it and making a neat profit. Kumar Gaurav, chairman of Auxesis Group and founder of Cashaa has this to say on the recent increase in BCH (BCC) prices: ���The quick rise [of BCH] from around 600 to 2400 USD in a few days makes it look like a typical artificial pump which was already being followed by a dump back to $1300 USD within 30 min. As compared to the FX market, the crypto market is still small, it is easy to do that and can not be used to estimate the future of BTC vs BCC.��� Gaurav is of the view that Bitcoin has gained relative maturity with the passage of time: ���Compared to that, Bitcoin has already overcome many challenges, keeps following its pattern of steady rise and its current downwards push is one of the many only temporary ones such as in July and September this year, so we can expect it to be back on the way to 8000 USD soon, whereas [BCH] is too new to estimate whether it will grow in the long term or whether the current move was one of the typical altcoins��� pump and dumps.��� Fran also adds his voice: ���However I expect Bitcoin to be 'just fine' if it stays above $4500 as the smart money realizes that BCH has no advantage, support or adoption like BTC has.��� The good news is that as more people discover cryptocurrencies, there is space for both flavours of Bitcoin to exist and prosper. As for the bickering within the Bitcoin community, you can���t really rule out more forks or more Bitcoin variants in the future either. This is just the way cryptocurrencies are. As Hoskinson puts it: ���Bitcoin Cash seems to be a productive split with its existence neither threatening Bitcoin's nor requiring support from Bitcoin's remaining adherents. Now Bitcoin is free to provide it's small block vision and cash the large block. My hope is that this will reduce fighting in the long run as both sides realize that the other isn't going away. Just like we did with Ethereum and Ethereum classic.��� Perhaps democracy is the biggest winner and a byproduct of cryptocurrencies, and that is the silver lining.	0
Bitcoin (BTC) has spent almost 900 days correcting from its $20,000 all-time highs ��� but its trip to $100,000 is about to start. That is the opinion of popular social media trader and analyst Credible Crypto, who on May 29 declared that the largest cryptocurrency���s 896-day climbdown would soon be over. According to an accompanying chart, the time since December 2017 has been ���one massive accumulation phase,��� during which investors repositioned themselves and bought in. This ���consolidation structure,��� as Credible Crypto calls it, is now ripe for disintegration, to give way to a new bull run which will obliterate the $20,000 zone.  He wrote in comments: The last 896 days were simply one massive re-accumulation phase before the run to 100k+ #bitcoin, and the consolidation structure will soon be broken. Are you prepared? Despite wobbling around the halving and after, the Bitcoin price has entirely erased losses from its March crash, which Credible Crypto notes formed a ���higher low��� compared to the peak of the bear market in December 2018. That cycle of ���higher lows��� itself positions the market for upside, the chart suggests.  BTC/USD 3-year chart showing ���consolidation structure.��� Source: Positive Crypto/ Twitter As Cointelegraph reported, various analysts are now convinced that after this month���s block subsidy halving, a bullish trend will kick in for Bitcoin within the next one-to-two years at most. Perhaps most daringly, PlanB���s stock-to-flow model predicts a $288,000 price tag by 2024, with all-time highs easily being two times that ��� $576,000 per Bitcoin. Network indicators are also providing food for thought. Sixty percent of the Bitcoin supply, for example, has not moved in a year or more, a trend which has stayed the same for five months, despite wildly varied price performance. Bitcoin���s position in its current so-called ���hodl wave,��� supply data says, has triggered bull runs in every previous cycle.  Selling appears low on investors��� list of priorities ��� exchange reserves are now at their lowest since December 2018.	0
After Bitcoin hit $6,000 and stayed above it Monday, the virtual currency���s most famous fans are confident $10,000 will involve little effort. Mixed messages are accounting for Bitcoin���s sudden second surge above the $6,000 mark, with Max Keiser pointing to a combination of factors for underlying support. 30,000 new #Bitcoin wallets a day. ETF coming soon. Wall St. just getting started. Regulators waking up to their impotence. Hello $10,000!

Keiser meanwhile remains steadfast in his prediction of an easy ride to $10,000 per Bitcoin, reiterating his long-term target since 2011 being ten times that - $100,000. Anyone who thinks otherwise, he wrote on Twitter Monday, ���has not been paying attention.��� Bitcoin prices reached a new all-time high of $6,300 Sunday before tailing off to hover around $6,110 at press time. The move dragged altcoin markets along with it, with the top ten seeing 24-hour gains of up to 6.6 percent. Bitcoin Cash, too, has achieved multi-week highs with its Sunday trading price of $475 at its highest since mid-September.	1
A rising tide lifts all boats ��� even those previously thought to be shipwrecked. At least that���s how it looked on Wednesday when some previously dormant altcoins erupted back to life, experiencing spikes ranging between 3,000% and 6,500% for the week.  Foremost among them was Karma (KARMA), a social media project that originally launched on the EOS blockchain in 2018. Over the past seven days, the dollar value of Karma increased 6,530% as the token climbed from a subcent price of $0.000464 up to $0.030767. Trade volume spiked 35,400% over the same period, but don���t assume that means liquidity is readily available. From a weekly low of $2, trade volume had risen to the heady heights of $710 by Wednesday. The token had lost more than 99% of its value between 2018 and 2020, and that���s the same year that any activity was last witnessed from the project���s Twitter account. Karma���s Telegram channel predictably saw numerous new additions in the past week, but no news from the team has been forthcoming. Karma migrated from the EOS blockchain to Worldwide Asset eXchange in 2019, and the last announcement on social media relates to the token���s integration with a WAX cloud wallet. The WAX Protocol Token (WAXP) itself gained 348% during the past month alone as it successfully rode the wave of NFT mania. This week���s other reawakened altcoin, Nestree (EGG), has recorded a 3,018% surge over the past seven days, climbing from $0.005511 up to $0.171872. Over half of that spike occurred in a five-minute window early on Wednesday morning, suggesting a less than natural price movement. Over 96% of the token���s $7 million trade volume came from the South Korean exchange Bithumb, where trades against the Korean won were dominant.  Nestree launched in 2019 and is described as a rewards-based blockchain messenger. The project���s Twitter account became less active over time, with four posts in 2020 being followed by just one so far in 2021. The latest announcement was a very brief ���roadmap��� that gave vague details on the development of an e-commerce website. Over 10,000 installs of the Nestree app have been recorded on the Google Play store, but reviews mention that certain personal data, including a mobile phone number, is required to sign up. One reviewer noted, ���This goes against the spirit of blockchain based chat apps.��� As suggested by the above figures, the cryptocurrency market does not always discriminate.

Sergio Dermain Lerner, a researcher known for looking at the mining patterns of the original Bitcoin (BTC) miner, has turned his attention on the Bitcoin blocks mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. Lerner made a preview of his latest findings available to Cointelegraph. His research is based on the irregular pattern of the Least-Significant-Byte (LSB) of the nonce field of block.  This past June, Lerner published a blog that expanded on his original research from 2013. He suggested that for an unknown reason, Satoshi refrained from mining in the first five minutes of the block interval. Other researchers have also expanded on Lerner's research. TechMiX showed that all the blocks mined by Satoshi could be grouped into five baskets, based on the frequency distribution of the Nonce LSB values.  Nonce LSB value. Source: TechMiX. A nonce gets incremented with every new attempt to solve a mining puzzle. Apparently, Satoshi's equipment was not using the entire available nonce space, only focusing on a limited range. Lerner's latest research indicates that Satoshi was decrementing the nonce value instead:  This leads to a more interesting conclusion that perhaps will put an end to the discussion about the type of equipment that Satoshi Nakamoto used:  If Lerner's conclusions are correct that would lend more credence to the hypothesis that Satoshi Nakamoto was a single person and not a team. This would also put another nail into Craig Wright's claims of being a Bitcoin creator as he has indicated numerous times that he used dozens of computers to mine the early blocks.	1
Bitcoin���s price seems to have stalled below $60,000 after attaining new all-time highs earlier in March. PlanB, a crypto analyst active on Twitter, thinks Bitcoin (BTC) may still have a lot of room to gallup however.  ���IMO we are only ~4 months into the bull market and nowhere near the end of it,��� PlanB tweeted on Friday. ���Bitcoin is just getting started,��� he added, showing Bitcoin���s current path on one of his Stock-to-Flow charts. Multiple Stock-to-Flow models exist for Bitcoin which show Bitcoin���s price path in line with its halving events and supply over time. YouTuber and derivatives trader Tone Vays also carries a bullish macro view, although he thinks a dip lower for Bitcoin is not out of the question.  ���Bitcoin is consolidating but I remain bullish in this market,��� Vays told Cointelegraph. ���While it is still possible for bitcoin to make a lower low for the month in the $48k range, I believe we will go up to above $70k before June,��� he added.  After trading past $61,000 this month, Bitcoin retraced down near $50,000. For the most part, the drop occurred over roughly two weeks, with some relief bounces mixed in, rather than in a straight, single-day $10,000 shot downward. Based on TradingView data, BTC holds a price of $54,550 at time of publication, looking back on a day of overall upward price action.  Meanwhile, other crypto assets continue to make headlines in the price category as well.	1
Russia central bank head Elvira Nabiullina has said it is ���categorically against��� regulating cryptocurrency money, or equating it with foreign currency. Speaking at a forum organized by a group of Russian banks, Nabiullina, who previously said she is against cryptocurrency appearing on the Moscow Stock Exchange, warned about so-called ���cryptomania��� occurring, which was ���dangerous.��� ���We are categorically against regulating cryptocurrencies as money, as a means by which payment can be made for goods and services, and against equating them with foreign currency,��� she stated via RIA Novosti. ���Because, as I���ve said more than once before, we understand there���s foreign currency, states which issue it, economics, central banks supporting it. Here the phenomenon (of cryptocurrency) is less understood.��� Russia continues to present a mixed perspective on how to regulate cryptoassets, with different prominent government sources giving contrasting views. At the forum, the situation appeared no different. Nabiullina commented that the central bank���s position was ���tougher��� than that held by the chairman of the organizing banking association, Anatoly Aksakov. Speaking earlier at the event, Aksakov said he favored ���legalizing, arriving at a definition of what cryptocurrency is, arranging a space in which it should be allowed to trade, introducing a register for miners etc.��� Nabiullina, for her part, made reference to a crypto ���gold rush��� earlier this month, which she said should be averted. Russia currently plans to present cryptocurrency regulation plans by the end of 2017. It remains to be seen what exact form these will take for ordinary citizens.	1
Former Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) governor Kevin Warsh thinks that the creation of a ���FedCoin��� in order to ���bring legal activities into a digital coin��� deserves serious consideration, The New York Times reported May 4. Kevin Warsh is an American financier who was governor at the Fed from 2006 to 2011. He was a top contender to become its chairman when the Trump administration chose Jerome Powell instead. Warsh said that if he had returned to the Federal Reserve, he would have formed a team ���to think about the Fed creating FedCoin, where we would bring legal activities into a digital coin.��� He stated: ���Not that it would supplant and replace cash, but it would be a pretty effective way when the next crisis happens for us to maybe conduct monetary policy.��� Warsh said that ���most central banks have a view that these crypto-assets are clever, like guys in the garage did it and it���s kind of cool, or risky,��� given the possibility for investor losses and widespread fraud. He reportedly noted that blockchain technology would deliver benefits to the Federal Reserve in terms of the payment systems it operates. This, according to Warsh, would enable the transfer of trillions of dollars between banks. Jerome Powell said that the Fed is actually looking at blockchain ���as something that may have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.��� According to Warsh, central banks should treat digital currencies as more than a novelty if people really believe to some extent that cryptocurrency is future of money: ���Congress gave the Fed a monopoly over money. And if the next generation of cryptocurrencies look more like money and less like gold ��� and have less volatility associated with them so they would be not just a speculative asset but could be a reliable unit of account ��� as a purely defensive matter I wouldn���t want somebody to take that monopoly from me.��� Some central banks are already moving forward with studies and tests on decentralized ledger technology. In March, the Bank of England announced it was undertaking a proof-of-concept study to understand whether the renewed Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service could be capable of interacting with blockchain. The European Central Bank completed research with the Bank of Japan on blockchain���s potential for transforming securities settlements. Recently, South Korea���s central bank announced it was considering cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications for its project for a ���cashless society.���	1
Dr. Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the University of Cambridge and the London School of Economics, explained in an interview with CNN that Bitcoin is nothing short of an economic miracle. Hileman stated: "Many economists dismissed it as a flawed form of money, something that could never achieve the level of adoption that it has. Today we estimate 5 to 10 million unique active users of cryptocurrencies, and in my opinion that's nothing short of a minor economic miracle." Bitcoin is the world���s first form of decentralized money; a store of value that is censorship-resistant and that is immutable against manipulation by central entities, authorities and governments. The decentralized structure and peer-to-peer protocol of Bitcoin are unique in that they allow the Bitcoin network to operate as its own economy, without intermediaries and third party service providers. While some central banks and financial institutions have begun to fear such aspects of Bitcoin, the Bank of Finland encouraged economists to study the ���marvelous structure��� of Bitcoin. In a paper entitled ���Monopoly without a monopolist: An economic analysis of the Bitcoin payment system,��� Bank of Finland researchers wrote: ���Bitcoin is not regulated. It cannot be regulated. There is no need to regulate it because as a system it is committed to the protocol as is and the transaction fees it charges the users are determined by the users independently of the miners��� efforts. Bitcoin���s design as an economic system is revolutionary and therefore would merit an economist���s attention and scrutiny even if it had not been functional. Its apparent functionality and usefulness should further encourage economists to study this marvelous structure.��� As mentioned above, Hileman described Bitcoin as an economic miracle, but a ���minor��� one. However, at this stage in which the market valuation of Bitcoin has surpassed that of major banks at $166 bln and the liquidity of Bitcoin is higher than that of most stock markets, it is difficult to justify any aspect of Bitcoin as ���minor.��� Bitcoin has had a major impact on the global financial system over the past eleven months, and it will continue to transform the finance industry at a rapid pace. Already, institutional investors have begun to move into the Bitcoin market. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that approximately $10 bln in institutional money are awaiting to be invested in digital currencies such as Bitcoin. ���Over 100 hedge funds have been created in the past year exclusively to trade digital currency. An even greater number of traditional institutional investors are starting to look at trading digital assets (including family offices, sovereign wealth funds, traditional hedge funds, and more). By some estimates there is $10 bln of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to invest in digital currency today,��� wrote Armstrong. Naturally, as major hedge funds and large-scale investment banks shift towards Bitcoin, general consumers and casual investors will follow. Then, Bitcoin will no longer be a minor economic miracle but a major one, which will inevitably shape the finance sector in the long-term. Leading economies like the US, Japan and South Korea have already recognized Bitcoin as a legal currency and store of value, providing regulations to cryptocurrency exchanges, businesses and investors.   As a currency, Hileman also noted that Bitcoin is increasingly being used in the luxury markets, to process or settle large transactions without the expensive and inefficient services of banks. "If you're only paying a $2 transaction fee on a piece of art that's worth tens of thousands, the fee is basically zero. But if you're paying two or three percent on a piece of art of that value, then the numbers can go up quite a bit,��� added Hileman.	1
The first half of the Ethereum Metropolis hard fork, nicknamed Byzantium, is happening on Monday at some point between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC. The fork is scheduled to take place at block number 4,370,000. For those interested in watching the fork take place live, a countdown clock can be found here. The much anticipated hard fork contains a number of updates to the Ethereum chain including an addition of ���REVERT��� opcode, which permits error handling without consuming all gas, support for big integer modular exponentiation, support for variable length return values, and changes to the difficulty adjustment formula to take uncles into account. However, perhaps the most discussed upgrades include the successful addition of fully anonymous zero knowledge proofs (ZK-Snarks), and the delay of the difficulty bomb (nicknamed ice age) by a full year, as well as a reduction of block creation reward from five to three ether. Some have argued that the anonymity of the ZK Snark upgrade will create newfound adoption on Wall Street. Users who do not upgrade will have clients sync to the pre-fork chain without replay protection. Users are advised to download the latest version of Ethereum client - Ethereum Wallet/Mist, geth client (v 1.7.2), Parity client (v 1.7.6), Harmony client (v 2.1.0). Users who are using mobile or Internet-based wallets should be certain to check if their wallet provider is requiring any actions from users. Generally, mobile and Internet providers are running their own client infrastructure, and users should not have to take any action. However, as always it is recommended that users contact their individual providers to be certain.	1
Wonders shall never end in Cryptoland! On Sunday Cointelegraph predicted that it is going to be hot at the top 10 on CoinMarketCap this week. Truly less than 24 hours, on the early mornings on Monday, Ethereum Classic flew so much to make an upward adjustment of 31.46 percent. In the process, ETC knocked down Dash to take over as the sixth most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Nothing surprises anyone anymore in this ecosystem when it comes to the growth of altcoin. Just when everyone thought the battle between Dash and Ethereum Classic is over and that Dash has conquered, the latter has called it a bluff. This brings ETC's market capitalization to almost $900 mln and a market price of $9.72. The gap between it and the pacesetter of decentralized community governance is over $170 mln and even two steps behind. A couple of weeks ago Cointelegraph spoke to Carlo Vicari of Ethereum Classic about its current impressive growth and he was really optimist of the future. He revealed how the Ethereum Classic community is bulging with newcomers. Looks like ETC is gunning for the top to get off his senior brother, Ethereum out of the way, even though it looks unfeasible at the interim. But then again, altcoin growth is like we are in wonderland. Moreso in a classic move Ethereum has regained the number two position from Ripple deepening the gap between them to more than $3 bln. It was with such great improvement of over 36 percentage point of growth. Its market price is now an admirable $174.81. As Cointelegraph predicted, the battle between the two is not yet over, and this was informed by how the two are all well-patronised utility. Whether Ripple can make another come back to the number two spot is just another interesting trend to be on the look out for in this space.  Yet still, the most intriguing development is Bytecoin that was firmly rooted on the tenth rank rising all of a sudden to the seventh position overnight. It made a casualty of Dash and Stellar Lumens and is now behind Ethereum Classic. On Sunday Cointelegraph asked whether Bytecoin has come to the elite echelons to stay or just one of those flash in a pan you see with altcoin. It appears they are proving it is not a fluke at all. The adjustment is unbelievably impressive! A 61.76 percent gain to knock out two strong cryptos tells you they mean business. Anyway, it doesn't look well for Monero at this stage. It's now sitting at number 10 with Dogecoin barking to push it away. For a few months now Cointelegraph has been referring to it as ���gradually declining' Monero.	1
Cambridge University has put out a comprehensive 114-page study on cryptocurrencies that digs deep into empirical data of the digital currency world as it appears across the globe. Key highlights of the study include the number of users and wallets, the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry sectors and the impact the technology is having, as well as interesting information about exchanges, payments and mining. As a nascent industry, information was needed to determine how much of an impact digital currencies are producing. New companies and services have emerged to facilitate the workings of cryptocurrencies, and their data shows that it really is a virgin market. The study found that 1,876 people work full-time in the cryptocurrency industry. Of those, the most find work in Asia-Pacific with 720. Behind that is North America with 676 employees. Information on exchanges offers insight into users of digital currencies, as most people who are involved in crypto have some sort of online wallet. However, the study stated it is nearly impossible to put a figure on how many people actually use cryptocurrency. The study showed that Europe had the highest number of exchanges, followed by Asia-Pacific. As of March 2017, Bitfinex had the highest market share of all exchanges, coming in with 16 percent. However, 25 percent of the overall market share came from a combination of smaller exchanges. Overall, the US Dollar was the most widely supported national currency, appearing on 65 percent of exchanges. Euro came in second with 49 percent prevalence. On the exchanges examined, every single one of them traded in Bitcoin with Ethereum and Litecoin was the next most popular. Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Monero, Dogecoin and Dash were also widespread.  What is interesting to note is that these exchanges that see millions of dollars through them can have as little as 11 employees working on them. 49 percent of exchanges have less than 11 employees. These online exchanges also predominantly operate by holding onto their users��� private keys. In fact, 73 percent of exchanges take custody of users��� cryptocurrency funds by controlling the private keys. According to the study, the number of active wallets is estimated between 5.8 mln and 11.5 mln. The large discrepancy between the range must perhaps have something to do with the difficulty in defining what an active wallet is, as many users are actively storing cryptocurrencies. The highest number of active wallet users comes from North America and Europe with both sitting at just about 30 percent.  Of the active wallets, only 32 percent of them use closed source software while the other 68 are all open source with mobile wallet apps being the most widely offered to users at 65 percent. More than half of surveyed wallet providers offer integrated currency exchange services; additionally, 20 percent offer linked credit card services. However, what is more worrying is that nearly half of wallets providing currency exchange services integrate a third-party exchange, which raises questions about security. Looking at the recent crackdown on digital currencies it is interesting to note that 76 percent of incorporated wallet providers do not have a license. Mining and large mining pools have a big part to play in shaping the digital currency landscape, and because of their importance, many of them are aware of their influence and power. Over half of miners consider their ability to influence protocol development to be high or very high. This comes after recent developments with the SegWit protocol that was implemented on Aug. 1.  Miners and users battled to enact different protocols, and despite half of these big mining pools thinking they have influence, they were probably outdone by the power of the individual users. However, with that, it is the bigger mining pools that still maintain that they have a larger influence on the protocols. It also makes sense to see that 58 percent of the large mining pools are based in China, and that is why it is often believed that China is the key to the Bitcoin mining operations, as well as protocol updates. The US comes in second with 16 percent. Mining revenue, despite the growth of digital currencies, has been up and down. The total Bitcoin mining revenues per year (block reward + transaction fees) if immediately converted to USD was far higher in 2014, than it was in 2016. In 2014, the total came in at $786 mln dollars while 2016 only saw $563, probably due to the increase in difficulty of mining, especially with Bitcoin. However, what did shoot up was Bitcoin transaction fees, as they topped out at $13.6 mln for the year in 2016 while the previous three years combined barely made $7 mln.	1
As a group of 15 consortium members from seven European countries initiates a project to curtail criminals and attackers from using Blockchain technology, the head of Aidos coin (ADK) believes the law enforcement initiative would only target dark market operators. However, in targeting illegal market operators, the initiative would not be able to stop cryptocurrencies being used across the market. Some of the consortium members are AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Coblue Cybersecurity (Netherlands), Countercraft S.L. (Spain), Universit��t Innsbruck (Austria), INTERPOL (International Criminal Police Organization), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), the National Bureau of Investigation (Finland), University College London (UK) and VICOMTECH-IK4 (Spain). ���Since coins are not registered or regulated, they are decentralized. Law enforcement can never shut them down,��� says Ricardo Badoer, an entrepreneur in the finance and construction sectors. He believes the crypto world has been turning into a Ponzi scheme - especially in the last two years - where coin developers release half finished coins just to make fast money. The European researchers behind the three-year ���5 mln project seek to develop technical solutions for investigating and mitigating crime and terrorism involving virtual currencies and transactions in the dark web - the part of the Internet that is beyond the reach of Google and other search engines. While there are many digital currencies in existence, they identify Bitcoin as the best-known application of Blockchain technology. They plan to come up with a way to stop the use of the technology to avoid law detection by evading traditional investigative measures while respecting the privacy rights of those using it for legitimate purposes. Though linking digital currencies to the dark web isn���t new, the consortium���s move comes in the wake of the Bitcoin ransom made by WannaCry attackers, after freezing computers across 150 countries. Badoer thinks these currencies, including ADK, will continue to be used across the market, particularly as the creators lack control over their use. He says: ���We can not control our tech from being used on dark web/dark markets. We are sure our tech will be used. For example, ETH, Monero, Bitcoin and Dash are used in dark markets.��� He adds that he came up with the Tangle-based ADK because the crypto world lost a chance of bringing in more people and investors with the DAO and the ETH vs. ETC issue.	1
Cardano has rewarded its investors with significant gains this year, with a growing number of holders joining the coveted millionaires��� club following the latest ADA price surge. Since the start of the year, the number of millionaire investors in ADA has increased more than 13-fold to 6,710 as of May 17, according to United Kingdom-based news agency Finbold. Using data from Coin Metrics, the agency determined that there were just 504 ADA addresses worth at least $1 million on Jan. 1.  The number of active ADA addresses also grew by 417.81% between Jan. 1 and Apr. 28.  ADA���s value has skyrocketed nearly 1,040% since the start of the year, up from $0.18 to $2.08 at the time of publication. The cryptocurrency peaked closer to $2.40 earlier in the week, setting multiple record highs in the process.  As Cointelegraph recently reported, ADA has entered a new price discovery phase, which means further upside could be in store over the short term. The cryptocurrency now has a market capitalization of $66.1 billion, placing it in the fourth position among active projects. ADA has overtaken Dogecoin (DOGE), Tether (USDT) and XRP amid the latest rally.  Perhaps equally as important is the fact that ADA appears to be bucking the current crypto market downtrend. Over the past seven days, ADA has appreciated by 19%. By comparison, Bitcoin (BTC) has declined 22.6%, and Ether (ETH) is down 15.2%.  In addition to having one of the most dedicated cryptocurrency communities in the industry, Cardano is also benefiting from positive news from Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK. The smart contract platform���s development arm recently explained that its forthcoming Alonzo upgrade is being gradually deployed to the mainnet in May and June.  IOHK also recently partnered with the Ethiopian government to revamp the African nation���s education system. Under the partnership, IOHK will deploy its blockchain solutions across the country, with up to 5 million students potentially benefiting from the program.	1
A recent analysis regarding supply and demand suggests that the end of the Bitcoin bull run will come not as a result of lack of buyers but because of an overabundance of supply. The supply, according to the analyst, will come through new and varied ways to trade Bitcoin and from Bitcoin hard forks. The analysis stems from the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, when any company with .com in its name instantly received a huge market boost. However, the end of the dot-com bubble occurred when a huge number of new .com IPOs flooded the marketplace, many of which were unstable business models. For a while the market absorbed them, but when the market finally corrected it pulled the rug out from all of those businesses and only the strong survived. One of the most important (and most repeated) features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Ask anyone even remotely familiar with the cryptocurrency and they���ll tell you that only 21 mln Bitcoin will ever exist. With such limited supply, how could an oversupply ever  occur? The answer is multifaceted. For starters, Bitcoin hard forks are now creating new derivatives from the original Bitcoin. For example, the Bitcoin Cash hard fork has now created an entirely new Bitcoin with a market cap of $26 bln. Whatever your politics on the BCH fork, the reality is that supply increased. The Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond forks did the same. Further, the issuance of Bitcoin futures may well be the cryptocurrency���s own undoing. Though hyped as an amazing mainstream adoption (true enough indeed), the reality that derivatives of Bitcoin will now be tradable may limit the depth of investment in the original and thin out the pool of investors. According to the analysis: ������as the river of ways to invest in cryptocurrencies widens, the flood that has lifted the price of the Bitcoin will surely recede, and, as always, much faster than people expect."	0
Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, announced that it is officially developing a public Blockchain to create a new decentralized exchange, according a statement on March 13. Binance���s vision that ���centralized and decentralized exchanges will co-exist in the near future, complementing each other��� inspired them to develop the Binance Chain, which  will be used for the transfer and trading of Blockchain assets. The move will also push the cryptocurrency exchange toward transforming from a company into a community. ���We believe that continuously supporting high-quality blockchain projects is the best way to develop this industry. We will continue to improve this part, as we committed in our whitepaper,��� the cryptocurrency exchange said. The new Blockchain will also host Binance Coin (BNB), which will become a native coin on its own Blockchain mainnet. A decentralized exchange differs from a centralized exchange in that it does not rely on  a third party service to hold the customer���s funds. Users transact with other users without the need for a central server, and there is no central authority that possesses order books or custody. While decentralized exchanges provide more anonymity and are lauded as being more difficult to hack, they can be less intuitive for beginning traders and lack some of the features and functionality of centralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges are not new as platforms like Waves DEX, BitShares, NXT, CounterParty have been around for some time. Binance���s statement regarding decentralization was released a day after announcing a $250,000 equivalent bounty to anyone who could provide information that leads to the legal arrest of the hackers responsible for the hacking attempt on March 7.	2
Crypto markets have continued their slump, with Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipping below $10,000 today, Feb. 22, and altcoin Ethereum (ETH) edging closer to $800, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Total market cap is down as well, around $430 bln by press time, down from last week when it broke $500 bln. Bitcoin is currently trading a little over $10,000, down almost 7 percent over a 24-hour period by press time. Cointelegraph reported Wednesday that Bitcoin���s tolerance had seen a monthly high of 34.9 percent, a high barely broken today with CoinMarketCap data showing a 39.5 percent BTC dominance.  Ethereum is down 4 percent over a 24-hour period, trading around $810 by press time.  Altcoin Ripple (XRP) has seen a large dip this week as well. After Saturday, Feb. 21���s, high of $1.21, Ripple is currently trading at around $0.93, down almost 10 percent over a 24-hour period by press time.  After the Feb. 20 launch of Venezuela���s oil-backed government cryptocurrency, the Petro, Twitter user dark pill pointed out that the unrelated and ���abandoned��� cryptocurrency PetroDollar (XPD) briefly saw a price rise on CoinMarketCap potentially due to a similarity in name. Unbelievable: website expired, no commits for 4 years, dev was Bryce Weiner, this abandoned dead shitcoin is pumping just because it has a similar name to the Venezuelan Petro. pic.twitter.com/dgc0lnU7Uw XPD is now down by a little more than 34 percent over a 24-hour period by press time, trading for around $0.03.	0
The crypto markets are against dropping, with Bitcoin (BTC) crashing below $33,000 for the first time since May 23 as Ether (ETH) similarly broke below support at $2,500. The downward momentum comes as bearish indicators continue to stack up for Bitcoin, with popular analyst William Clemente III identifying that miners sold more than 5,000 BTC over the past week ��� worth roughly $164 million at current prices. Miners have sold over 5,000 BTC in the last week pic.twitter.com/5pEvLgIls2 Crypto author Timothy Peterson also highlighted that BTC���s price has remained below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) for 17 days consecutively. ���This metric has *always* marked the end of a bull run and the start of a bear market,��� he asserted. #Bitcoin price has dropped below 200-SMA for 17 consecutive days and counting. This metic has *always* marked the end of a bull run and the start of a bear market. pic.twitter.com/6dpiFbUI7A Although the markets appear to be posting a small intra-day bounce ��� with BTC currently hovering near $33,000 after dropping to $32,400 and ETH currently changing hands for $2,500 after bouncing off a local low of roughly $2,430 ��� both markets have crashed approximately 15% since posting respective local highs of $39,600 and $2,900, respectively, on Thursday. However, while both Ether and Bitcoin have been shedding value over recent weeks, capital flows for crypto investment products suggest that institutional investors are pivoting toward Ether. According to a Monday report from CoinShares, Bitcoin investment products saw record outflows of $141 billion this past week, while Ether products reported inflows of $22 million.	0
Cloud mining service Coinmint has won approval to take over an abandoned smelter for Bitcoin mining operations on Tuesday, Jan. 30. As local news broadcaster WWNYTV reports Thursday along with local government documentation, lawmakers in upstate New York voted in favor of awarding subsidiary North Country Data Center (NCDC) 15 megawatts of low-cost power. This is subject to agreement of tariffs among members, stated the New York Power Authority Board of Trustees and New York State Canal Corporation Board of Directors. The operation should involve a $165 mln investment in infrastructure from Coinmint and the creation of 150 jobs for the population of nearest town Massena and the surrounding area. New York State was previously not known for its involvement or openness to cryptocurrency mining, that title traditionally belonging to Washington State with its cheap electricity. ���That's been one of our main marketing points is that we have cheap reliable power,��� Massena town supervisor Steven O'Shaughnessy countered to WWNYTV. ���It would be good for Massena. I think they are highly technical jobs. We're definitely going to look forward to something like that.��� The encouraging news comes after reports across the Atlantic in Europe that major energy provider Enel had refused renewable energy sales to the cryptocurrency mining operator Envion, claiming it was an ���unsustainable practice.��� The mixed arena continues worldwide, with Russia confirming plans to transform spare grid capacity into mining setups and former monopoly China producing messages about its plans to ostensibly withdraw from the industry altogether. ���This is a large allocation of power, but certainly 150 jobs is nothing to sneeze at,��� Assemblywoman Addie Jenne meanwhile said about the New York���s plans hinting at local government priorities.	2
The International Monetary Fund has said El Salvador���s recent decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in the country may raise legal and financial concerns. In a Thursday press briefing from the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, spokesperson Gerry Rice said the group was already in discussions with lawmakers in El Salvador over a loan to support the country���s economy, having approved emergency funds related to the pandemic last year. However, Rice said an IMF team would be meeting with president Nayib Bukele today and implied crypto would be a likely topic for discussion. ���Adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis,��� said Rice. ���We are following developments closely, and we���ll continue our consultations with the authorities.��� Spokespeople for the IMF have often voiced concerns about countries adopting digital currency. In March, the group issued a similar warning against the Marshall Islands��� recognizing its digital sovereign currency, called SOV, as legal tender, as it may pose similar legal and financial risks. In that case, a spokesman said the islands��� local economy had been strained by the economic fallout of the pandemic and likely wouldn���t be corrected with the SOV. In the case of El Salvador, the time between the introduction of ideas and action is seemingly short. President Bukele first announced he would propose a bill that would make Bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in El Salvador at a pre-recorded video message at the Bitcoin 2021 conference this weekend. The legislation passed with a supermajority in the nation���s Legislative Assembly on Wednesday.  Though the country is still seeking support from the IMF related to the pandemic this year, it has already begun to consider the energy needs of Bitcoin miners. Bukele said he would be instructing state-owned electrical company LaGeo to make certain facilities available to miners to utilize geothermal power from the country���s volcanoes ��� El Salvador currently operates the two geothermal plants in Ahuachap��n and Berl��n. ���Crypto assets can pose significant risks,��� said Rice. ���Effective regulatory measures are very important when dealing with them.���	0
Bitcoin remains a strong buy despite recent losses, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart told CNBC yesterday, May 26. The cryptocurrency will trade ���at least��� above $10,000 by the year���s end, he added. Bogart is a partner at major VC firm Blockchain Capital, and was reportedly the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin and blockchain, authoring a highly regarded blockchain industry report. Bitcoin has now seen three weeks in the negative, its ���longest running streak of losses since September 2017,��� as CNBC���s interview intro noted. Despite this, Bogart outlined a bullish forecast for the long term, saying that: ���The long-term thesis is very much intact... The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occuring...Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they're going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk.��� Bogart suggested however that many altcoins are likely ���overvalued��� and ���have significant headwind,��� emphasizing the dangers of relative valuation. He drew a parallel between the ICO boom in late 2017 - early 2018 and the dot-com boom of the early 2000s, warning that many crypto tokens are ���over-promising and under-delivering.��� Bogart said he would sell alts such as Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO, but was ���neutral��� and would hold Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and EOS. ���I���m very constructive as regards Ethereum on a long-term basis,��� he said. Nonetheless, he considered that Ethereum currently has ���a lot of overhang��� because of the many ���overvalued��� tokens that are built on its platform, and suggested that Ethereum���s future will be closely correlated to the future development of the ICO space. Bogart also noted that this has been the first sustained bear market where nobody has suggested the ���end of Bitcoin.��� He suggested that the reality of a deeper institutionalization of the crypto space is securing the long term ���story,��� and is ���overall positive��� for Bitcoin���s future.   He also said that ongoing turbulence in the traditional financial sector, such as recent national fiat currency crises, is reinforcing Bitcoin���s use cases. "Could Bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely��� I would bet Bitcoin ends at least above $10,000 in the year.��� Negative performance in the crypto markets for now seems to be continuing, with Bitcoin trading below $7,400 to press time, down a further 2 and half percent over the 24 hour period. This despite increasing provisions to facilitate mainstream investment in the crypto space, notably with a recent trend to provide custodian solutions for institutional holders. The ubiquity of the ���institutional investment will lead to a major market uptick��� narrative moved one prominent crypto commentator to protest this weekend: Two words I really don't want to hear this week:   Institutional Investors	2
Pavel Lerner, the managing director of the cryptocurrency exchange EXMO was abducted by ���unknown persons��� in Kiev, reports Ukraine-based web publication Strana.ua.  According to their sources, Lerner was held while leaving his office in the center of town and driven off in a black Mercedes-Benz. Currently, multiple investigations are underway to determine why and by whom Lerner was kidnapped. According to Strana.ua, Lerner is a Russian citizen who holds a residence permit in Poland and is involved in a number of crypto/ Blockchain startups in Ukraine. Lerner���s Facebook page says he is originally from Kursk, Russia. EXMO���s site states that the company is based in Polegate, England. EXMO representatives told local crypto journal ForkLog that the incident has not affected the company���s functioning and that users��� data and funds have in no way been compromised: ���We are doing everything possible to speed up the search of Pavel Lerner. Any information regarding his whereabouts is very much appreciated. Despite the situation, the exchange is working as usual. We also want to stress that nature of Pavel���s job at EXMO doesn���t assume access either to storages or any personal data of users. All users funds are absolutely safe.��� In other news from Ukraine, earlier this month in Odessa, ForkLog reported that both their office and their CEO���s apartment were raided by members of the Ukrainian Security Service. The raid culminated in the seizure of equipment, including those on which personal and corporate cryptocurrency funds were held.	0
On Feb. 16, six large-scale Blockchain projects OmiseGo, Cosmos, Golem, Maker and Raiden, that have completed successful multi-million dollar initial coin offerings (ICOs) last year, along with Japanese venture capital firm Global Brain have created the Ethereum Community Fund (ECF), to fund projects and businesses within the Ethereum ecosystem. The ECF will begin with $100 mln, likely raised by the six Blockchain projects. Some members of the Ethereum Foundation including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin plan to advise the fund. Buterin told TechCrunch: ���Ethereum has grown beyond my expectations over the last few years, but the work is clearly not finished. Delivering value that matches the hype should be the mantra of 2018; efforts such as the ECF which help organize the development of the ecosystem are going to help to make that possible.��� In September 2017, Buterin revealed that his advisor shares from $1.8 bln project OmiseGo and $370 mln decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Kyber Network will be allocated in a private fund to finance open-source projects building innovative technologies such as scaling solutions for the Ethereum Blockchain network. Buterin emphasized that he will no longer advise any other Blockchain project apart from OmiseGo and Kyber Network and that all of the incentives he received from the two Blockchain projects will be used to improve the Ethereum protocol. At the time, Buterin said: ���I'm announcing that 100% of my OmiseGo + Kyber Network advisor shares will be either donated to charity (AMF, GiveD, SENS etc) or used to privately fund Ethereum second-layer infrastructure (state channels, multisig wallets etc) or some combination of the two.��� But, Buterin noted that all projects eligible to receive financing from his private fund must be completely open-source and have no profit schemes in place. ���Must be 100 percent open source, no baked-in profit scheme (including ICO token), must be good,��� noted Buterin, emphasizing that open-source projects, especially those focusing on Ethereum scalability, are struggling to obtain funding. ���Open source infrastructure projects currently are struggling to get funding without the ICO+token route; hopefully this can help.��� Given Buterin���s support towards open-source projects, the same rule of only funding open-source projects used by his private fund will likely be applied to the $100 mln ECF. TechCrunch reported that grants will be in the range of $50,000 to $500,000, and some projects may even receive additional funding to complete long-term development of technologies and solutions. Only open-source projects with no profit schemes will most likely be eligible for the grants. Previously, Augur co-founder and cryptocurrency venture capital firm chief investment officer Joey Krug publicly expressed his concerns regarding the lack of developers and open-source projects working on scaling solutions to enhance the Ethereum network. Krug  said: ���Ethereum really needs more developers on problems like sharding, proof of stake, and plasma, right now there simply aren't enough. It should also hire some more operations people to help orchestrate it all, for instance, Solidity is just now being formally audited.��� Without open-source scaling projects, the Ethereum network will continue to struggle with scaling issues, and the network is currently processing just over a million transactions per day. Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam also noted that the Ethereum network would have to improve by 100-fold in order to support decentralized applications with millions of users. Over the past few months, the entrance of successful decentralized applications such as CryptoKitties, CryptoKribs, Bancor and EtherCraft had led the Ethereum Blockchain network to struggle with scaling issues. Because decentralized applications like CryptoKitties can severely congest the Ethereum network by processing several transactions every time an order is executed, an efficient scaling solution is necessary to address the growing demand.  Image source: Dappradar.com The development of scaling solutions such as Sharding and Plasma that can expand the transaction capacity of the Ethereum network can be sped up through funds and grant systems like ECF, and with that, Ethereum could evolve into a better platform for decentralized applications.	2
Block reward halvings cut the rate at which new coins are generated on a given blockchain by 50%. Such events, known jokingly as ���halvenings,��� have long been anticipated by cryptocurrency traders as catalysts for pushing up the price of their cryptocurrency holdings.  Past attempts to predict when Bitcoin���s (BTC) price would increase in relation to halvings have proved inconsistent at best. However, few would be willing to quickly discount the mechanisms described in the law of supply and demand. All things being equal, as the number of coins available on the market decreases, the demand for those coins ��� and thus, the price of each ��� increases. With that in mind, here are four cryptocurrency projects that are due to undergo block reward halvings in the coming year, when their issuance rate will be cut in half. Verge (XVG) is set to undergo a halving on Jan. 25 when its chain reaches a block height of 4,700,000. At this point, the current reward of 200 XVG which is issued to miners every 30 seconds will be cut to 100 XVG. With just over 11 days to go before the halving, it may be assumed that the opportunity to get ahead of the reduction in Verge���s supply has already passed. However, capitalizing on block reward halvings has never been an exact science, and often times a coin fails to react to the event until after the fact. The XVG price hit an all-time high of $0.30 back in December 2017, before suffering a near three-year slide down to the $0.001 mark by 2020. Since the winter surge that sent Bitcoin to a new all-time high, however, Verge���s fortunes have reversed. The coin recorded growth of 219% between November and the time of writing.  Tomochain���s (TOMO) halving will occur on Feb. 7, when the number of TOMO coins issued yearly will be reduced from 2 million to 1 million.  The Tomochain blockchain features block times of two seconds, and every 900 blocks make up an epoch. For each epoch, a total of 250 coins are issued to miners at the current time. This figure will be halved to 125 coins in February. Launched in 2017, Tomochain uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The upcoming halving will be only the second in the coin���s history, and also its last. From here on, the TOMO issuance rate will remain the same until the coin���s total supply of 100,000,000 has been reached.  Vertcoin���s (VTC) block reward halving is scheduled for Dec. 8, at which point the number of VTC issued to miners will be reduced from 25 to 12.5 per block.  Vertcoin was forked from Litecoin (LTC)  ��� itself a Bitcoin fork ��� in 2014 as a response to the application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC, machines that were invented for Litecoin mining the same year. Vertcoin aims to remain ASIC-resistant and can be mined with a GPU. Once a feature of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, Vertcoin now finds itself ranked in the mid-500s after a 98% decline from its all-time high in December 2017. Although not technically scheduled to take place until January 2022, Ravencoin���s (RVN) first block reward halving is just 12 calendar months away and will see the issuance rate cut from 5,000 RVN to 2,500 RVN per block.  Launched in 2018, Ravencoin is geared toward the registration and trade of real-world assets on the blockchain. In 2018, the then little-known project received a surprise investment of ���millions of dollars��� from online American retail giant Overstock. Ravencoin reached an all-time high in the $0.08 range in June 2019. Today, the coin trades at a price of $0.016 ��� a 48% increase since recent lows in November 2020.	1
The cryptocurrency markets are showing slight positive growth today March 10, with Bitcoin (BTC) rising back up above $9,000 and almost all of the top 100 coins, except one, listed on CoinMarketCap in the green as of press time. BTC had reached over $11,500 during its intra-week high on March 5, before dropping below $9000 yesterday, March 9. BTC is currently trading at around $9,500, up around 5 percent over a 24 hour period to press time.  Ethereum (ETH) is still below $800, but up from its monthly low under $700 yesterday, March 9. The top altcoin is trading now around $740, up around 5.5 percent over a 24-hour period by press time. Ethereum has consistently stayed below $1000 ��� a price point it had previously broken in mid-January ��� ever since the market dip in early February.  Of the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up the most over a 24 hour period, around 9 percent, and trading around $1,084 by press time. Altcoin Ripple (XRP) is up the least of the top ten coin on CoinMarketCap, a little more than 1 percent over a 24 hour period, trading around $0.84 by press time. Total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies is around $389 bln by press time, on the lower end compared to its February highs over $500 bln, but up from it���s monthly low of $344 bln March 9.  Image source: coin360.io Although the markets are seeing a slight recovery today, the overall slump since the beginning of the year has been attributed to the $400 mln sell-off by the bankruptcy trustee of the former crypto exchange Mt. Gox. The more recently slump this week can be credited to global regulatory news, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announcement that all crypto trading platforms should register with the SEC.	2
Spartan Black, a major cryptocurrency fund based in Asia, believes Polkadot (DOT) has more fuel left in the tank and could soar into the top-3 list of biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Currently, the popular protocol is listed as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at CoinGecko. Since listing on Binance eight days ago, the price of DOT soared by more than 200% and many analysts believe the price could rise significantly higher.   DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView.com There are several favorable factors buoying the sentiment around DOT. The protocol does not directly compete against the Ethereum Network, it scales rapidly, and as a result, could offset the issue of high fees on Ethereum. DOT has seen meteoric growth in recent weeks in terms of both valuation and projects. Data from PolkaProject shows there are 197 projects in the Polkadot ecosystem already. Apart from having strong technologies, Polkadot also has arguably one of the most decorated developers within the smart contracts space.  Gavin Wood created Polkadot in 2016 and is a key figure behind the development of Ethereum���s solidity programming language and Parity Technologies. Wood also played a key role in the growth of the Ethereum Network over the past four years. The combination of an active community, a growing number of projects in the ecosystem and Wood���s involvement appear to be driving the demand for DOT. Spartan Black���s Kelvin Koh predicted in mid-August that DOT would hit $5 based on the market capitalization of Cardano. Within weeks of the prediction, DOT surpassed $5, rising to as high as $6.57. At the time, Koh said: ���If ADA���s market cap is $3.8B, then Polkadot should be worth at least $5B i.e. $5 per DOT.��� As a follow up prediction, Koh said that he expects DOT to become a top three cryptocurrency on Coingecko and CoinMarketCap. He stated: ���Another prediction: within a year DOT will be Top 3 market cap on Coingecko/CMC.��� Ethereum has been by far the most dominant smart contracts blockchain protocol to date. It has a valuation of $43 billion, followed by DOT at $5.6 billion. Polkadot does not directly compete against Ethereum, and as Koh explained, the long-term prosperity of DOT should not result in a decline of Ethereum. Blockchains, like Polkadot and Cosmos, which enable multiple blockchain networks to exist on their protocols, are structurally different from Ethereum. Koh explained: ���I believe in a multi-chain world interconnected by bridges. Polkadot and Cosmos will not replace Ethereum. Also wouldn���t rule out chains like Near, Solana, AVA, TRON and others seeing development activity.��� If Polkadot, along with other smart contracts protocols, can co-exist with Ethereum, it raises the chances for long-term survivability. Major exchanges have already listed DOT after its major denomination change, showing support for the cryptocurrency. Even exchanges in the United States, including Kraken, listed DOT quickly after its launch. Blocktown Capital���s Joseph Todaro said: ���Kraken listing Polkadot before Coinbase and Binance US has been a massive win. If you are in the US and want DOT exposure Kraken is where you have to go.���	2
Suspicion is growing around Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail after its owner seemingly asked for a coin���s ledger to be changed after the exchange reported funds were missing Thursday, Feb 8. BitGrail, a lesser-known exchange in the cryptocurrency space, reportedly suffered losses of one of its hosted tokens, Nano (formerly known as Raiblocks), subsequently freezing trading. In a note on their website posted Feb. 9, the exchange stated that 17 million Nano had been stolen in the hack, an amount worth about $187 million at the time the losses were discovered. XRB withdrawals will be enabled again as soon as possible. Funds are safe, users still have access to them.  Withdrawals that were pending since before this maintenance should have been completed.  Reminder: withdrawals for other coins are available.  Thank you for understanding. Feb. 9, a day after they were informed of the hack, Nano developers provided an official comment showing that BitGrail���s owner and operator Francesco ���The Bomber��� Firano had asked for the altcoin���s ledger to be altered. ���...Firano informed us of missing funds from BitGrail���s wallet. An option suggested by Firano was to modify the ledger in order to cover his losses ��� which is not possible, nor is it a direction we would ever pursue,��� Nano wrote in a Medium post. Nano promptly dropped almost 20% across exchanges in the past two days, while updates from BitGrail on social media have yet to appear, except for a tweet Feb. 8 saying Nano (XRB) markets were ���currently unavailable���. XRB Markets currently unavailable. However, a Twitter user named Francesco the Bomber, allegedly Firano, posted a string of tweets about the hack, the most recent of which referenced ���unfounded accusations...by the dev team���, likely a response to Nano���s post on Medium. The reputation of both Firano and BitGrail currently appears shaky, Nano continuing it considered his behavior ���misleading.��� ���We now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time,��� the  Nano post continues. The BitGrail debacle comes as dust continues to settle on Japanese exchange Coincheck���s giant $530mln hack late last month. Although accusations of foul play have been few, questions remain about security practices as state regulators conduct an ongoing major investigation. On Twitter, cryptocurrency industry commentators reacted cautiously, one likening Firano���s request to what happened in the DAO hack in June, 2016, after which Ethereum was hard-forked to refund users. Nano noted that even if Firano���s request were accepted, changing transaction history was ���not possible���.	0
Though the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) surged over the weekend to surpass $0.06 again, this time another token based on a cuddly canine benefited from the hype around Elon Musk���s social media posts. In a Saturday tweet, the Tesla CEO said he would be getting a Shiba Inu dog for his household. The dog ��� whose breed is native to Japan ��� was at the center of the popular meme from which Dogecoin took its name in 2013. The doge meme features a Shiba Inu looking into the camera with a seemingly confused expression as floating text represents its inner monologue. Though Musk���s tweets have likely contributed to the price of DOGE reaching an all-time high of more than $0.08 earlier this year, the token price didn���t flinch at the billionaire���s acquisition of a new family pet. The Tesla CEO may have been joking or referring to Shiba Inu (SHIB), a different cryptocurrency project. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of SHIB rose 300% in the hours following Musk���s tweet: Musk���s social media activity may be partially responsible for moving the price of DOGE in 2021. Though the Tesla CEO also composed a series of Dogecoin-themed tweets on Saturday, the token price didn���t take off as it did in early February, having risen only 4.6% in the last 24 hours. However, the price of SHIB set a new all-time high of $0.00000008 before retreating to $0.00000005. Musk has previously said he has ���a big dog called Gatsby, a little dog called Marvin the Martian and a cat named Schr��dinger.��� It���s unclear whether the billionaire actually intends to add a Shiba Inu to his family, or if the tweet was another attempt to pump the price of certain tokens.	2
Update (04:00 EST): This article was updated and corrected to explain how the official exchange rate distorts reported Bitcoin prices in Iran.   Iran-based sellers on peer-to-peer trading platform LocalBitcoins are currently asking for around 1 billion Iranian rials or over $24,000 per Bitcoin (BTC), based on the official exchange rate from the country���s central bank.  But is this really the actual price Iranians are paying for Bitcoin?  LocalBitcoins lowest offers per BTC. Source: LocalBitcoins However, the apparent staggering premium in Iran relative to the current global market price may only exist on the surface.  In reality, it is not uncommon for countries with weak national currencies ��� such as Venezuela ��� to have dual exchange rates: one ���official��� rate set by the country���s central bank and the other, the actual market rate, or the real amount of dollars a regular person would get for their rials.  ���It���s only possible for few businesses and government with special procedure to get that rate,��� explained a crypto expert Ali Beikverdi. ���The official rate is what the central bank says. But literally, no one except some government organizations can get that rate while no one can use it. It���s a joke.��� ���So if you wanna buy USD today in Tehran, the price is about 140,000 IRR,��� he says. In other words, while the ���official rate��� is around 42,000 IRR per 1 USD ��� which would result in the $24,000 price per Bitcoin ��� the actual rate in the street would give one something closer to BTC���s actual global market price, currently around $7,300 USD.  As Cointelegraph reported, an airstrike at Baghdad's airport ordered by United States President Donald Trump killed the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani. This has led to a surge in global oil prices as well as Bitcoin rebounding from weekly lows of around $6,850.  Meanwhile, looking at the BTC rates on LocalBitcoin in Iran, founder of crypto analytics outlet Messari Ryan Selkis mistakingly noted that there is now a huge premium as a result. He wrote:  ���Bitcoin is trading at nearly $24,000 in the USD equivalent of Iranian Rials on LocalBitcoins today. It's unlikely those purchases are paying for the Iranian military's response. Instead, it might be innocent (and desperate) Iranians looking for a way out of the coming chaos.��� But given the dual exchange rate reality in Iran, it is likely that no one is actually paying this much per Bitcoin. ���There is a slight increase in dollar price today from what I see in the local market but that���s about it,��� adds Beikverdi. At the same time, reported trading volumes on LocalBitcoins have hit rock bottom in recent months. This is likely due to Iran���s government restricting internet access across the country since November amid nationwide protests in response to rising fuel prices.    LocalBitcoins weekly trading volume, Iran. Source: Coin.dance Meanwhile, Iran vowed to seek revenge on the U.S. on Friday following the killing of Soleimani, NBC News reported. Last month, Cointelegraph reported that Iran was proposing a Muslim cryptocurrency as one of a number of means to confront the economic dominance of the United States. ���The Muslim world should be designing measures to save themselves from the domination of the United States dollar and the American financial regime,��� said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Nevertheless, Iran holds an unfavorable position on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general as authorities have offered a bounty to anyone who exposes unauthorized mining operations in the country.	0
It has become likely that Bitcoin Cash will be created by a group of miners led by ViaBTC on August 1. However, investors should not fear the creation of Bitcoin Cash.  Last week, some of the largest and leading Bitcoin exchanges and businesses including Coinbase and BitMEX clarified that they are not in favor of Bitcoin Cash and thus, cannot support the hard fork led by ViaBTC. Coinbase emphasized that it is not willing to support Bitcoin Cash due to its contentious nature, while BitMEX noted that Bitcoin Cash will likely lead to serious security issues. ���BitMEX will not support the split or distribution of Bitcoin Cash, nor will BitMEX be liable for any Bitcoin Cash sent to BitMEX. Therefore, it is up to our users to withdraw from BitMEX prior to August 1st if they wish to access Bitcoin Cash tokens or any other hardfork,��� said BitMEX. Bitmain, arguably the most influential mining equipment manufacturer in the industry and the operator of the largest Bitcoin mining pool Antpool, initially introduced the possibility of hard forking the Bitcoin Blockchain in order to create Bitcoin Cash. But, in its later announcement, Bitmain emphasized that the user-activated hard fork (UAHF) was merely a contingency plan for user-activated soft fork (UASF). Further adding that it did not intend to pursue the execution of a hard fork if the mining community, industry, and users came together and agreed on one activation mechanism to activate the Bitcoin Core development team���s transaction malleability fix and scaling solution Segregated Witness (SegWit). In the end, the mining community locked in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal BIP 91, which led to the lock-in of BIP 141 and finalization of SegWit activation. As analysts including Squeeze noted, Bitcoin price has held up well and maintained its upward momentum throughout the week, despite the high probability of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. For the most part, that is because the vast majority of the industry, its largest businesses, traders, investors and users will be considering Bitcoin Cash as merely an alternative cryptocurrency or altcoin, instead of Bitcoin. In an open source development ecosystem, developers can free to fork off a project and create their own. Ethereum Classic drifted away from Ethereum, and it has become the sixth largest cryptocurrency in the market. Monero forked off Bytecoin and experienced a major success, becoming the ninth largest cryptocurrency while Bytecoin faded. Investors or traders of Bitcoin will be credited with Bitcoin Cash due to its development team���s decision to implement replay protection. Some businesses including Bitrefill and Bixin plan to sell Bitcoin Cash and credit users with additional Bitcoin, which Bitcoin Core developers including Peter Todd described as a viable option.	1
July 17: Crypto markets are largely continuing to build on a major upswing that kicked off yesterday, July 16, according to Coin360 data, with virtually all of the top ten coins by market cap in the green.  Market visualization from Coin360 Ongoing positive momentum now looks set to reverse the major valuation losses incurred last week, which could now prove to have been a temporary dip rather than a lasting downtrend. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $7,209, up a little over 8 percent over the 24-hour period to press time. The leading cryptocurrency has today pushed further beyond yesterday���s peak trading price of $6,679, with the day���s upwards spike continuing at press time. Bitcoin has now brought its weekly and monthly gains into net positive territory, which are at around 6 and 2 percent respectively. The coin has now outstripped its outstanding rally on July 8 when the coin hit almost $6,800.  Bitcoin 7-day price chart.

Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is now at around $286 billion to press time.  Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap Consolidation of yesterday���s significant market growth is likely still buoyed by yesterday���s bullish news that the $6.3 trillion asset management heavyweight BlackRock ������ the world���s largest provider of exchange traded-funds (ETF) ������ is beginning to assess potential involvement in Bitcoin. CNBC trading advisor Ran Neu-Ner has today drawn attention to the news that the world-renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) examination is adding cryptocurrency and blockchain topics to its curriculum, a move that is poised to bring widespread knowledge of crypto to the financial mainstream. Neu-Ner���s excitement comes following his remark yesterday that BlackRock���s potential entry into crypto would make 2017���s bull run come to ���look like a warm-up��� -- echoing the widespread narrative that major institutional interest is set to skyrocket crypto valuations. Positive news has continued to flood in today, with Japanese internet giant SBI Holdings formally launching the public version of its crypto exchange VCTRADE today, a triumph in the context of increasingly stringent regulatory demands for tightened security among the country���s operators. Major U.S. crypto exchange and wallet service provider Coinbase has meanwhile just received the all-clear from the country���s regulators to list specific digital assets that are considered to be securities ��� representing significant progress in its bid to operate as an officially regulated crypto broker dealer. Also today, a new project for a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that runs on the Stellar blockchain network received backing from tech giant IBM, which has reportedly already begun testing the asset. Aviation giant Boeing has for its part announced that it will be partnering with an artificial intelligence (AI) firm to develop pilotless vehicles and other products using blockchain.	2
Japan���s tax reform bill which officially eliminated consumption tax on the sale of Bitcoin came into effect on July 1. Bitcoin trading activities are expected to rise in Japan following the activation of the bill. In a report entitled ���Japan: Inbound Tax Alert, 2017 Tax Reform Proposals,��� Deloitte previously revealed that virtual currencies including Bitcoin were set to be exempt from the eight percent consumption tax in Japan. Deloitte���s report read: ���The supply of virtual currency will be exempt from Japanese Consumption Tax (���JCT���). Currently, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin do not fall under the category of exempt sales, and as a result, the sale of virtual currencies in Japan have been treated as taxable for JCT purposes. Following the enactment of the amended Fund Settlement Law in May 2016, which newly defined ���virtual currency��� as a means of settlement, the sale of virtual currency as defined under the new Fund Settlement Law will be exempt from JCT. This change will apply to sales/purchase transactions performed in Japan on or after 1 July 2017.��� On March 27, the Japanese National Diet officially approved the 2017 tax reform proposals shared by Deloitte, passing the Bitcoin consumption tax bill along with other bills listed on the proposed reforms. The bill, which came into effect on July 1, is expected to drastically increase Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading activities within the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange market. On April 1, the Japanese government officially recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method and currency. Since then, the Japanese government has been focusing on creating and establishing a more efficient ecosystem for Bitcoin traders, businesses and users. A major part of the initiative was to render Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading frictionless, allowing traders to easily access cryptocurrencies without having to deal with external factors such as taxes. The Japanese Bitcoin exchange market is already well regulated and well-equipped with appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. AML policies are especially strict in Japan and South Korea, it is difficult for traders to take advantage of potential arbitrage opportunities and utilize Bitcoin to move large sums of money outside of Japan without triggering the AML systems adopted by local trading platforms. Although it could be completely coincidental- since the activation of the Japanese Bitcoin tax elimination bill on July 1, Bitcoin price increased from around $2,450 to $2,570. It is not a fair assessment to wholly attribute Bitcoin���s upward momentum to the Japanese market as it only accounts for 16.2 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market. However, positive signs for Bitcoin trading in Japan could have established a positive precedent across Asia, which controls more than 65 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market share and affected bitcoin price. Bitcoin���s tax elimination bill is also important for the ecosystem of Japanese Bitcoin merchants. Recently, some of Japan���s most influential companies including its largest electronics retailer Bic Camera started to accept Bitcoin as a digital currency and a payment method. Soon, hundreds of thousands of restaurants, cafes and stores could begin accepting Bitcoin as AirRegi, Japan���s largest point of sale machine operator, is looking to integrate Bitcoin by the fall of 2017.	2
According to users on Poloniex���s unofficial subreddit, the exchange has not be crediting user account balances when orders are cancelled. One user wrote: ���When I cancel any open orders, the original USDT value isn't returned. Usually, the intended buy value is returned to my total and everything is fine but just noticed today that every time I cancel an order, the "Estimated value of holdings" (DEPOSITS & WITHDRAWALS tab) gets smaller and smaller and never returns to the original total.��� Poloniex responded via their official Twitter account today, saying: We're investigating reports of canceled orders not crediting back to account balances. Several reddit users have since chimed in, saying that their account balances had been restored to the appropriate level. Other redditors have been complaining of their account balances reflecting inaccurate or even negative amounts: ���My margin account spazzed out a few minutes ago. My positions are in profit, and still showing as such individually, but I am suddenly seeing alerts of "Forced Liquidation" and a Margin of ~16%. Thankfully, none of my positions have actually been liquidated but I am now effectively unable to manage any of them due to the margin being so low. I have experienced similar issues with the margin system before and they've typically righted themselves, but this is extremely inconvenient. Hopefully they're just having a system issue and everything will be restored.��� Poloniex has responded to this issue as well, indicating that they are working to restore correct balances and will be pausing all forced liquidations: Some balances are off and will be corrected. Forced liquidations are turned off temporarily. While virtually all cryptocurrency exchanges have faced significant growing pains, users have been complaining about Poloniex���s customer service issues for nearly a year. Many have complained of extremely long response times to tickets, with one user claiming he���s waited over 158 days for a response to his ticket. Another user writes: ���Been waiting on withdrawal verification for 3 months!! This is crazy!! Do I have to get a lawyer? Can't get access to my own money!��� The author of this article has personally experienced delays in excess of one month when withdrawing funds. Despite having the highest verification level and using 2FA, on three separate occasions this author has had withdrawals sit in ���awaiting approval��� status for weeks, despite numerous support tickets asking for assistance.	1
According to reports in the Wall Street Journal, JP Morgan Chase is considering providing access to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange���s (CME) Bitcoin futures trading through its futures platform.  The CME���s announcement last week regarding the addition of Bitcoin futures sent prices of the cryptocurrency to new all time highs over $8,300. According to the report: "J.P. Morgan is considering whether to provide its clients access to CME's new Bitcoin product through its futures-brokerage unit.��� The irony of the announcement, of course, is that Jamie Dimon has been the most outspoken critic of Bitcoin on Wall Street, calling it a ���fraud��� and saying that anyone who invests in Bitcoin is ���stupid���. Dimon also said he would fire anyone caught investing in it - a promise which he has yet to fulfill. The strongly negative leanings of some Wall Street pundits have been matched by the positive outlooks from others. However, whether Jamie gets in or not, Bitcoin futures will likely become a reality in early December, powerfully increasing adoption.	2
BTCC and BATPOOL support for SegWit2x has taken the overall community consensus beyond the 80 percent threshold needed for adoption. While the figure stood at 71 percent of network hash rate just yesterday, Tuesday has finally seen the number surpass the crucial marker to take effect. SegWit2x, acceptance of which would all but guarantee the implementation of SegWit for Bitcoin, has received as much hype and criticism as any potential solution in the Bitcoin scaling debate. Reacting to the latest developments, however, the cryptocurrency community appeared overwhelmingly relieved. We are going to get SegWit! #Bitcoin Ding, ding, ding! With BTCC and BATPOOL now signaling for SegWit2x, the 80% network hash rate threshold has been hithttps://t.co/Uc5xpYl4n2 https://t.co/zAmYTKuyiZ The code for SegWit2x is still in its alpha stage, with a beta release slated for the end of June. Support has already come from the majority of well-known mining pools including Antpool, Bitfury and F2Pool. Pro-Bitcoin Unlimited pools Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC also joined the support. Meanwhile, in an explanatory post about SegWit2x on Monday, Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song noted the code���s implementation is ���actually a trickier question than it may seem.��� ���This is a positive development if you���re hoping to avoid a permanent split as it looks like Bitcoin will stay on one chain,��� he wrote. ���But the battle is not over. The bigger and more contentious issue of a 2MB hard fork is the one that still needs to be settled.���	2
Robinhood chief operating officer Christine Brown has praised the Shiba Inu community but said safety was the platform���s priority over the ���short-term gain��� of listing new tokens. Brown made the comments in an interview for the Crypto Goes Mainstream event streamed live on YouTube on Tuesday. When asked about Shiba Inu (SHIB) she said: However, Brown would not be drawn on whether the American stock and crypto trading app would list Shiba Inu. SHIB is currently the 11th-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $30 billion. The community has stepped up a campaign to convince Robinhood to list SHIB, and a Change.org petition has now obtained more than half a million signatures.  Brown stated that Robinhood is a ���safety-first company��� that closely assesses the regulatory feasibility of its listings. ���Our strategy is different than a lot of the other players out there who are racing to list as many assets as possible right now,��� she said.  Brown also revealed that Robinhood���s crypto wallet waitlist has surpassed 1.6 million users. When launched, the crypto wallet will finally allow users to move cryptocurrencies on and off the platform. The high demand indicates users are eager to gain control over their coins.  SHIB is priced at $0.00005430 on CoinGecko and has been on a downtrend since Nov. 3 when a wallet holding about $5.7 billion of the token sprang back to life.	2
87-year-old American investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, has again scorned investment in cryptocurrencies, claiming that ���buying Bitcoin is not investing,��� in an interview with Yahoo Finance in Omaha, Nebraska, today, April 28. ���There���s [sic] two kinds of items that people buy and think they���re investing,��� he said. ���One really is investing and the other isn���t.��� He added: ���If you buy something like a farm, an apartment house, or interest in a business [���] [y]ou can do that on a private basis [���] and it���s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don���t really have anything that has produced anything. You���re just hoping the next guy pays more.��� Buffett went on to suggest that such investments are merely a speculative ���game��� and a ���gamble��� and that ���no one knows exactly what it [Bitcoin] is.��� The so-called ���Oracle of Omaha��� has repeatedly poured contempt on the crypto industry, claiming with oxymoronic ���almost certainty" that cryptocurrencies ���will come to a bad end,��� in an interview this January, all the while admitting that cryptocurrencies are ���something I don't know anything about.��� Buffet has been recycling the lack of intrinsic value argument since 2014, when he first dismissed Bitcoin as "a mirage" on CNBC. Buffett has also wielded the bubble argument against Bitcoin, as well as stating that BTC cannot be valued because ���it���s not a value-producing asset.��� The Oracle���s anti-crypto stance is shared by ousted Paypal CEO Bill Harris, who called Bitcoin a ���scam��� this week, and Buffet���s vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway, 94-year-old Charlie Munger, who thinks interest in Bitcoin is ���simply disgusting���.	0
As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade sideways around $48,000, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell is not counting out a potential crash on cryptocurrency markets in the short term. A crypto winter is now ���possible,��� Powell said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg Technology, noting that Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem have historically evolved around cycles based ���sort of around the Bitcoin halving.��� But despite a potentially looming crypto winter, Powell is confident that the market will bounce back from a bear market once investors start buying, should BTC drop below $40,000: In the interview, Powell mentioned some of his previous Bitcoin predictions, including his $100,000 Bitcoin forecast for late 2021. The CEO made this prediction in August, stating, ���I think we could see $100,000 plus a coin late this year early next year.��� He also predicted that Bitcoin price is going to "infinity" in March. ���It���s hard to know where it goes,��� Kraken CEO said in the latest interview, noting that he is still bullish on Bitcoin in the long term. ���When you look at a long-term trendline of Bitcoin and it���s just up consistently. I always tell people, 'If you think about buying Bitcoin, think about it as a five-year plus investment.'" Many prominent figures in the crypto community predicted BTC would hit $100,000 by the end of 2021, including stock-to-flow model creator PlanB, Morgan Creek Digital Assets co-founder Anthony Pompliano, SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci and others. Last week, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan claimed that $100,000 by the end of the year was a ���difficult prediction to make,��� suggesting that the price level could come in 2022.	1
Stripe, the mobile payment processor with a $9 bln valuation, has announced that it is officially winding down its Bitcoin integration. Over the next three months, Stripe customers will be encouraged to migrate away from Bitcoin payments. After that, Bitcoin will no longer be accepted at all. Stripe made waves in 2015 when it fully integrated Bitcoin, allowing all vendors who use the platform to accept Bitcoin payments. Many saw this as a sign of impending mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment method, but high fees and slow transaction confirmations have hobbled the network. In a blog post, Stripe noted the high hopes the company had for Bitcoin when it first integrated the currency into its platform: ���Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive.��� Stripe cites slow confirmation times and high fees as the reason for its abandonment of Bitcoin as a payment method: ���This has led to Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it���s for the ���wrong��� amount.) Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.��� Stripe remains optimistic about cryptocurrency as a whole, but the company sees Bitcoin as more of an asset than a payment network: ���Over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange. Given the overall success that the Bitcoin community has achieved, it���s hard to quibble with the decisions that have been made along the way. (And we���re certainly happy to see any novel, ambitious project do so well.)��� The company���s comments echo those of others in the digital currency space, such as Max Keiser, who see Bitcoin as a sort of ���Gold 2.0��� rather than a medium of exchange: ���[The digital currency] Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.��� While Keiser cites Dash as a more viable payment network than Bitcoin, Stripe cites several other currencies as contenders: ���OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects. We may add support for Stellar (to which we provided seed funding) if substantive use continues to grow. It���s possible that Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, or another Bitcoin variant, will find a way to achieve significant popularity while keeping settlement times and transaction fees very low.��� Notably, the company has no plans to integrate any of those supposedly ���better��� currencies into its platform. Stripe has left itself open to reconsider Bitcoin as a payment method in the future: ���We���re interested in what���s happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments...Bitcoin itself may become viable for payments again in the future.��� With the slow uptake of Segregated Witness and the effective death of plans to increase Bitcoin���s blocksize, all eyes turn to the Lightning Network to make Bitcoin viable again for payments. The Lightning Network has been under development for quite awhile, and there are several competing implementations. None of them are considered to be safe or suitable for general use, however. With Stripe, Steam and others ending their acceptance of Bitcoin payments, it���s clear that if the currency is to be considered a viable network for payments, lightning better strike soon.	0
The popular ���fan token��� reward and engagement blockchain Chiliz notched another win yesterday by signing a pair of popular European racing teams.  In a press release on Friday, Socios.com ��� a fan token app built on Chiliz ��� announced that Aston Martin Cognizant and Alfa Romeo Racing were the latest to launch tokens on the platform. Fan tokens have been used to distribute merchandise, create augmented reality marketing campaigns, and in certain instances allow fans to vote on things like team uniforms ��� a niche asset that has brought in over $150 million in revenues for Socios.  The Formula 1 teams weren���t the only wins for Chiliz this week, as they join NASCAR���s Roush Fenway Racing. The teams are among the first processional motor racing teams to experiment with blockchain technology ��� part of a growing number of sports and organizations using the tech to better connect with fans.  ���Last week, in a single day, we announced five partnerships ��� from three different sports, across three continents ��� and now we���ve continued that momentum convincingly,��� said Chiliz CEO Alex Dreyfus in a press release. ���In the next few years a generation of passive fans will shift into active fans. That transition will take place through transactional fan engagement on our platform.��� While Chiliz has effectively cornered the fan token market, multiple platforms continue to battle over the NFTs, memorabilia, and collectibles space.  While Dapper Labs��� NBA Top Shot currently reigns supreme with nearly half a billion in collectible basketball highlight sales (and has attracted multiple billions in VC investment as of late), though last month prices suffered a ���silent crash��� amid a market-wide NFT pullback.  However, other chains and platforms are fighting to attract sports licensing as well, such as WAX���s collaboration with the iconic TOPPs baseball trading card company ��� part of an ongoing battle between NFT platforms over high-value IP.	1
The biggest pension fund in the world lost $164.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020. This is equivalent to the entire market capitalization for Bitcoin (BTC). Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, or GPIF, decreased in value by almost 11% to 150.63 trillion yen or $1.4 trillion. This was the fund���s steepest quarterly decline since 2008.   Dow Jones & BTC. Source: Yahoo Finance. GPIF was not alone in its poor performance, major stock indexes like Dow Jones posted negative numbers. Interestingly, Bitcoin���s performance was almost identical, where its price from January 1 to March 31 fell by approximately the same 11%. Thus, this is not a case where Bitcoin supporters are able to champion Bitcoin���s perceived safe-haven status. On the other hand, had GPIF invested just 0.1% of its assets under management or $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, in the beginning of the first quarter, this would have created extreme buy pressure on the market.  The likely outcome ��� a massive Bitcoin bull run and positive returns for the crypto portion of the pension fund���s portfolio.  Yet, this would have been a highly unlikely scenario. Pension funds are naturally some of the most conservative investors. Buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ��� around 208,000 BTC ��� in a short time span would have been an almost impossible task. Grayscale���s GBTC fund is currently holding 386,659 BTC.	1
Isabelle Mateos Y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock, an investment management corporation with $5.7 trln in assets under management, has said that the company is keeping cryptocurrency under ���close review��� as an ���interesting development.��� Speaking to Bloomberg TV Monday, Jan. 29, the senior executive said that although cryptocurrency did not constitute ���an investable asset��� for the world���s largest money manager at present, it was actively tracking progress as it is ���clearly evolving very fast.��� The comments temper those of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who last week went on record at the World Economic Forum 2018 to describe the space as an ���index of money laundering��� and previously implied he had no plans to enter the future Bitcoin ETF arena. As the dust settles on Japanese exchange Coincheck���s $530mln hack, Mateos Y Lago nevertheless saw little reason to discard cryptocurrency investment entirely. ���The fact that interest has persisted despite these repeated hacks,��� she continued, describing customer demand for Bitcoin at BlackRock, ���despite regulators waking up and trying to catch up with this new development and gradually weeding out all the illegal uses suggests there really is something to it.��� Isabelle Mateos Y Lago, global chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, says Bitcoin isn't investable "at this stage" https://t.co/1808eRwzNO pic.twitter.com/8jgKsUH9Jg By adopting a ���not-now-but-later��� perspective on interaction, BlackRock echoes sentiments from Deutsche Bank���s Chief Investment Office leader Markus Mueller, who likewise told Bloomberg that while crypto is for ���speculative��� investors now, the next five to ten years should see regulatory progress allow its treatment as a ���established asset class.��� ���There���s lots of ways to get in; the question is, are they safe?��� Mateos Y Lago continued on Blockchain and ICO investment opportunities, saying it was ���hard to put a fair value��� on them for regular investors.	0
Although Aug. 1 is still hours away, most Bitcoin users are more confident of the community than they were a few weeks ago. As a matter of fact, some sections of the community are expecting the cryptocurrency to achieve new all-time highs in terms of price. Due to the intensity of the scaling debate within the community, several gloomy predictions arose about the future of the cryptocurrency. In retrospect, such debates and predictions may be seen as a blessing in disguise even though it is not Uhuru yet for Bitcoin users. The curiosity generated by the level of debate between factions of the community motivated Bitcoin users to seek knowledge of the technology as a whole. Also, as users try to protect their digital assets, they sought clarity about the entire process and the various possible consequence of any eventual outcome. One group that has played a huge role in creating awareness about developments in the Bitcoin community are the services providers. These service providers include exchanges, wallet vendors (especially hardware wallets) among others. Kumar Gaurav, Founder of Cashaa - Auxesis group, tells Cointelegraph: ���Whereas in the next couple of hours some may still sell their Bitcoin due to uncertainty or not knowing how to deal with the situation, it is more likely we see Bitcoin increasing over $3,000 and to all-time-highs, as there has been plenty of information and guidance concerning this time so the majority of the community is well-prepared.��� Gaurav notes that some other reasons that may be responsible for the prevailing attitude within the ecosystem include: However, he also recognizes that Bitcoin users can expect possible uncertainty at some point within the period, a phenomenon which he expects to settle after a few days. Gaurav advises users not to be worried if there is an initial decline in Bitcoin price. He explains that such would only reflect a portion of the community investing in BCC in the beginning, a factor likely to be surpassed by the longer term factors in favor of Bitcoin mentioned above. Looking into the future, Gaurav notes that BCC may eventually grow into one of the largest altcoins, comparable to how Ethereum Classic became the seventh largest altcoin, starting from $0.75 and currently being around $13. Thus it may be advisable not immediately dump the new coin but wait and see if this replicates.	2
The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, could be the richest celebrities in terms of Bitcoin investments as of late October 2017, as their one percent total holdings of the leading digital currency are already worth more than $1 bln. The twins became infamous for their legal dispute with Mark Zuckerberg over the latter���s alleged stealing of their original concept for the Facebook social network. In a Twitter post, freelance journalist Sid Kalla claimed that the Winklevoss twins are already Bitcoin billionaires as the market value of the leading cryptocurrency already reached the $100 bln mark. As Bitcoin touches $100 billion in value, don't forget that the Winklevoss twins are officially Bitcoin billionaires (1% BTC supply) The Winklevoss twins claimed that they first learned about the oldest digital currency in 2012. In 2013, they announced that they had purchased one percent of the total supply (120,000 BTC) of Bitcoin at the time. In late 2013, the twins stated in an interview that they did not sell any of their Bitcoins and they keep their wallets in different safes around the world on universal serial bus (USB) drives. In their announcement in a Reddit AMA, the twins claimed that they were immediately impressed by Bitcoin when they first heard about it in 2012 due to its elegance and very huge potential. ���We first learned about Bitcoin in 2012. Perhaps where you���d least expect ��� on an island off the coast of Spain in the middle of August. Our first impression was that this was either going to be really big or a complete zero. We were immediately taken in by Bitcoin���s elegance and enormous promise, and as we started to learn more, we became convinced that Bitcoin was the future of money.��� The twins launched their Gemini Bitcoin exchange in 2015.	1
The IOTA team clarified this week that it has no formal partnership with Microsoft, following the wide misinterpretation of a quote from Microsoft on IOTA���s official blog included in an announcement about IOTA���s Data Marketplace. The quote from Microsoft seemed to indicate an official partnership between the two companies and investors reacted to the news accordingly. The exact quote from Microsoft Blockchain specialist, Omkar Naik, reads: ���We are excited to partner with the IOTA Foundation and proud to be associated with its new data marketplace initiative.��� In an email interview IOTA co-founder, Dominik Schiener, defended his company���s role in the misunderstanding noting that they included Microsoft in a list of Marketplace ���participants���: ���We have never mentioned that any of the companies which are participating in the marketplace are our ���partners���. We call them participants���. When asked for clarification about the nature of their involvement in IOTA���s Data Marketplace, a Microsoft representative explained that ���IOTA is a Microsoft Azure customer and plans to use Azure to test and deploy its Data��� ���Marketplace.��� However, despite the absence of an official agreement, the two companies are indeed working together on several technology exercises involving IOTA���s Tangle network. The experiments include installing and connecting weather sensors to IOTA���s ledger technology. IOTA���s market share has increased more than fourfold, growing to over $13 bln from $2.95 bln following the announcement of its Data Marketplace. Meanwhile, Schiener announced that the startup is also scheduled to conduct similar experiments with a number of companies other than Microsoft, and will publish the initial results soon: ���We have already begun holding activities with several of the companies listed and will soon publish the first results��� The launch of the data marketplace was just the beginning. This project will continue for several weeks and is multi-staged.���	1
Bitcoin���s substantial $1,300 price correction since yesterday has led to several new bullish predictions for the coming years, with the latest from investment tycoon Tim Draper, who forecasted a whopping $250,000 by 2022 during a speech April 12. Speaking at a Blockchain event hosted by his own Draper University in San Mateo, California, the famous Bitcoin bull and venture capitalist told audience members to ���believe��� the sky-high figures would come true. ���I���m thinking $250,000 a Bitcoin by 2022,��� he said, looking into what he described as a ���crystal ball���, and continuing: ���[...]Believe it, it���s going to happen ��� they���re going to think you���re crazy but believe it, it���s happening, it���s going to be awesome!���  While the crowd appeared to give an unenthusiastic reaction, Draper���s words may yet ring true in the mid-term among Bitcoin markets. In 2014, when prices were at times less than $320 a Bitcoin, the investor correctly predicted that BTC/USD would pass $10,000 in 2017. Adding to praise surfacing among Bitcoin commentators on social media, Draper���s son Adam, also a venture capitalist, called him a ���legend��� for going public with the $250,000 figure: My dad just predicted #Bitcoin to be $250k by 2022. #legend @TimDraper This week also saw a similarly buoyant tone come from Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee, who on Thursday told CNBC he was ���confident��� Bitcoin would hit $25,000 before the end of the year, a prediction he has made before.	2
Chinese mining hardware giant Bitmain has reportedly made higher profits in 2017 than long time American graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer Nvidia, CNBC reported Feb. 23. CNBC writes that according to a report published Feb. 21 from investment research company Bernstein, the four-year-old Bitmain reportedly made between $3 and $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, whereas Nvidia, founded 24 years ago, made about $3 billion during the same period.   Bitmain, founded in 2013 by Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan, uses Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) cards to mine Bitcoin (BTC), sells ASIC-powered AntMiner BTC mining rigs, and also operates ���mining pools���, a system in which cryptocurrency miners share resources and split rewards. Nvidia-manufactured graphics cards reportedly tend to appeal more to ���hobby miners���, who may choose to buy a conventional GPU, rather than investing in a more powerful and expensive ASIC-powered rig, like Bitmain���s AntMiner. The Bernstein analysis reports that Bitmain holds 70 to 80 percent of the market for Bitcoin miners and ASIC cards, with most of the revenue made from selling the mining rigs, ���and, to a much lesser extent, by collecting management fees from the mining pools it operates and renting out the mining power of its mining farms through cloud services." The rising price of BTC in 2017 especially has also contributed to Bitmain���s profits, for the Bernstein report writes that, "Bitmain shrewdly adjusts the prices of miners according to bitcoin prices." When the price of BTC rose to $20,000 in December 2017, Bernstein reported that the price of Bitmain���s Antminer S9 hit almost $5000. The Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC that supplies ASIC chips to Bitmain had signed a deal with Samsung in late January of this year. The Bernstein analysts say that Bitmain���s dealings with TSMS ���contributed 2 to 3 percent of the chipmaker's total revenue last year.��� After China���s crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry within the country, including banning both Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and foreign exchanges, Bitmain has attempted to circumvent regulations by opening mining farms in Canada and Switzerland, a mining pool subsidiary in Israel, and regional headquarter in Singapore, the Bernstein report notes. Bitmain���s "massive cash position" and the fact that it sells chips to miners, as opposed to mining itself, protects the company from slumps like those earlier this month, when BTC���s price dropped below $7000.	1
Cryptocurrency price manipulation is largely conducted by organized ���trading groups��� using services such as Telegram, the Wall Street Journal claimed in a study released August 5. Unveiling the results of research into cryptocurrency markets, the WSJ suggested that coordinated ���pump and dump��� schemes have seen traders inflate and crash the prices of various cryptocurrencies this year. As a result, it says, such groups are generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for themselves, while others get stung by losses once the groups sell off a particular asset en masse. In the first six months of 2018 alone, trading groups generated revenues of $825 million. The WSJ looked at 175 schemes trading 121 different coins, stating ���[m]any more such groups exist, potentially adding millions or tens of millions more in activity,��� adding that these ���operate in private chat rooms, accessible only by invitation, generally overseen by a anonymous moderator.��� As an example of trading group behavior, the WSJ takes Cloakcoin, an older altcoin that experienced several price pumps this year. A sudden growth spurt July 1 on major crypto exchange Binance was the result of a trading group called Big Pump Signal, the WSJ claims. ���The price of cloakcoin skyrocketed on [...] Binance shortly after Big Pump Signal sent a message on Telegram to followers telling them to buy,��� the research describes: ���Prices of Binance's ten most-traded bitcoin pairs barely moved during the Cloakcoin pump.��� The findings add a further dimension to market manipulation theories which have surrounded cryptocurrency markets in recent months. For Bitcoin, various sources have claimed factors such as Mt. Gox liquidation sell-offs and major bagholders have caused artificial price fluctuations since December 2017���s all-time highs, while others have claimed no such activities had influenced markets.	2
With the help from recent news headlines chronicling the substantial increase of some cryptocurrencies, more members of the public are discovering what people who���ve dealt with digital currencies like Bitcoin already knew. Although volatility is constant, it is possible to become wealthy with Bitcoin and similar non-physical forms of money. So you might be wondering, why isn���t it possible for your workplace to pay your wages in cryptocurrency? Some employers actually do - we���ll cover those later. But first, let���s discuss four barriers that make widespread adoption of that payment method difficult. One of the main federal regulations that cover employee wages in the US is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). It stipulates that employers must meet at least some of their minimum-wage requirements by paying workers with cash or checks - as of now, Bitcoin payments don���t apply and the same is true for overtime compensation. However, outside those federal requirements for minimum wage and overtime, employers and workers can agree on other forms of payment if desired. Employers could theoretically pay employees partially with cash or checks, then give them supplementary amounts made up of cryptocurrencies. The system isn���t so straightforward in certain states, though. For example, Delaware and Texas are two of several states where wages can only be comprised of US currency. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a statement about cryptocurrencies to remind people that investments associated with them can quickly cross into other geographical boundaries without owners��� knowledge, which increases the possible risk. Also, the SEC may ultimately decide some cryptocurrencies are designated as securities. In that case, employers would have to comply with additional laws for securities in addition to the wage-related rules mentioned above. The rapid fluctuations in value associated with Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies may make employers balk at the idea of paying their workers through these non-traditional means. Similarly, they might feel that not enough merchants accept cryptocurrencies as payment yet,  even as the number grows. However, a BitPay debit card allows people to convert amounts from their cryptocurrency wallets into dollars in minutes. People can then use the more widely accepted currency anywhere that accepts Visa. This capability takes care of the potential issue of someone having cryptocurrency but not being able to spend it. The card also offers a safeguard if cryptocurrency holders learn about market conditions that signal a likely, sudden drop in value. In such a scenario, people could quickly make conversions using the card to avoid holding onto large amounts of cryptocurrency that could lose substantial worth in a few days or less. If an employer regularly hires remote workers who are legal residents in one country and pay taxes in other, the different ways countries view cryptocurrencies for tax purposes could also be a barrier to adoption. In Canada, for instance, the country views cryptocurrency earnings as barter transactions. Companies based in the US have to convert cryptocurrency values to dollar amounts for the IRS on the dates payments occur. Similarly, employees must report all earnings in dollars, even when earned as Bitcoins or another currency. Depending on the respective countries, reporting cryptocurrency earnings for tax purposes could be a straightforward process. However, companies with large percentages of international workers may decide that figuring out the logistics requires too much time-consuming research. If that happens, workers who strongly desire cryptocurrency payments could offer to find out the details and report back to their employers. Despite the challenges we���ve presented, pioneer companies do exist that pay their employees in cryptocurrencies. Notably, none of the businesses are within the US, so some of the issues you learned about above may not apply to them. Geographical differences aside, if a growing number of companies around the world conclude that cryptocurrency payments for employees make sense, it could encourage other entities to follow suit. Starting in February, GMO Internet, a Japanese company, will give portions of employee salaries in Bitcoin.  Employees will be able to receive the equivalent of $890 per month in Bitcoins. A representative of the company said the move to offer Bitcoins as salary was intended to make the company at large more literate about how cryptocurrencies work. Another business to consider is Buffer, a company associated with social-media tools that save time and grow traffic. It pays one of its developers, who reside in South Africa, a portion of his salary in Bitcoins. In this case, the employee is a big believer in the potential of Bitcoins. As such, he wanted to receive five percent of his wages in the currency. The man approached a payment associate that works with Buffer and began a dialogue, later completing research to find a company that specializes in payroll services related to cryptocurrencies. He���s a good example of an employee who was proactive and got positive results even though the company was not offering widespread cryptocurrency payments. If a business is already in the cryptocurrency market, they might even ask employees during the hiring process whether they���ll accept non-physical payments. That situation happened at Bitedge, a sports betting establishment based in Australia. The company���s web developers receive 100 percent of their income in Bitcoins. If you���re eager to explore the possibility of getting paid in cryptocurrency, it���s crucial to be aware of the volatility associated with cryptocurrency values, as well as the possibility that employers may not be up to speed about digital forms of payment. They might require you to research the specifics and provide guidance. As cryptocurrencies become more prominent, finding ways to overcome these and other challenges get easier. You can strengthen your stance as an early, in-the-know adopter and get involved in what could eventually revolutionize the way employers give compensation.	1
Global cryptocurrency exchanges are increasingly experiencing issues with Dogecoin (DOGE) withdrawals amid Redditors pumping the altcoin up 900% in the past two days. On Thursday, a number of crypto users reported on Twitter that they were unable to withdraw their Dogecoin due to crypto exchanges temporarily halting withdrawals. The affected exchanges reportedly included some major crypto platforms like Poloniex, Bittrex and Yobit. Some crypto users reported that they signed in on Dogecoin-supporting exchanges like Poloniex to buy some DOGE to only find out that withdrawals were unavailable shortly after depositing. ���We are working to have the wallet re-enabled as soon as possible, but we don't have an estimate on the timeline at the moment,��� Poloniex subsequently announced. $DOGE was trending, and I couldn���t get it on Kucoin. Logged into Bittrex to get some, and got this surprise!I guess it was worth less than a tenth of a penny (in total) at that time, so I didn���t bother closing it. It���s worth $27 now!Whattay ROI. pic.twitter.com/6CatphcrlE Binance.US, the United States-based arm of the world���s largest cryptocurrency exchange, also briefly experienced withdrawal issues with DOGE. The firm announced Friday that DOGE withdrawals were suspended for maintenance, while deposits were also active. Binance.US subsequently said that withdrawals hadresumed. Binance also experienced a larger issue with crypto withdrawals on the global platform earlier today. Amid troubled withdrawals, Dogecoin has tumbled from the list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At publishing time, Dogecoin is the 13th-largest coin by market cap. The coin also saw some brief hourly slumps earlier on the day. The losses were still incomparable with Dogecoin���s parabolic surge of more than 260% over the past 24 hours. At publishing time, DOGE is trading at $0.047, up around 480% over the past seven days. As reported by Cointelegraph, Dogecoin���s ongoing rally has likely been orchestrated by the same Reddit group that short-squeezed stocks of GameStop and other firms. Robinhood suspended GameStop trading on Thursday. At publishing time, Dogecoin is trending on Twitter, with nearly 800,000 mentions on the social media platform, compared with around 170,000 tweets about Bitcoin (BTC).	1
Crypto wallet provider Exodus recently received the green light from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to sell shares of its operation.  According to a public statement from Exodus on Thursday: ���Exodus Movement, Inc., a Delaware corporation that has developed a leading non-custodial cryptocurrency software platform, received notice that the Securities and Exchange Commission has qualified its offering of Class A common stock under Regulation A.���  The shares hit the market last night in the U.S. and are available through the wallet itself. For many years, Exodus has existed as a desktop wallet for crypto users, compatible with an array of digital assets. The wallet also hosts a feature that allows users to swap between assets within the wallet. Now, according to the statement, users can buy Exodus shares through the app as well.  Exodus filed with the SEC for a Regulation A offering in February, as detailed in its related paperwork. Regulation A offers a form of exemption under which entities can sell unregistered shares, based on information from Investor.gov.  The Thursday statement notes a price of $27.42 per unit of Class A common stock. Buyers can pick up as little as a single share, or as much as 2,733,229 shares. ���All investors must be registered with the Exodus transfer agent Securitize,��� the statement noted, pointing toward two avenues for registration: through Securitize or in the Exodus wallet itself.  Shares can only be purchased by U.S. residents. Arizona, Florida and Texas folks, however, cannot participate. The statement also added: Crypto companies going mainstream has been hot news as of late, with Coinbase���s direct listing on the horizon, expected to occur on April 14.  Quotes in this article taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited.	1
The Bitcoin network mempool shrank to its smallest size since mid-October this week after the network���s hash power soared.  The clear mempool meant that that thousands of stuck transactions pending confirmation were included in recent blocks, leaving very few unconfirmed transactions still outstanding.  The spike in hash power has been attributed to the re-activation of China-based miners who migrated from Sichuan after the end of the province���s rainy season. Bitcoin���s hash rate increased by 42% over a two day period, Nov. 9 and 10. A smaller mempool is good news for regular Bitcoin users, as it reduces competition among fresh transactions to get included in upcoming blocks. Reduced competition in the mempool helps to drive down Bitcoin transaction fees, as miners can potentially include all transactions in the mempool irrespective of their individual fee amounts. Mempool cleared for the first time since October 20th in the weee morning hours. pic.twitter.com/JWMs3NsK7v Average Bitcoin transaction fees reached a peak of $13.16 per transaction on Oct. 30, when more than 140,000 transactions were pending in the mempool. The influx of new hash power over the weekend allowed Bitcoin blocks to be found faster than the benchmark speed of 10 minutes per block due to the network���s relatively low mining difficulty. This allowed miners to reduce the number of unconfirmed transactions to zero on Nov. 9. As of this writing, there were approximately 6,000 transactions in the mempool with a median fee of 3 satoshis per byte or roughly $0.11. Some users have reported fees as low as 1 sat/byte for transactions that have confirmed within a few hours. Mining difficulty was expected to increase upon the next adjustment to account for the network���s increased hash power, which would mean the current respite from high fees may be short lived. However the hash rate is currently volatile and has dropped 37 exahashes per second in the past day.  The mempool has cleared. Send 'em if you got 'em.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/XDmDquaUzS Bitcoin transaction fees had been comparatively low through the second half of 2020. During the last week of October, the price of BTC consolidated above the $13,000 mark for the first time since December 2017 ��� coinciding with a massive increase in transactions being sent to the mempool and resulting in a backlog of unconfirmed transactions. With network activity subsiding over the course of a bullish week, Bitcoin users are being encouraged to take advantage of current conditions by performing transactions that may be too expensive to perform with higher fees, such as opening Lightning Network channels and consolidating inputs.	1
Cybersecurity Expert John McAfee has warned of advances in hacking methods after his personal Twitter account was hijacked to promote a number of alternate cryptocurrencies last week. The founder of computer security company McAfee had regularly been posting a ���Coin Of The Day��� review on his Twitter page. The hackers gained access to his account by changing his phone number to request a new password. They then posted a series of Tweets using McAfee���s profile to promote a number of coins on Dec. 28, as cypherpunk Jameson Lopp shared on Twitter:  Speaking to RT after the incident, McAfee said he had no control over the situation. ���What happened is brand new to me. They managed to hack AT&T to move my phone number to another phone��� The series of tweets saw the value of the cryptocurrencies touted rise in value - and McAfee believes the hackers would have made a lot of money in the process. ���Why would they do that? Because I was issuing every day a recommendation for new alternative coins, alternative to Bitcoins cryptocurrencies. People would invest hundreds of dollars into these coins. What the hacker did was to recommended six different coins within six minutes and invested, I���m sure, much money beforehand into those.��� The cybersecurity expert speculated that the hack may have been an inside job. He suggested that an AT&T official was bribed to give the hackers access to his account. McAfee also estimated that the hackers may have made millions of dollars, which would easily compensate any bribe needed to carry out the attack. McAfee only regained access to his Twitter account three days later. He posted a couple of tweets confirming that his account had been compromised while hitting out at users that had ridiculed the situation. Urgent: My account was hacked. Twitter has been notified. The coin of the day tweet was not me. As you all know... I am not doing a coin of the day anymore!!!! Though I am a security expert, I have no control over Twitter's security. I have haters. I am a target. People make fake accounts, fake screenshots, fake claims. I am a target for hackers who lost money and blame me. Please take responsibility for yourselves. Adults only please. McAfee also warned that cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest targets for cybercriminals as they hold millions of dollars worth of virtual currency. ���Most people don���t keep their currencies on their own wallet, they use wallets on the exchanges. Now, if I were a hacker trying to hack into wallets and get money, I wouldn���t search around the world for individuals that have their wallets. I would go to an exchange and the exchanges have billions of dollars in cryptocurrency.��� Reflecting back on the infamous Mt.Gox exchange debacle where 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen by hackers, McAfee predicts more of the same in the future. ���Beginning with Mt.Gox a couple of years ago where hundreds of millions of dollars were lost... This will continue to happen until people and the owners of the exchanges understand that the world they are in is far more sophisticated in terms of hacking than they believe.��� It���s not hard to agree with McAfee���s sentiments towards hacking given some of the recent attacks. Mining service Nicehash was hit in December, losing over 4,000 Bitcoin valued at $60 mln at the time. This situation once again puts a highlight on the importance of individuals educating themselves on some of the safety measures they can use to secure their digital funds.	0
Hong Kong���s financial regulator vowed to keep ���policing��� cryptocurrency and ICO markets Friday during a fresh warning to potential investors. In an announcement from the territory���s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), CEO Ashley Alder said that following a vetting of exchanges and ICO providers for compliance, ���market professionals��� should also play their role in ensuring the legality of token issuance and exchange. This echoes similar sentiments from US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December. ���We will continue to police the market and enforce when necessary,��� he commented. ���But we are also urging market professionals to do proper gatekeeping to prevent frauds or dubious fundraising and to assist us in ensuring compliance with the law.��� Hong Kong has sought to strike a balance between permissiveness and investor protection regarding cryptocurrency and ICO regulation. In contrast to mainland China, where crypto trading and ICOs are both de facto banned, lawmakers have chosen a middle-of-the-road approach, with the SFC issuing warnings instead of restrictions prior to China���s ban in September 2017. The result has been a burgeoning crypto startup scene in Hong Kong, with major international crypto exchange Bitfinex among the best-known residents. Binance, currently the world���s second largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has also been based there, despite CEO Zhao Changpeng opting for a multi-country presence. As China seeks to close the net on remaining exchange loopholes, the outlook for Hong Kong meanwhile remains broadly similar to before, the SFC hints. ���If investors cannot fully understand the risks of cryptocurrencies and ICOs or they are not prepared for a significant loss, they should not invest,��� Julia Leung, the organization���s executive director of intermediaries continued in the announcement, underscoring the responsibility of investors themselves. ���Investors who store their fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies with unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges should be aware of the risks of hacking and misappropriation of assets.���	0
Legislation regulating the operations of cryptocurrency firms in Singapore comes into effect today, Jan. 28. The new Payment Services Act will regulate cryptocurrency payments and trading enterprises under some aspects of the regulatory regime that currently governs traditional payment services and require them to hold a license. Crypto payment services must also comply with the Financial Advisers Act, Insurance Act, Securities and Futures Act and the Trust Companies Act. The new rules place crypto services under the oversight of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The regulator announced in a press release published earlier today that the new framework is expected to ���enhance the regulatory framework for payment services in Singapore, strengthen consumer protection and promote confidence in the use of e-payments.��� The regulator���s Assistant Managing Director Loo Siew Yee said: ���The Payment Services Act provides a forward-looking and flexible regulatory framework for the payments industry. The activity-based and risk-focused regulatory structure allows rules to be applied proportionately and to be robust to changing business models. The PS Act will facilitate growth and innovation while mitigating risk and fostering confidence in our payments landscape.��� The new regulations require cryptocurrency-related firms to apply for operating licenses such as a money-changing license, a standard payment institution license and a major payment institution license. According to a Jan. 27 Bloomberg report, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid and its London-based competitor Luno reportedly plan to apply. Liquid CEO Mike Kayamori said, ���We welcome the Act with open arms.��� As the cryptocurrency space becomes increasingly regulated, many jurisdictions are setting licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses. Particularly famous is the case of the stringent BitLicense introduced in the state of New York, which the regulator amended for the first time in nearly five years in December 2019. Malta introduced licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses in July 2018 and received queries from 21 cryptocurrency exchanges seeking authorization to operate in the country. Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with the Financial Services Agency since the introduction of that country���s Payment Services Act in April 2017.	0
President Ronald Reagan���s Former Director of the Office of Management David Stockman has told CNBC���s Futures Now in an interview that investors in the cryptocurrency market are ���stupid speculators��� and will suffer a ���spectacular crash.��� Stockman stated: "It's basically a class of really stupid speculators who have convinced themselves that trees grow to the sky. It will burn out in a spectacular crash. All of these latter-day speculators will have their hands burned to a crisp, and they will learn the proper lesson." Over the past few months, Stockman has also expressed his bearish stance on the global stock market and predicted a ���gigantic, horrendous storm��� to hit stocks. Essentially, Stockman has predicted literally every asset and cryptocurrency in the global market to fall in value in an indefinite period, making his prediction and argument significantly weak. Economists like Stockman and Paul Krugman have continuously failed to provide compelling arguments as to why investment in the cryptocurrency market and crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are ���stupid.��� Stockman and Krugman have stated that Bitcoin is a bubble and that cryptocurrencies do not have underlying value or intrinsic value. However, as Billionaire Investor Mark Cuban explained, the lack of intrinsic value is true for any asset and currency in the market. Even fiat currencies that are fully controlled by governments in terms of supply and circulation also do not have intrinsic value, as their valuation depends on the market and the demand from investors. If businesses, individuals and investors decide not to utilize the US dollar, its value will also inevitably fall. At the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit 2017, Cuban noted: ���It is interesting because there are a lot of assets which their value is just based on supply and demand. Most stocks, there is no intrinsic value because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. Bitcoin is the same thing. Its value is based on supply demand. I have bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange.��� It is relatively easy to condemn an asset class or a particular stock with basic arguments like the lack of intrinsic value and speculation in the market. But, it is difficult to provide specific reasons as to why assets are overvalued and are caught up in short-term bubbles. Moreover, it is not possible to generalize investors in the cryptocurrency market as speculators. Many investors in the cryptocurrency market could understand the technology behind decentralized currencies like Bitcoin and their potential to challenge multi-trillion markets like the offshore banking and gold markets, which is sufficient to justify their investment in the sector. While it is possible for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to experience short-term bubbles, cryptocurrencies in general are not bubbles. The cryptocurrency market is one of the liquid markets in the world and Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency in the market, is already more liquid than the most liquid stock on earth in Apple, with a $12 bln daily trading volume. Cryptocurrencies also experience major corrections several times a month, and their values fall by nearly 30 percent on a regular basis, before recovering. Corrections prevent short-term bubbles from forming, as speculators drop off and the market solidifies. This pattern will repeat all the way to Bitcoin $100,000 and beyond... pic.twitter.com/o9Wj4reBtv Stockman also claimed that cryptocurrencies are not real money because transactions are not stable. Transactions on leading public Blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin are processed on a stable network with a well-structured fee system and consensus protocol algorithm. "I have no idea. I mean it could double or triple from here or it could fall to zero. But the point is that it's not real money because real money for transactions has to be stable," Stockman added.	0
Crypto investment giant Grayscale has published a bullish report on metaverses, estimating that the ���market opportunity��� for bringing the metaverse to the mainstream may be worth over $1 trillion in the next few years.  The November report titled ���The Metaverse, Web 3.0 Virtual Cloud Economies��� was authored by Grayscale head of research David Grider and research analyst Matt Maximo. The duo explores the burgeoning sector primarily from the perspective of open metaverse worlds backed by an ���interconnected crypto-economy��� such as Decentraland.  The report highlights that metaverse platforms integrated with crypto tokens, decentralized finance services such as staking and lending, nonfungible tokens (NFT), decentralized governance and decentralized cloud storage have ���created a new online experience��� that���s rapidly attracting new users.  Analyzing ���global all-time active metaverse wallets��� data since the start of 2020, it found the user base has grown by 10x since that time to sit at around 50,000 as of June 2021.  The report highlights that there���s no shortage of venture capitalists taking a punt on the sector���s potential. According to the report, fundraising totaled $1 billion for blockchain gaming in Q3. That represented 12% of total fundraising for the entire crypto sector in the quarter, ranking it as the ���top sub-sector��� within the Web 3.0 and NFT category. The researchers note a range of key dynamics that could significantly contribute to the growth of the metaverse sector, including growing average leisure time and money spent on digital hobbies, a cultural shift from premium games to free-to-play gaming, and Web 3.0 innovations such as play-to-earn.  Global revenue from virtual world gaming totaled $180 billion in 2020, with ���premium spending��� accounting for around $40 billion, with estimates the sector could pull in more than $400 billion by 2025, primarily driven by the in-game spending model.  The report argues that this shift is ���accelerating further with the transition from Web 2.0 closed corporate Metaverses to Web 3.0 open crypto Metaverse networks��� due to the play-to-earn potential they represent.  ���Web 3.0 Metaverse virtual worlds have benefited from rapid innovation and productivity gains. Crypto virtual worlds have created a multi-million dollar primary and secondary market for creators and asset owners by eliminating capital controls and opening their digital borders to free-market capitalism,��� the report reads.  The prices of the native tokens for open metaverse platforms such as Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND) have been on a tear of late, gaining 49% and 102% each to sit at $5.03 and $7.60, respectively, at the time of writing.	2
Disclaimer: Cointelegraph sincerely apologizes for the misleading information about Cardano, EOS, and NEO that was stated in the previous version of the article. The current version represents the real facts and the initial author's point of view.   The crypto community is one where there is a lot of vehement support for certain coins. Bitcoin, being one of the biggest and most popular, obviously has a large contingent of die hard fans who think it cannot be bested, or browbeaten. However, that view must have taken somewhat of a knock as Weiss Rating, a supposed independent securities rating agency, handed out its grades for a number of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin did not fare well, claiming an average grade, and being outdone by Ethereum, but the real story is the difference of opinion between those outside the crypto community, and the lengths those involved will go to to support their coin Weiss���s rating of C+ put Bitcoin square in the middle of the class with that average grade, which, from one side of the equation, must seem pretty surprising considering the promise and revolutionary nature the digital currency possesses. Bitcoin, as a technology that introduced the world to Blockchain, is heralded to have far reaching implication in a number of global sectors, including economy, and finance, but, that promise is really yet to be proven. The view that the rest of the world, that is only just waking up to Bitcoin, has, is not as pleasant as those who were early adopters. Jamie Dimon, who has had numerous unpleasant things to say about Bitcoin, is representative of the type of mainstream market that is still evaluating this new, and intrusive technology. Even at the World Economic Forum, there was a deeper insight into the views of those who have monopolies economics and finance. Joseph Stiglitz, at the WEF, said of Bitcoin: ���We have a good medium of exchange called the dollar. We can trade in that. Why do people want Bitcoin? For secrecy,��� he asked. Even Former US Secretary of State John Kerry, showed his apathy towards the digital currency stating that: ���People are investing in it, it���s serious amounts of money and it���s got value so it���s going to be talked about,��� he said plainly. The support of Bitcoin, and other coins rated by Weiss, from the crypto community became evident when the agency explained the attacks it faced from these vehement supporters. The agency said in a release Wednesday that "staff was up all night last night fending off denial of service attacks from Korea" and cited Korean social media posts calling others to bring down the ratings agency's website. The hackers then broke into the website, took information from it and are distorting it on social media, the company added. Of course, these views are to be taken from where they come from, these individuals are heavily invested in a sectors of finance that is essentially under threat from Bitcoin. These are the traditional money movers, and something like Bitcoin only causes irritation. When a company like Weiss delves deeper into the merits and values of such things, and also hands out an apathetic rating like C+, it again begs the question as to where this rating is coming from. However, it also does not help for a community trying to edge its way into mainstream global economic reaches to fightback on a researched rating. Weiss���s reasoning for rating Bitcoin a C+, and then Ethereum a B, was because the digital currency is: "encountering major network bottlenecks, causing delays and high transactions costs," according to a release. "Despite intense ongoing efforts that are achieving some initial success, Bitcoin has no immediate mechanism for promptly upgrading its software code."	0
The closure of Tezos��� $232 mln ICO - the largest in history - is dividing the community concerned about mass Ethereum sell-offs. As Tim Draper-backed Tezos concluded its 12-day uncapped token sale Thursday, many including mainstream media, were excited about where the project and its coin would go. Conversely, however, increasing evidence of startups already wholesale converting ETH profits from ICOs to fiat is causing concerns among investors. Tezos crowdfunding ends in ~42hours. I assume they are liquidating a good % of what is raised Value leaving the Ethereum ecosystem en masse would theoretically drive down prices, an association made even easier in light of this week���s downturn. Warning to all $ETH buyers: This is not the bottom imho. The party will start when Tezos will dump all their $ETH for fiat in two days. #tezos   RIP dreams ? pic.twitter.com/7xGwCvX55U Cointelegraph also reported today that both EOS and TenX were engaged in such selling activities, the former appearing to move tens of thousands of ETH to exchange Bittrex this week. Meanwhile, Tezos itself is facing criticism from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. In a Twitter exchange earlier in the week, Buterin said he ���disagreed��� with the direction the startup intends to go once funds are put to use. Indeed. Tezos has an official goal of eliminating the need for extra-protocol governance; I personally disagree with this direction. Tezos subsequently responded to his doubts. All eyes will now be on Draper as the startup prepares to factor in its huge revenue to its previously-established and much-circulated roadmap. While tokens will eventually trade on exchanges, HitBTC is already offering controversial private purchasing. Similarly controversial futures contracts are on offer at Bitmex.	1
The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network update, which many predicted would lead to a hard fork, began as scheduled today, Nov. 15. At press time, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited are currently leading Bitcoin SV in terms of both hash rate and number of nodes, according to Coin.Dance. Under the new consensus rules, 41 blocks have been already mined, wherein Bitcoin ABC is 12 blocks ahead. The update has led cryptocurrency exchanges around the world to suspend BCH trading and withdrawals. The news about the protocol upgrade has divided the BCH community in two camps as there are two dominating proposals for the implementation of the BCH network in the form of Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV (Satoshi���s Vision). Bitcoin ABC stands for ���Adjustable Blocksize Cap���, and its proponents argue that the basic structure of BCH is ���sound,��� and ���does not need any radical change���. Proposed changes include ���removing software bottlenecks��� and enabling node operators to change their block size limit. Bitcoin ABC is supported by crypto evangelist Roger Ver, while Bitcoin SV supporters are led by Craig Wright, who has previously declared himself to be the mysterious Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. The SV camp promotes radically changing the current BCH structure, where its split is designed to entirely overwrite the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increase the BCH block size from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB. The issue of a BCH upgrade caused a heated dispute in the community; Wright engaged in verbal battles with Bitmain���s co-founder Jihan Wu, who accused Wright of being a Blockstream spy. Wright���s messages to ABC, Roger Ver, and Bitmain have turned into bankruptcy threats and accusations of being engaged in Silicon Road machinations and child pornography. A continued feud between the crypto communities would have a significant impact on the crypto market in general, while a split caused by a hard fork will affect the entire network.	1
Tawanda Kembo, the founder and CEO of the Zimbabwean cryptocurrency exchange Golix, claims to have lost the password to one of the exchange���s Bitcoin (BTC) cold wallets. On Nov. 1, local news daily iHare reported that the CEO of Zimbabwe���s first cryptocurrency exchange allegedly lost the password in May of last year. IHare wrote that the ���password fiasco��� was confirmed by two separate sources familiar with the matter.  The story of the lost password follows reports that financial regulators at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ordered the exchange to shut down its operations for violating regulatory issues.  Since then, Golix has reportedly ceased all communications with its customers, while a large portion of the exchange���s customers continues to be unsuccessful in retrieving their investments from the exchange. Kembo himself came forward in a guest post, responding to allegations that his crypto exchange failed to process customers��� withdrawals. Kembo denies that his company was unable to process withdrawals because of insolvency, saying that ���99% of the people who have attempted to make a withdrawal on Golix have seen it go through without a hitch.��� Kembo adds that the claims of customers unable to withdraw funds come from the 1% minority. However, Kembo did not deny that he lost the password to the wallet containing 33 Bitcoins, worth over $305,000 at press time. Kembo claims that the entire situation has been taken out of context. In July, the government of Zimbabwe banned the use of foreign currencies in the African country, which caused a surge in Bitcoin peer-to-peer trading. Zimbabwean citizens reportedly have been using services such as Paypal, Western Union and Moneybookers to trade Bitcoin outside the country at premium prices.	1
After the ���very confusing��� remark that trailed the way CoinMarketCap and Bitfinex presented the ICO of IOTA, which seems to be aiming for the micropayment purpose in a growing sharing economy, two Ethereum-based platforms are set to launch their crowdsale this week. So far, the Status and Civic projects��� planned ICOs seem to be looking good. Though Vinny Lingham���s Civic has already issued $33 mln worth of its token (CVC) eight days before its June 21 official offering schedule, Status is hitting the market for the first time. Civic���s ICO allows smaller buyers to buy up to 110 mln of the 330 mln allocated tokens ($0.10 each) - as the bigger buyers are only guaranteed up to 66 percent of the purchase order they have requested. On the other hand, Status��� open source messaging form-factor is aimed at making Ethereum feel more familiar to the average smartphone user, providing a flexible platform for DApp developers. This is all in a bid to ���maximise the amount of daily use of Ethereum���s public blockchain,��� its white paper says. It is one of several new projects that are being developed on the Ethereum platform, presumably with the potential to make it reach the mass market sooner than most users could ever imagine. While IOTA is focused on serving as the backbone of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Civic is building an identity network which will connect companies and users, Status��� creation of a Users-as-Stakeholders network aims to address the problem of social bots and media manipulation. It is an idea focused towards the next generation of social networking, giving it great reach and easier signups considering its social media approach. These projects are likely to do well in the market considering, particularly, their propensity to benefit hugely from the expected increase in the number of global smartphone users in the coming years. According to ARK Invest���s "Big Ideas," which represents the research and investment company���s annual breakout of technologies that it believes will accelerate significantly in the months ahead, 75 percent of the world population will own a smartphone by 2020. With smartphones becoming the new personal computer and the access point to the digital world for citizens of both developing and developed nations alike, Status states that it is banking on several of its related features to grow its market. This includes messengers now boasting more users than web 2.0 social networks, having the highest retention rates and its users now spending an increasing amount of their time on social networks. Coupled with Ethereum���s growth, the project promises great ROI opportunities for investors.	1
Transaction fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum have fallen by 81% and 71%, respectively, over the last few weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market continues to descend from its recent all-time high. The average cost of using the Ethereum blockchain fell from $69.92 per transaction on Wednesday to $20.06 by Sunday, according to data from Bitinfocharts. In the same time period, Ether���s (ETH) spot price both peaked and crashed, falling from an all-time high of $4,358 on Wednesday to $3,183 just prior to publication ��� a 27% decline. Before 2021���s market surge, Ethereum���s current average fee of $20 would have been an all-time high by some margin. As recently as 2020, average usage costs were lower than $0.10. The rapid surge in the cost of using Ethereum comes after the emergence of decentralized finance apps ��� which now make up four out of the top five gas burners on the blockchain ��� and the increased attention brought to the blockchain amid 2021���s market boom.  Ethereum���s daily user count has quadrupled since the beginning of 2020, climbing from around 400,000 to 1.6 million according to Bitinfocharts. This number does not account for transactions taking place on Ethereum���s layer-two protocols. A similar trend was observed on Bitcoin, which saw its transaction fees fall 81% since mid-April when the BTC coin price was close to $65,000. Average transaction costs of around $62.77 marked a new all-time high for BTC, exceeding 2017���s high of $55, which signaled the top of Bitcoin���s bull run at the time. Bitcoin was priced at $42,440 early on Monday morning, marking a 34% decline since April���s recent peak. Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin���s share of the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization, fell as low as 39.9% on Monday, sinking from a high of 70% in December.  While generally indicative of a swelling altcoin market, this figure can also be misleading due to the difference in the size of the crypto market cap at various times. For example, in 2017, Bitcoin���s market dominance was close to 90%, but the global market cap was only $2 billion, or 0.1% of what it is now. At the same time, the global market cap figure can easily be boosted by anyone who can be bothered to launch an arbitrary token with a high supply and even just a modest starting price.	1
OneCoin, a purported cryptocurrency and trading venture based out of Bulgaria, is suspected to be a pyramid scheme with no verifiable evidence to back up any of its business claims. Usually people use Cloud Mining services to invest in cryptoeconomy. Evidence supplied to Cointelegraph, in addition to reviews already published elsewhere, suggests that OneCoin.eu and the One World Foundation are scam operations. The amount of evidence contributing to OneCoin���s status as a pyramid scheme is considerable. Its directors have previously been involved in other known scam operations, its resources contain no verifiable evidence for any of its business claims and documentation uploaded to support claims often conflicts with the claims themselves. In addition, the quality of hosted content, including standards of English and website construction, are noticeably poor for an alleged international operation run by native speakers.  OneCoin���s Founder, Owner and Chief Operating Officer ���Dr. Ruja Ignatova��� is the subject of a host of claims seemingly designed to demonstrate experience and business acumen. Information uploaded to OneCoin.eu states that she received degrees from the University of Oxford and Konstanz, and is the former CEO of Bulgarian private investment firm CSIF. If the resume available at OneCoin.eu is to be taken as official information, it is notable that claims made elsewhere are not replicated in the document. Ignatova���s participation in a Harvard negotiating course is only mentioned on the One World Foundation website despite a scan being present in the resume. Ignatova���s own websites state that she graduated Oxford with Magister Juris in European and Comparative Law in 2004. The websites in question are blogs from Wordpress, Blogspot and Weebly, the latter two in German stating that in 2004 Ignatova entered employment having graduated from Oxford. A scanned certificate on OneCoin.eu states she completed the program in 2009; no document from 2004 is visible. CSIF has been contacted for confirmation of Ignatova���s previous employment, but at the time of writing Cointelegraph has not received a response.  Also working for OneCoin in various capacities are Sebastian Greenwood and Nigel Allan, both of whom have been involved in scam operations in the past. Greenwood previously worked with defunct pyramid scheme Unaico, whose activities were the subject of a warning from Pakistan���s Securities and Exchanges Commission. The notice cited ���illegal multi-level marketing��� practices and advised consumers ���to refrain from investing/ dealing in these so-called lucrative business schemes, launched by the Company.��� Allan, the ex-president of OneCoin, has meanwhile previously been implicated in similar pyramid schemes to OneCoin, namely Crypto888 and Brilliant Carbon. Correspondence originally from January 2015 would appear to suggest that Ignatova and Allan had a falling out, with Ignatova describing ���betrayal of trust��� and Allan as ���illoyal��� (presumably with the intended meaning of ���disloyal���). It is clear that despite the apparent experience of its leadership in creating tools to con consumers into investing money, the claims made by OneCoin are easily revealed as fabrication. OneCoin���s style uses prestige and public presence to create an image of importance and legitimacy. The so-called ���OneAwards��� claim to reward successful traders, who are invited to the organization���s award events. These events also double as fundraisers for the One World Foundation���s ���projects.��� ���OneAwards incentivize the success stories. We award such as Black Di[a]mond and Double Di[a]mond. Being part of this exclusive cirlcle [sic] comes with awards, luxury items such as Rolex watches, Cash Bonuses, and Luxury cruise holidays. Other members will be inspired by your achievement ��� and realize what huge opportunities One offers.���  ��� OneCoin.eu It was the most recent event in Dubai that prompted James Dollahan to send out his own advisory regarding OneCoin���s practices. Dollahan, who works for Filipino consulting firm Worldwide Summit, confirmed to Cointelegraph in emailed comments that a group of associates had attended the Dubai event, along with ���approximately 3,000��� others. He explained: ���They met with the owners and managers of Onecoin and yes, their behavior and things said were just as I had warned them about.  Nothing that could be verified except on their own websites [���]. Regarding technical questions, they were not detailed in their answers and much did not make sense to them based on what true crypto currencies are.��� According to OneCoin.eu, 650,000 OneCoins as well as ���50.000 cash��� of undetermined currency were donated to the One World Foundation during the event. Dollahan���s concern was piqued by a separate marketing stunt featuring Ignatova herself. An alleged interview was published on the front page of Forbes Bulgaria for its May 2015 issue, which OneCoin subsequently publicized on its website and circulated in paper form at the Dubai event. While OneCoin refers to it as an ���interview���, however, upon closer inspection it becomes clear that the material is a paid advertisement. The cover uploaded on OneCoin.eu does not match that from Forbes��� own website. Dollahan circulated an email exchange appearing to contain confirmation of the paid ad campaign from Forbes, which is still being verified at the time of writing. The One World Foundation, publicized as the main spin-off of OneCoin, claims to help disadvantaged children through donations gathered via OneCoin���s operation and special events. Its website states it is ���supporting��� various organizations including One Laptop per Child and Seva, but gives no information about how exactly it does so. A ticker on the homepage states at the time of writing that 73 children have been ���helped,��� yet again no further information is provided. The Foundation also states its mission is to ���empower children and youth to learn about today���s economy. To make them responsible adults, who understand money and who can build up a prosperous life.��� It is not clear how these objectives are being fulfilled by the alleged support. OneCoin���s apparent partner, Aurum Coin, meanwhile has seen little activity since November 2014, with Bitcointalk debate highlighting the lack of backed-up claims and plentiful scam reports. OneCoin is variously stated to be registered in Gibraltar and Ignatova���s alleged home country of Bulgaria. Regardless of its base, however, it is conspicuous that the USA is among the ���restricted��� countries with the website stating: ���Marketing Partner Applications may not be accepted from residents within these territories, or there may be limited payment options available.��� In its review of OneCoin, BehindMLM.com suggests that this is because ���OneCoin would easily fall foul of SEC regulation concerning the offering of unregistered securities.��� What makes OneCoin most likely to be pure fabrication is nonetheless a simple fact. Nowhere on resources such as CoinMarketCap is OneCoin to be found. No information regarding its technical specifications can be easily found and is impossible to verify. Cointelegraph would recommend to readers that they do not commence dealings with OneCoin, its spin-offs or associates. Similarly, any other projects linked to the actors mentioned in this article should be avoided at all costs. We hope that you liked this article. We recommend you get acquainted with our ratings of the top blockchain companies and cryptocurrencies.	1
Huobi, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges that was originally founded in China, has revealed its plans to open an office in San Francisco. The announcement took place during the Blockchain Connect conference Friday, Jan. 26. Blockchain Connect, an event that focused on the cooperation between the US��� and China���s cryptocurrency markets, took place on Friday, Jan. 26 in San Francisco. The Huobi exchange was one of the presenters at the conference, during which they have announced their intention to start doing business in the United States. The company���s new office is already under construction in the Silicon Valley. ���The U.S. will be our focus right now,��� said Huobi���s Chief Strategy Officer Cai Kailong. Founded in 2013, Huobi Group provides exchange services in Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and other countries. The company was forced to leave China, its original jurisdiction, after local regulators demanded all cryptocurrency exchanges to close in September 2017. In December 2017, Huobi announced a partnership with Japan���s financial conglomerate SBI Group in order to help the latter launch its own cryptocurrency exchange.	1
Rather unexpectedly, Ripple officially took over Ethereum by $200 mln in market cap to become the world���s second largest cryptocurrency with a total market cap of $8.5 bln. Over a 24-hour period, Ripple price recorded a 71.6 percent increase, while Ethereum price decreased by 6.85 percent.  Several cryptocurrencies including Ripple, NEM and Stellar Lumens experienced inorganic short-term price growth in the last 24 hours, each gaining 71.6 percent, 53.4 percent and 94.81 percent daily gains respectively. Although Ripple has made significant progress in establishing strategic partnerships such as the recent addition of 10 new financial institutions including MUFG, BBVA, SEB, Akbank, Axis Bank, YES BANK, SBI Remit, Cambridge Global Payments, Star One Credit Union and eZforex.com, it is difficult to justify its 71 percent gain in such a short period of time. The latest partnership or initiative launched by Ripple was 11 days ago and no major exchanges or trading platforms globally have integrated support for Ripple trading in the past few weeks. Thus, to be critical, a 71 percent increase in Ripple price seems fairly inorganic. The only driving factor that could explain Ripple���s latest price surge is the establishment of a collaborative project amongst banks in the Japanese Consortium for cross-border and domestic payments. According to its official introduction video, Ripple is powering the entire network with its Blockchain-based cross-border and cross-bank payment protocol. Japan Bank Consortium stated: ���In order to address these emerging needs, banks have come together to launch the Japan Bank Consortium for cross-border and domestic payments which enable a flexible and efficient payment system. It is the world���s first case to implement Ripple solution in a cloud environment.��� With its partnership with Japan Bank Consortium and other leading banks and financial institutions in Europe such as BBVA, Ripple has solidified its position as the base Blockchain protocol for the global financial structure and industry. Ethereum has implemented a similar partnership-based strategy with the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance earlier this year. While it is still uncertain whether Ripple���s short-term growth will stabilize over the long run, Ethereum and Ripple are both utilizing the same strategy to appeal to large-scale conglomerates and banks. Although Ethereum has attracted the likes of JPMorgan, Ripple seems to have grasped the attention of multi-billion dollar banks and financial institutions.	2
South Korean Bitcoin traders are facing asking prices of $4,500 as the virtual currency���s price continues to surge. Order books from domestic exchange Coinone list a current price of 4,254,000 won ($3805), with a 24-hour high of 5,025,000 ($4494).  The wide spreads are unprecedented even compared to other recently inflated markets such as Japan, local exchange bitFlyer listing a price of 333,200 yen ($2980). On Coinbase, one Bitcoin is currently selling for $2667.53 as of press time on Thursday. Users have presented various theories as to why South Korea���s exchange market is so varied, these ranging from capital controls to en masse arbitrage and even a ���debt-fuelled bubble��� economy. Bitcoin itself, meanwhile, is continuing to produce new price highs, flying in the face of those concerned that a new bubble has formed. Data from CoinMarketCap on Thursday sees another reverse in altcoin fortunes, with only Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic posting gains over the past 24 hours.  On the topic of the latter, Barry Silbert is continuing his advocacy, tweeting on Wednesday that his Ethereum Classic Investment Trust ���will be donating $390,000 per year to development, marketing & community support for Ethereum Classic (for 3 yrs).���	2
There are many halving predictions yet to come true ��� among them Satoshi claimant Craig Wright���s ���long-term advance notice��� from 2018 that he intended to crash the Bitcoin price. The warning emerged from a Slack group that Wright uses to communicate with his acolytes, and his dastardly scheme makes fascinating reading.  Wright���s sell-off threat came just prior to the much-hyped fork of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to create Bitcoin SV. Although there were some true believers who clearly relished the prospect of these events actually occurring, it was dismissed by many at the time as typical Wright braggadocio and self-promotion. According to Wright, the sale would consist of a rolling iceberg order on a single exchange followed by significant orders on other exchanges. Iceberg orders are split into smaller lots with visible and hidden parts, the hidden parts only becoming apparent once the visible parts have been executed. This was intended to significantly crash the BTC price and be matched with a 10x leveraged short to capitalize on this. Simultaneously, Wright planned to throttle the network hash, rejecting all transactions other than ���unrecognised SegWit TXs to miners and our own Exchange TXs.��� This was to occur via the addition of 51% of network hash power prior to the price crash, although no further details of how this would be achieved were given. As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin���s third halving event happened as scheduled, with the only untoward outcome so far being YouTube pulling the plug on our livestream party and a vague sense of disappointment from underwhelmed hodlers. The hash rate has so far been relatively unaffected, and unless Wright was behind the weekend���s Bitcoin price drop, then we can only assume that the halving he���s planning to hatch his scheme for is the one due in 2024. Looks like everyone can breathe easy again��� for another four years, at least.	0
A 13% rise in the price of ETH over the past 24 hours has propelled Ethereum onto a list of the top 100 traded assets by market cap for the first time, as measured by CompaniesMarketCap.com.  Ethereum marched past 12 other entries on the list today and is currently positioned in the #88 spot, between Bristol-Myers Squibb at #89 and Anheuser-Busch at #87. Up 62% in 2021 alone, the price of ETH crossed $1,200 today for the first time since Jan. 2018 and appears poised to overtake its all-time high set Jan. 13 of that year. This year���s gains translate into a $53 billion increase in Ethereum���s market cap, enough for it to overtake the market cap of several household conglomerates, including Wells Fargo, AstraZeneca, Philip Morris, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup. Ethereum entered the top 100 assets by market Source: https://t.co/oDzWrvLl2b pic.twitter.com/63zrsalRfH Bitcoin ��� the only other cryptocurrency on the top 100 list ��� has also been on a tear through the rankings, surpassing Visa, Berkshire Hathaway, Alibaba and most recently Tencent, to move up to the #10 spot. With an estimated market cap of $12.19 trillion, gold sits atop the list by a margin of $10 trillion; its next closest competitor being Apple, at #2. Similar to CoinMarketCap.com (though not associated with them), CompaniesMarketCap.com primarily tracks the valuations of publicly traded companies around the world and lists them in order of market cap size. The website���s ���Top Assets by Market Cap��� page arranges the market caps of companies, precious metals, ETFs and cryptocurrencies into a single list. However, different assets are not necessarily directly comparable. The calculation for a market cap is traditionally determined by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of shares, but in the case of cryptocurrencies, the market cap is determined by multiplying the price of a coin by its total supply. Precious metal market caps are measured by multiplying their price by total tonnage of supply, and therefore are only estimates. For Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin in the market cap rankings, it would have to increase five fold in price to $6,100 while BTC remained the same price (ignoring supply change differences between now and then).	2
Cryptocurrencies have crept into all walks of life and as a result, we have pundits from almost every sphere of influence throwing their two cents into the mix. Banking and traditional financial institutions have been the loudest critics of virtual currencies but the list of naysayers ranges from politicians to actors. The latest, obscure voice comes from Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev of the Russian Orthodox Church. Speaking in his role as chairman of the department of external church relations, Alfeyev hit out squarely at cryptocurrencies as well as the US dollar. It���s not surprising to see a Russian clergy taking a stern stance on the dollar but according to RT, the bishop also believes cryptocurrency value has been based purely on sentiment: ���I personally think that cryptocurrency is a new financial bubble, a new Ponzi scheme, behind which there is nothing.��� His apathy towards cryptocurrency stems from what he describes as a natural progression brought about by the banking system, which has gradually evolved alongside digital technology. The theologian said the church would do well to steer clear of cryptocurrencies: ���This innovation is representative of the entire banking system, where real assets are converted into virtual ones. This paves the way for usury, which the church has always spoken out against, but can do nothing about ��� we all have to keep our money in banks.��� As of January 2018, the overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market sits at just over $630 bln, according to Coinmarketcap.com. While that number pales in comparison to the biggest players in the world���s stock exchange, the value represents the growth in sentiment towards cryptocurrency over the past five years. Nevertheless, the Russian bishop says there is a disconnect between the perception in value of virtual currency compared to tangible, traditional assets. ���Cryptocurrencies are another step in this direction ��� now with electronic numbers instead of paper. We see that among a certain group of people, these cryptocurrencies have value, but this is divorced from reality and this is perhaps the greatest danger.��� Alfeyev also hit out at the current valuation of the dollar, which he claims is difficult to gauge given the circulation of the currency around the world: ���But now there are more dollars in the world than any gold reserves could guarantee. In a way, the dollar is already a cryptocurrency. We don���t know how that currency is controlled, how its price rises and falls, and even how many dollars are in circulation.��� The Russian bishop���s sentiments may not be founded on empirical market research, but its the voicing of his views that are the most important thing at this juncture. His voice joins an ever-growing chorus that is calling for better financial practices worldwide. Whether it���s having a go at cryptocurrency, the dollar or even the ruble, influential people are far more outspoken about the current economic climate. Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology have the potential to transform the way we transact in the digital world and institutions from banks to churches are being forced to educate themselves and take stock of what is becoming a part of everyday life.	0
Bill Harris, co-founding but short-lived CEO of Paypal, has written an opinion piece on Bitcoin in which he claims the cryptocurrency is ���a scam��� a colossal pump-and-dump scheme, the likes of which the world has never seen,��� published on Recode Tuesday, April 24. Harris���s argument targeted Bitcoin on three fronts, asserting it is useless as a means of payment, is extremely volatile, and has ���no intrinsic value.��� He also placed heavy emphasis on the criminal exploitation of resource-hungry mining, targeting by hackers, and the scam-beset history of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), failing to distinguish the latter fundraising model from Bitcoin itself. Harris also asserted that ���most��� ordinary Bitcoin buyers are everywhere breaking the law, failing to file taxes on their capital gains. Moreover, ���most heavy users of Bitcoin are criminals.��� Much of the article appears to lump together Bitcoin with other crypto assets, despite the point of the article ostensibly being how Bitcoin is itself a scam. Harris neglects to mention the political arguments for cryptocurrencies in the post-2008 financial crash context, including censorship resilience, tamper-proof consensus, and decentralization. Harris was ousted from his role as CEO of the newly merged X.com and Coinfinity - the entity which would later become PayPal - in April 2000, just one month after the merger. This has happened amid allegations he was unable to handle scaling issues posed by PayPal���s success, as well as his misplaced focus on ���unproductive approaches.��� Peter Thiel, who became CEO of Paypal after Harris���s ousting - and stayed conspicuously longer in the job - is famous for being bullish on Bitcoin, comparing it to gold and affirming its potential to revolutionize the financial sphere. Yesterday, news broke of an MIT article looking into ways to ���destroy��� Bitcoin, envisaging control by governments or even a stealth Facebook takeover.	0
PayPal announced on Wednesday its entry into the cryptocurrency market, according to multiple reports. PayPal customers will be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at any merchant in its large network starting from early 2021, the company said. The payments will be settled through fiat currencies, similar to many existing crypto merchant solutions like BitPay. This means that the merchants will be receiving fiat, as PayPal will take care of the conversion.  The coins initially supported will include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC), the company said. The payments giant partnered with Paxos to deliver the service, and it obtained a conditional cryptocurrency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, commonly known as the BitLicense.  In addition to cryptocurrency payments, PayPal users will also be able to purchase crypto directly through the app. PayPal will thus feature a cryptocurrency wallet, letting users buy, sell and hold crypto via the PayPal apps. PayPal is one of the largest global payment providers, with 346 million active accounts and $222 billion in volume processed in Q2 2020. It was one of the initial founding members of the Libra association, though it subsequently dropped out after regulatory pressure mounted for the project.  Rumors of a planned crypto integration surfaced earlier this year. The company is nevertheless often criticized in crypto circles due to perceived unfair practices and the amount of control it has within its own network.	2
Jimmy Donaldson, aka ���MrBeast,��� a prominent YouTuber boasting 50.2 million subscribers and 8.5 billion total views, now owns a verified Brave browser account ��� potentially exposing some of his enormous audience to virtual currency. Donaldson is not new to crypto and is believed to have made a considerable amount of money via cryptocurrency investments. The star previously hosted videos discussing crypto before his channel exploded in popularity and he reportedly purchased a $100,000 car using his crypto profits. However, his account was later purged of all content relating to virtual currency. MrBeast also spoke on Keemstar���s podcast about how he almost lost his BTC due to a house break-in, but managed to move the funds to a new wallet.  With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surging in price, the famous YouTuber appears to be making a return to crypto, by becoming a verified Brave browser publisher. This will allow viewers to tip his channel with BAT tokens ��� the native Brave browser crypto. Brave, founded by JavaScript creator Brendan Eich, rose in popularity over the last two years ��� attracting almost 1 million publishers and more than 24 million active monthly users. The browser currently has 528,756 YouTube, 126,740 Twitter, and 69,000 website and Twitch publishers. The addition of MrBeast to Brave���s growing list of publishers has some in the community predicting large price increases for the BAT token. According to Coingecko, BAT tokens are currently trading for $0.254 each, up 9.5% over the past 24 hours. MrBeast is far from the first prominent YouTuber to embrace crypto. In 2019, PewDiePie, who once held the most subscribed channel with more than 100 million subscribers, began hosting his streams on the blockchain video platform Dlive. However, on May 4, 2020, YouTube signed an exclusive deal with him, preventing him from continuing to use Dlive.	2
Ripple has announced an agreement today, Feb. 14, with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to provide support for Ripple���s cross-border payments technology to banks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). SAMA and Ripple have created a pilot program to provide support to KSA banks to use xCurrent, Ripple���s enterprise software solution that enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking. The first of its kind to be launched by a central bank, the pilot program will allow participating KSA banks to use xCurrent for cross-border payment payments. SAMA will support KSA banks with a regulatory sandbox, program management and training. Dilip Rao, Ripple���s global head of infrastructure innovation, said: ���Central banks around the world are leaning into Blockchain technology in recognition of how it can transform cross-border payments, resulting in lower barriers to trade and commerce for both corporates [sic] and consumers.��� Rao added, ���SAMA is leading the charge as the first central bank to provide resources to domestic banks that want to enable instant payments using Ripple���s innovative blockchain solution.��� Ripple has partnerships with over 100 financial institutions, most recently last week partnering with LianLian International, a China-based payment services provider.	2
Bitcoin has gained significant media attention in recent days, in line with its price rise to nearly $50,000, the institutional implications of Tesla���s recent $1.5B purchase. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who previously worked as a risk analyst and options trader, views Bitcoin (BTC) less than optimistically, however. ���I've been getting rid of my BTC,��� Taleb said in a tweet on Friday, as reported by BNN Bloomberg. ���Why? A currency is never supposed to be more volatile than what you buy & sell with it,��� he explained, also noting:  Taleb���s logic keys in on Bitcoin as a currency, not a store of value ��� though the latter has redefined the digital asset���s role in some ways in recent years, at least according to multiple crypto industry players. Some folks, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver, have argued that BTC was meant to serve as a payment method. Ver often posits that Bitcoin���s current framework does not allow for such a transactional role, echoing some of Taleb���s concerns.  Gold advocate and finance commentator Peter Schiff also often speaks out against Bitcoin, although a growing number of mainstream companies obviously think differently, seeing value in the digital asset.  One of Bitcoin���s biggest recent proponents, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, views Bitcoin as a method of preserving value while other assets and currencies become worth less.	1
Bitcoin has advanced $1,000 higher in what is becoming an almost daily occurrence for the virtual currency. Data from Coinmarketcap shows an average exchange price of $15,200 at press time Thursday, marking an astounding advance of over $6,000 in less than a week. Wide spreads on exchanges due to volatility accompanying wild upticks means many exchanges are trading $500 or more below Coinmarketcap���s rating. As an example, currently the difference in the price of one BTC on Bitfinex and Coinbase is over $1,000 at $14,250 and $15,400 respectively. New all-time highs now come and go in the blink of an eye as Bitcoin adds $1,000 of value every day, beating even more optimistic short-term forecasts from the likes of Max Keiser. Not just USD, but other currencies are also seeing milestones, such as Russia���s ruble today, now trading at 1,000,000:1 versus BTC. New price predictions are now hard to form, with regular commentators instead advising new investors to educate themselves on cryptocurrency or simply plumping for memes. For anyone who is newly interested in #Bitcoin, instead of going and blindly buying it, go instead and learn. Watch a couple docs. Read a book or 20 articles. The price is fun, but what really matters is why it exists at all, and the consequences to society now that it does.   What happened with #Bitcoin after BCash forked off. pic.twitter.com/EhnqacIsDe Meanwhile, across altcoins markets assets have taken significant losses as Bitcoin outstrips their growth, even losing USD value as money pours into BTC.	1
The government and central bank in Russia have reached an agreement on how to regulate cryptocurrencies, according to a Tuesday announcement. Russia���s government and central bank are now working on a draft law that will define crypto as an ���analogue of currencies��� rather than digital financial assets set to be launched on Feb. 18. Cryptocurrencies would function in the legal industry only if they have complete identification through the banking system or licensed intermediaries. Kommersant noted that Bitcoin (BTC) transactions and possession of cryptocurrency in the Russian Federation are not prohibited; however, they must be done through a ���digital currency exchange organizer��� (a bank) or a peer-to-peer exchange licensed in the country. The report also highlights that cryptocurrency transactions of more than 600,000 rubles (roughly $8,000) would have to be declared; otherwise, it could be considered a criminal act. Those who illegally accept cryptocurrencies as payment will incur fines. This news comes after months of speculation about how the Russian government will handle digital currencies. While it is still unclear what this decision will mean for businesses and citizens in Russia, it seems that the country is slowly warming up to the idea of cryptocurrencies. In January, the Bank of Russia called for a nationwide crypto ban in a report that warned about the speculative nature of the industry. The bank also stated that financial firms should not facilitate crypto transactions as part of that proposal to ban digital assets.  However, the proposal generated opposition from the Russian Ministry of Finance. A few days after the central bank���s call for a ban, Ivan Chebeskov, a ministry official, said that the government should regulate crypto rather than prohibiting it entirely. He warned that a total ban might result in Russia falling behind in technology. Reports have also emerged that President Vladimir Putin supports efforts to regulate the country���s crypto mining sector.	0
The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) published a set of guidelines yesterday, Feb. 16, for applying existing financial market legislation to the regulation of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). FINMA CEO Mark Branson sees these guidelines as a way of helping Blockchain technology successfully enter Swiss markets, noting that Blockchain companies ���cannot simply circumvent the tried and tested regulatory framework���. He stated in the press release for the guidelines: ���Our balanced approach to handling ICO projects and enquiries allows legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with our laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system." According to FINMA���s press release, the creation of the guidelines was prompted by an increasing number of ICOs taking place within Switzerland, in conjunction with the lack of clarity about how or whether they should be regulated, noting that ���[c]reating transparency at this time is important given the dynamic market and the high level of demand.��� FINMA writes that currently there is currently no ICO-specific regulation in place or ���consistent legal doctrine��� for handling ICOs in the country. In order to assess future  ICOs and determine which laws apply, FINMA says it will break ICO tokens into three categories: payment tokens, utility tokens, and asset tokens. Global regulation of ICOs has been uneven, with China at one end of the regulatory spectrum banning all ICOs in the country in 2017, while others like Singapore and Australia have provided ICO guidelines designed to support ICOs in line with existing legislation, similarly to FINMA���s proposal. Most ICO regulation globally comes with a warning to investors about the potential of encountering fraud when participating in this relatively new fundraising approach. FINMA���s press release ends by drawing attention to the risks associated with ICOs in terms of the market���s price volatility and the potentially uncertain legal nature of contracts made with Blockchain technology.	0
Talk about investing in Bitcoin and the news of people becoming ���bitcoinnaires��� are almost everywhere these days ��� newspapers, TV���s, radio, and the Internet. However, one thing is missing from these stories: the tax man. The IRS began issuing guidance on taxation of Bitcoin in March 2014. At that time, the agency announced that Bitcoin would be treated as property, with loss or gains being treated as capital loss or capital gains for tax purposes. Readers are probably familiar with the many ���rags-to-riches��� stories about Bitcoin investors becoming millionaires almost overnight. Such stories abound, from the Idaho teenager who turned $1,000 into $1.1 mln and the Norwegian engineer who made $800,000 in profit off a $24 investment. None of these stories mention the taxes these individuals paid...or didn���t pay. Given Bitcoin���s crypto-anarchist roots, it���s perhaps not surprising that some seem to take the idea of taxation lightly. Many believe that since Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, there���s no way the IRS will find out about their taxable gains. Yet they may be wrong. Bitcoin isn���t as anonymous as many think, as evidenced by the number of people in federal prison who paid in Bitcoin for child pornography or illegal drugs. There are a number of companies that scour the Blockchain, seeking to link Bitcoin accounts to their actual owners. Earlier this month, the IRS was found to have been partnering with a company called Chainalysis to double down on its efforts to monitor Bitcoin traders who engage in high frequency and volume trading. The IRS has recently been focusing on Coinbase, demanding that the exchange reveal the identity of anybody who traded more than $20,000 in Bitcoin per year between 2013 and 2015. The IRS is probably correct in their belief that many Bitcoin owners are evading taxes. In the year 2015, only 802 Americans told the IRS about their Bitcoin-related capital gains or losses, according to Fortune.   Founded in 2014, Chainalysis is an anti-money laundering software for Bitcoin. Through its formal partnerships with Europol and other international law enforcement agencies, Chainalysis��� investigative tools have been ���used globally to successfully track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cybercriminals.��� It���s important to remember that Bitcoin���s Blockchain is, by its very nature, totally transparent. Every transaction that has ever occurred is listed in that decentralized ledger, and transactions can be followed through the Blockchain using sophisticated software. The only thing that gives Bitcoin any semblance of privacy is the fact that it uses random addresses which are not necessarily associated with a user���s real-world identity. It���s wise to remember, though, that people leak information about themselves all the time. Many people even publicly post their Bitcoin address on Internet forums. If they were to turn around and use this same address, or one associated with it, for illegal activity then their identity could be unmasked. Given that 2017 has been a banner year for cryptocurrencies, it wouldn���t be surprising to see Bitcoin and other digital currencies high on the IRS��� list of priorities.	0
Ethereum���s London upgrade is set to activate on Thursday, according to the countdown available on Ethereum.org. ���The London upgrade is scheduled to go live on Ethereum in August 2021, on block 12,965,000,��� Ethereum.org reads. ���It will introduce EIP-1559, which reforms the transaction fee market, along with changes to how gas refunds are handled and the Ice Age schedule.��� Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, or EIP-1559, will directly affect how the network handles transaction fees. Going forward, each transaction will burn a base fee, thereby decreasing the asset's circulating supply and giving users the option of including a tip to help incentivize speedier confirmations proportionate to network demand. The London fork will also introduce other EIPs, such as EIP-3541, according to a blog post from the Ethereum Foundation in mid-July. Twitter user korpi pointed out a number of notable points regarding EIP-1559 in a tweet thread on Monday. EIP-1559 is scheduled to go live this week and I still see a lot of wrong takes on its impact. Remember:- It doesn't make $ETH deflationary by default.- It doesn't reduce $ETH supply by 90%, referred as "triple halving".- It's still very bullish for $ETH.Why?  ���What everyone is excited about is $ETH burn,��� korpi said in the tweet thread after discussing a number of other points regarding the Ethereum upgrade. Korpi added: Ethereum���s London hard fork is part of its Ethereum 2.0 journey ��� which will ultimately change the network's consensus algorithm from proof-of-work, or PoW, to proof-of-stake, or PoS.	1
Bitcoin (BTC) proponent and United States 2020 presidential candidate John McAfee reportedly reentered jail this week just a day after his release in the Dominican Republic. Tweeting photographs of his confinement July 26, McAfee said he had been arrested a second time, but did not give details about the exact circumstances.  The entrepreneur, his wife and entourage fell victim to law enforcement when their boat docked in the Dominican Republic earlier this week. McAfee then spent four days behind bars before walking free.  On Twitter, he had promised followers an update on his location and future plans, something which did not materialize.  ���My second arrest in one week ��� a record I think,��� he subsequently wrote on his return to custody. The photographs, he claimed, were made possible because the group had smuggled their mobile telephones into the holding facility.  Speaking to tech news publication CNET, McAfee���s campaign manager, Rob Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Loggia-Ramirez, who previously issued Twitter updates on McAfee���s behalf, subsequently said he is not under arrest, but merely detained. Despite being wanted by the U.S., McAfee plans to run for president on a broadly anti-establishment platform and is accepting Bitcoin donations for the campaign, which he runs from the boat on which he arrived in the Domican Republic.	1
Ethereum and DeFi proponent Ryan Sean Adams has drawn attention to how high gas fees relative to the current Ether price could actually be a bullish sign.  Citing this week���s Grayscale research paper ���Valuing Ethereum��� the Bankless commentator claimed that Ethereum is ���actually getting cheaper��� from a price to sale ratio aspect.  Here's what's crazy...From a P/S perspective ETH is actually getting *cheaper* pic.twitter.com/xyz9yuVCyZ A price to sales ratio (P/S) is usually calculated by taking a company's market capitalization and dividing it by revenue from sales. In this case, taking Ethereum���s $184 billion market cap dividing it by the total revenue derived from transaction fees provides a similar metric. The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the investment (although there���s debate as to how applicable it is to decentralized digital assets.) According to the Grayscale report, Ethereum���s P/S ratio at the start of 2021 was the lowest it has been for over three years at around 0.02. While Ethereum is not a company, and transaction fees are not technically sal revenue, institutional-grade investment vehicles such as Grayscale often use traditional methods to help value assets. The report said: Given the enormous effort going into reducing ETH fees with Eth2, layer-two scaling and the Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-1559, this revenue is also far from guaranteed into the future.  However, high transaction fees are indicative of high demand on the network, which is good news for miners and long term holders (if not for those wanting to use it on a daily basis.) According to BitInfoCharts, the average Ethereum transaction fee has skyrocketed to an all-time high of around $23. This makes using the network totally unviable for smaller transactions which eliminates a lot of DeFi activity for the average trader or investor. Grayscale and Ethereum advocates, on the other hand, see the positive aspects: Grayscale also suggested that the gas-lowering EIP-1559 could create a positive feedback loop which is extremely bullish for ETH prices.	1
The art market is on the threshold of big changes that can be brought with Blockchain technologies. Blockchain suggests the decision for the key stumbling blocks of art market such as questions of provenance, transparency, copyright, ownership, valuation and authenticity of art. The actuality is provided by growing online art sales ��� $3.75 bln in 2016, which was an 8.5 percent share of the overall market (up 15 percent from the year before). Seeing the potential, art startups are already building real-world applications based on Blockchain. These are the key stories of purchasing art with cryptocurrencies and the ideas of how to start your own Blockchain-based art collection. The very notion of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the source of inspiration for artists. Actually, art is currency itself. Its high value had been proved by centuries. So the idea of buying art for cryptocurrencies has something relevant with natural exchange. If art is a currency itself, Bitcoin at some point is a piece of art. That is what a work by Peter Fr��hlich about. The author describes the work: ���Mounted on a rosewood panel, inside the baroque gold-plated frame is a small computer and four specialized computing units producing Bitcoins, the most known and used cryptocurrency. The small display shows the current rate of calculation and the exchange rate of Bitcoins to euros.���  Peter Fr��hlich Another example of Bitcoin inspired art piece is the painting by French artist Youl ���Last Bitcoin Supper��� that was sold in 2014 as a part of ���Project Bitcoin��� at eBay auction for 4.64 BTC. The author of the project Bitcoincito tells about the painting: When we started throwing around ideas for the painting, I was struck that we both had stumbled upon the same basic thought: Bitcoin as Jesus. We saw Jesus as a messianic figure who fundamentally changed the world... and for that change, he was both worshipped and despised. We felt that Bitcoin has taken a similar role: thoroughly world-changing, but also worshipped and despised. After days of discussion, we decided Youl would paint a huge 140x70 centimeter canvas interpretation of Da Vinci's Last Supper. We believed that Youl's painting could tell the story of bitcoin with a profundity few words could even approach.  Youl. ���Last Bitcoin Supper��� Today the number of Bitcoin/crypto-based artworks became very big. One of the cases when this kind of art was available together ��� Crypto Art Gallery event in Manchester, UK on April 9th 2017. As a line up of the event, there was a work Two Minds/One Love on sale for five BTC. Bitcoin inspired art by its atmosphere can be compared with street art. They have equal ideas of existence on the fringes of the law; rejecting official institutions like art galleries, museums, art schools or banks; being generalized, controlled and sustaining by independent, often anonymous, artistic community and society. Moniker Art Fair that is known to specialize in street art and urban culture in 2015 became a pioneer in using Bitcoin in an art fair context. The tickets to the Fair were available for Bitcoins and visitors had the opportunity to learn about cryptocurrency through 15 meters interactive installation titled ���The Renaissance is Now.��� The installation included a Bitcoin ATM for anyone inspired to try out the digital currency on the spot.  ���The Renaissance is Now��� Bitcoin installation for Moniker Art Fair 2015 - sponsored by Kaspersky Another cryptocurrency project that inherits anonymity of street artists is called Scarab. The Scarab Experiment is an attempt to create a kind of ���virtual artist��� using decentralized technology. Scarab is an artist as persona formed through community, which removes the individual identity and creates a collective artist. One becomes Scarab by participating in the community through making artwork for submission and/or by voting. Artists compete for their art to be officially signed and sold as a ���Scarab��� piece. Participants in the experiment will jointly create a new artistic personae, complete with a portfolio of up to 50 pieces of work. To be able to participate and become a part of the community one need to hold at least one Scarab Token. When a piece of artwork is sold, all token holders will receive a royalty payment as a reward for their participation. Together with spontaneously developing Bitcoin-related art, there are cases of implementation Blockchain and cryptocurrencies in traditional art institutions. The first case goes back to 2015 when Austrian museum of applied art MAK purchased an online installation, an algorithmically-generated screen saver by Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel ���Event listeners.���This screensaver became the first piece of art ever to be sold for Bitcoin to a museum.  Short screen capture of Event Listeners, OSX Screensaver by Harm van den Dorpel, 2015 If purchasing art for Bitcoins is yet too radical to be normal practice for museums, Blockchain technology itself is much more acceptable by official art institutions. From Sept. 1-10, 2017 the State Central Museum of Contemporary History of Russia in Moscow hosted the world���s first CryptoArt, an exhibition project organized by Rudanovsky Foundation. The Foundation presented a qualitatively new platform for art communication based on the works of the contemporary artist Svetlana Smirnova. Each picture was provided with an open digital VerisArt certificate, based on Blockchain technology. With Blockchain it is impossible to destroy or falsify the primary detailed information about works of art, provenance and history of displacement. This provides the basis for true security and transparency. Technology gives access for open and transparent relations among museums, auction houses, galleries, collectors, art historians and researchers. There are fans of the idea to sell art for cryptocurrencies in gallery business also. In summer 2017 Dadiani Fine Art became the first gallery in Britain to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for works of art. Buyers at the Cork Street gallery in the heart of Mayfair���s traditional art district will be able to use any of the following six cryptocurrencies on the market: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ripple, Litecoin and Dash. One of the works that can be bought with cryptocurrencies in Dadiani Fine Art gallery is a series of 18 sculptures by Mike O���Connor, each one created from the original Inconel exhaust systems, they are entitled ���The Noise.��� The exhaust systems are from the infamous Ferrari ���056��� engines  Sculpture ���The Noise��� by Mike O���Connor. Dadiani Fine Art Maybe the most important contribution made by Blockchain technology to the art world concerns digital art. Today, digital art takes on many forms, all made with the aid of a computer. Digital art can be sketches that are originally on paper, but scanned and edited on the computer or maybe Photoshopped images or CAD designed models. Digital artists face many issues when it comes to protecting the authenticity and ownership of their pieces, and this is particularly true with images. With Blockchain technology it becomes possible to collect and systematize digital art because Blockchain can be compared to copyright. For a long time, the only way for artists to really build a market around their digital works has been to convert them into physical forms. Blockchain technology solves the problem of provenance and verification of an art piece. It provides an ideal solution to preserve intellectual property, create demand and increase value for digital content. The successful startups like Monegraph, Ascribe, Verisart suggest the opportunity for the art world to ascribe authenticity to any image. These startups use decentralized technologies to help artists and collectors with new ways to certify, document, verify and enliven their works. The Blockchain is used to build a worldwide ledger of art and collectibles, coupled with museum standard meta data, to provide immediate value for artists, collectors, apparaisers and insurers. Blockchain technologies change the major principles of art collecting. Traditionally art collectors were extremely rich people. The art market is one of the most conservative, where old and big auction houses like Christie���s and Sotheby���s are unconditional dominants. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can make art market transparent and more democratic. One of the promising startups is called Maecenas and it uses Blockchain technology to create tamper-proof digital certificates linked to pieces of art. A single artwork is broken down into thousands of certificates, similar to how a public company issues shares. Investors can then purchase these certificates to own a percentage of a given artwork, and they can sell them back to other investors at any time via the Maecenas exchange. After launching the startup in 2018 founders are going to announce the artworks available for investment by such artist as Picasso, Monet, Braque, Pissarro, Giacometti, Brancusi, Modigliani, Renoir, Chagall, Munch, Sisley, Warhol, Basquiat, Lichtenstein, Soulages, Beuys, Duchamp, Bacon, Sam Francis, Dubuffet, Bourgeois. While waiting for new startups that democratize access to fine art, we suggest you a list of digital art works available for cryptocurrencies right now: 1. Micah Hesse. Illuminatic, 2016.

Mike Novogratz, ex-Goldman Sachs partner and founder of Galaxy Digital, has said that he expects cryptocurrency to ���flip next year��� in an interview published by Financial Times (FT) Nov. 23. During the interview, Novogratz said that ���this year has been challenging��� for Galaxy Digital ���  a company that he hopes will become ���the Goldman Sachs of crypto��� ��� adding that ���it sucks to build a business in a bear market.��� According to FT, Novogratz predicted that financial institutions will transition from ���investing in cryptocurrency funds to investing in cryptocurrencies proper in the first quarter of next year.��� As FT reports, Novogratz also predicted that cryptocurrencies will ���flip next year��� since ���that���s when prices start moving again.��� FT also quoted Tim Swanson, founder of fintech advisory firm Post Oak Labs, saying that Novogratz was ���trying to predict something that he has no influence over��� whenever he says ���something is going to happen with price.��� Swanson then added that many companies had tried to do what Galaxy Digital is doing currently without much success, concluding ���welcome to four years ago!��� The article also quotes an anonymous founder of a blockchain company saying that ���one of the biggest problems in crypto is the lack of credible merchant banking��� and that Galaxy Digital is ���well placed to be the first to take advantage of new markets.��� According to FT, Novogratz said that ���it���s easy to get sceptical but there���s something happening��� after having pointed out cryptocurrency developments led by major figures in traditional finance. Novogratz in particular cited the upcoming Bakkt, a digital assets platform created by the operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the digital assets management services for institutional investors recently announced by major investment firm Fidelity. This week the Chief Commercial Officer (COO) of global crypto payment processor BitPay also stated that these two moves from the traditional financial sector will cause crypto���s next major prices action. The COO, Sonny Singh, ventured that Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $15,000 to $20,000 by the end of 2019. Bitcoin is currently seeing new multi-month lows, down about 11 percent at press time to trade at $3,850.	2
You remember the pictures of techy, geeky, out-of-this worldly future in any sci-fi movie like ���The Fifth Element��� to date: tall buildings, strange clothes, and, of course, flying cars running invisible highways stacking up all the way to the endless sky. And I am most sure you���d say: ���That���s too far ahead to think about now.��� It took decades for people to invent prototype self-tying Nikes from ���Back to the Future II,��� after all, and flying cars is a way more complicated thing than shoelaces. However odd that might sound, the future is coming very soon, full of flying cars and smart things existing and functioning in an interconnected intelligent environment which is the concept of the Internet of Things. Since the mass culture seems to have always exploited the vision of the future as the place full of public transport, it���s not a surprise that a great idea wrapped into a number of breakthrough technologies charmed our mind. The phrase ���Blockchain-based flying car��� got public attention. Uber is working with NASA and several aerospace to get the ���flying car��� project off the ground. Volvo's parent company designs the futuristic vehicles which could take to the skies within two years. The Bartini Project, residents of innovation hub and winners of Uber Elevate, implements Blockchain for a concept of vertical take-off aerial vehicle. China plans to start selling flying cars by 2019. The Blockchain platform enables fast and hassle-free functioning of the entire ecosystem: vehicles, charge stations, parking, clients. The aerial taxi should become one of the elements of our IoT-enabled future, where things, objects (small and large) communicate with each other without being connected to some ���central��� computer ��� in a way, it���s a decentralized system as well. And Blockchain is a ready-to-go register for transactions which may happen between these objects ��� like between a sensor-equipped smart lock in the public lockers room and your wristband where a small smart contract is sealed. The mentioned use case is describing how Blockchain would free this simple real-life activity from dependence from centralized databases containing your client entry, from supporting stuff and many other remnants of the pre-Blockchain era. Same would happen to the urban taxi services ��� because traffic jams are the only thing Uber and all the services which proliferated due to the emergence of the sharing economy did not solve or, seemingly, ever will. There is a solid foundation for vertical takeoff and landing infrastructure necessary for the enablement of the concept. For instance, the rooftops of every major metropolis are equipped with functional helipads that are largely unused. Large cities like Tokyo, Seoul and Los Angeles boast over 70 landing pads each. As for legislation, Dubai, Singapore and other modern governments ready to welcome small commercial aircraft will set a notable example for aerospace regulators who will inevitably have to adjust to the market pressure. Besides, the market for urban aerial transport is estimated at $1.2 bln which should be enough to power a rapid progress in air travel technology. Blockchain as a platform enables to hail the aerial taxi and pay for the ride in tokens of the car or charge it in tokens of the charging station. Each time when a transaction takes place, a smart contract is signed, storing the information about the delivery of service, payments and vehicle charging. It is a perfect example of how the future transportation can take the best of available technologies, even though it may sound too ���magic��� to pertain to the real world. Everything is happening now: both the development of the aerial taxi, and, for instance, the use of Blockchain for notary affirmations and real estate deals, backed up by governments and trade organizations. Not many years ago we talked about how unearthly virtual reality was ��� and can you believe we could have doubts now when it���s already a thing? We all continue to stand by our belief in Blockchain as in the technology which has emerged to transform the world. Alexander Borodich, venture investor, futurologist, CEO of Universa	1
US whistleblower Edward Snowden voiced concerns over Bitcoin���s long-term prospects in an interview on March 22, saying the cryptocurrency���s public Blockchain made it susceptible to abuse. Speaking via webcam in an interview with Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh at the Blockstack Berlin 2018 conference, Snowden agreed Bitcoin���s ledger was ���devastatingly public.��� ���The much larger structural flaw, the long-lasting flaw, is its public ledger,��� he said of Bitcoin, adding that he nonetheless ���may��� have used it to buy server infrastructure in 2013. Bitcoin���s future remains a hot topic of debate this year as technical improvements to its network increasingly allow it to be used as an instant, near-free currency once again. This week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told mainstream media that he foresees a ���single currency��� for the internet coming within ten years. ���I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin,��� he added. For Snowden, however, a true alternative to fiat currencies that balances mass appeal with lack of government control has yet to surface: ���It���s a question of how do we design competing systems that are simply so attractive that they will not be ignored by the global consumer base but also the governments themselves who are seeking to compete against them will not simply be able to outlaw them and have that be meaningful.��� Not just Bitcoin came in for questioning, but altcoins as well; Snowden confirmed he had used Monero, while reiterating his support for ZCash as the ���most interesting��� altcoin currently on the market due to its ���unique��� privacy setup.    Van Valkenburgh himself was fresh from a US Congressional hearing on the future of cryptocurrency regulation that took place last week on March 14. As one of the four key witnesses at the hearing, defence of Bitcoin���s core values was a conspicuous priority in the face of opposition from some political sources. ���The fundamental innovation of Bitcoin is digital scarcity,��� he told lawmakers in his testimony. ���That digital scarcity can then be employed by innovative people for a variety of innovative purposes. A token that is scarce and transferable from person to person can be used just like money, just as any good throughout history from gold to seashells.���	0
After a long and cryptic series of tweets on Bitcoin (BTC), SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk elaborated his stance on cryptocurrencies in a Jan. 20 podcast. Noting that he���s ���neither here nor there on Bitcoin,��� Musk focused on its use for illegal transactions. The billionaire has recently been in the spotlight for several short and cryptic tweets related to cryptocurrency. On Jan. 10 he published a tweet saying ���Bitcoin is *not* my safe word.��� This follows an equally cryptic tweet from April 2019, saying ���Cryptocurrency is my safe word.���  But while they were generally considered to be jokes, especially in light of previous tweets where he pledged to take ���Tesla private at $420,��� Musk���s early history is deeply tied to the financial technology industry. In 1999, Elon Musk founded X.com, an online bank that through later mergers became PayPal. He mentioned the company in the podcast, noting: ���If PayPal had executed the plan that I wanted to execute on, I think it would probably be the most valuable company in the world.��� The interviewers then asked what Musk thought about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, given their spiritual similarity to X.com. Musk replied that he���s ���neither here nor there on Bitcoin.��� While referring to Satoshi���s white paper as ���pretty clever,��� he prefaced by saying that his stance on cryptocurrencies ���gets the crypto people angry.��� He continued: ���There are transactions that are not within the bounds of the law ��� there are obviously many laws in different countries ��� and normally cash is used for these transactions. But in order for illegal transactions to occur, the cash must also be used for legal transactions. You need an illegal-to-legal bridge. That's where crypto comes in.��� Musk noted that cash is increasingly harder to use, but any alternative would have to be usable for both legal and illegal purposes, as ���it doesn���t count otherwise.��� Even though he may not be entirely sold on cryptocurrencies, Musk sees a clear purpose for them:  ���You must have a legal to illegal bridge. So where I see crypto is effectively as a replacement for cash. I do not see crypto being the primary database [for transactions].��� Despite the negative connotation from being used for illegal purposes, he emphasized that he���s not being ���judgmental about crypto.��� In Musk���s view, the governments overreach in certain aspects: ���I think there's a lot of things that are illegal that shouldn't be illegal. I think that sometimes governments just have too many laws about the missions that they should have, and shouldn't have so many things that are illegal.��� While not a full endorsement, Musk is not exactly opposite to cryptocurrencies. In an earlier part of the interview, he said that ���banks are in trouble��� ��� though he primarily referred to competitors such as Stripe.	2
We had the pleasure of sitting down with Da Hongfei, founder of NEO, and Zhao Chen (Johnson), head of Biz Dev for OnChain at the Shanghai Blockchain Summit for a chat. Da Hongfei was giving a talk to a packed house of blockchain and crypto enthusiasts at the Shanghai International Convention Center. Bitshares, a fellow Chinese crypto was also in attendance.   NEO, which many call the ���Chinese Ethereum���, due to the fact that it hosts smart contracts has been on a tear recently.  The cryptocurrency is up an astounding 3,053 percent since the beginning of this year and people are beginning to catch on to China���s hottest cryptocurrency. Da Hongfei spoke about several aspects of NEO that were of particular interest. NEO brands itself as the Blockchain for the ���Smart Economy���. This is something that really came across in the chat. They don���t want to only be seen as a cryptocurrency for speculators.  They believe they have true real world use cases that can create value in the new ���Smart Economy���. So, what comprises the smart economy? NEO wants to integrate digital assets, digital identity, and smart contracts into its platform. When the company rebranded from Antshares and upgraded to NEO 2.0 it introduced new features, such as cross-chain protocol, quantum-resistant cryptography, a distributed storage protocol and a secure communication protocol. ���We hope the platform can be used for different front end scenarios, such as the Digital asset wallet, Forum, Voting, Profile management and Mobile applications. The platform also features an open API that can be used for integration with other systems.���  The consortium version of NEO, namely DNA (distributed networks architecture), shares the same architect and smart contract system as NEO, and is equipped with more tools for institutional purposes. Onchain is a legal entity that provides Blockchain solutions and services based on DNA. Da Hongfei pointed out that NEO is the non-profit part of the equation, which is community driven and funded, whereas Onchain is for-profit and VC-backed.  Together they share open source tech, ecosystem and developers, and NEOX, which is cross-chain protocol. ���In a crypto-world where even the slightest bit of news can send a coin skyrocketing or crashing, we do not focus on marketing or promotion, and have relied very much upon the developer community and word of mouth in technical terms. Our team is very tech-focused.��� So far, it seems to be working well for them. As NEO continues to catch the attention of crypto-enthusiasts across the globe, the future looks bright. Recently a collaboration with AdEx was announced, that will be the first DApp on the NEO blockchain. Additionally, Red Pulse, which is an event-driven Chinese market research company announced that it will build a research sharing platform built on the NEO 2.0 smart contract platform. Red Pulse, which is also based in Shanghai will be the first ICO to be run using NEO. The platform will reportedly allow readers to use digital currency to reward analysts and contributors on the platform directly with a new token called $RPX, powered by the NEO platform. Another interesting development NEO is a part of, is the first Blockchain smart fund. NEST, which is built on the NEO smart contracts platform, will be a new fund paradigm that will try to eliminate the high thresholds, high risks, inefficiencies and moral hazards often associated with traditional fund intermediaries. We thank Da Hongfei, Zhao Chen(Johnson), NEO/Onchain and John Patrcik Mullin for sitting down and sharing their thoughts.	1
After raising over $150 mln in its token generation event the Bancor ICO has issued its first major update regarding its platform. The announcement includes information regarding adoption of the Bancor Blockchain protocol, along with statistics for how many tokens are now tradable through the Bancor system. According to Forbes, nine different tokens have been activated in the Bancor system and are available through Metamask, Mist and Parity.  More than 50 partners have also adopted the platform. More than $500 mln in exchanges of BNT tokens have now occurred on the platform. Following the recent scandal at Tezos, there has been concern about the viability of the ICO model. Tezos is currently embroiled in at least two class action lawsuits, with more potentially coming. Bancor���s announcement indicates that the project isn't merely vaporware. This is likely reassuring to the investors who made Bancor one of the largest ICOs to date. So far, Bancor has activated their token, launched their web app, integrated token relay and has now deployed their portable widget to allow users to buy and sell across the Internet. This feature alone protects users and allows them to convert tokens remotely.	1
Recent floods in the Sichuan province of China have reportedly resulted in heavy damage to a major cryptocurrency mining operation in the area. The news was published on a local blockchain and crypto information platform Golden Finance (������������) June 30. Ecns, the official English-language outlet of the China News Service (CNS), has reported that Sichuan and four other provinces in China experienced heavy rains on June 27 and 28, resulting in floods. Golden Finance claims that a major cryptocurrency mining operation in Sichuan has been heavily affected, leading to a loss of ���tens of thousands��� of mining devices. The miners seem ���almost impossible��� to repair, according to the site. As of press time it remains unclear what cryptocurrencies were being mined on the devices and how many of them precisely have been lost to the flood.   Flood-affected crypto mine in Sichuan. Source: Golden Finance Mining is the computationally-intensive practice of using dedicated devices to process transactions and issue new coins in a cryptocurrency network. Bitcoin���s network alone is set to consume 0.5% of the world���s energy by the end of 2018, some reports claim. A major share of Bitcoin mining takes place in China - as much as 70%, according to an earlier report by Cointelegraph. Specifically, the province of Sichuan has been called a ���Bitcoin mining capital��� due to the high concentration of mining operations in it, drawn in by the cold climate and cheap electricity. Several news outlets, including Golden Finance, have associated the floods in Sichuan with a drop in Bitcoin network���s hashrate (total computational power). However, data from the Blockchain.com website shows that the hashrate has, in fact, increased from June 27 to 28, indicating that the floods��� effect was not significant enough to influence the entire network.

Tokyo-based crypto exchange bitFlyer was issued a Payment Institution license to operate in the European Union, the exchange reported Monday, Jan. 22. The license was granted to the exchange by the Luxembourg regulator, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). BitFlyer, which entered the US market compliantly as of fall 2017, already operates in Japan under a license granted by the Financial Services Agency (FSA). Yuzo Kano, the founder and CEO of bitFlyer, said in the press release, ���I am proud that we are now the most compliant virtual currency exchange in the world; this coveted regulatory status gives our customers, our company and the virtual currency industry as a whole a very positive future outlook.��� While the company will initially offer only a BTC/EUR pair in the EU, other virtual currencies like Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin Cash will be added to the bitFlyer Europe platform later this year. BitFlyer traded a total of just under $300 mln in the past 24 hours to press time, currently ranking 14th by trading volume on CoinMarketCap. Countries all over the world have been struggling to decide how to regulate cryptocurrencies, from several US states introducing licenses to operate within regulatory framework, to China closing all of its crypto exchanges. Japan is one of the few countries to officially recognize Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as money, a move that has allowed major Japanese banks to be comfortable investing a large amount of money into bitFlyer. Germany���s Bundesbank has said that regulation in general, which for many is an anathema to the decentralized nature of all cryptocurrencies, will only work on a global scale.	2
Prosecutors in the German federal state of Bavaria have sold seized cryptocurrency worth ���12 mln ($13.9 mln), the highest such sale in German legal history, local news Der Tagesspiegel reported May 28. The sale reportedly involved 1312 Bitcoins (BTC), in addition to significant amounts of other digital currencies, including 1399 Bitcoin Cash, 1312 Bitcoin Gold, and 220 Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies which were seized during criminal proceedings were sold over the course of two months in 1,600 individual transactions. The prosecutors commented the sale: "Since all cryptocurrencies are exposed to the risk of high price fluctuations or even total loss, the Bayern Central Cybercrime Office ordered an emergency sale.��� The funds were collected during criminal proceedings against online platform "Lesen und Lauschen," which offered over 200,000 e-books and audiobooks illegally, asking as little as several cents as payment. According to Der Tagesspiegel, at least 30,000 people used the platform. The site operators were arrested last June by officers from the Bayern Central Cybercrime Office, who subsequently banned the website. Auctioning off assets seized during criminal investigations is common practice by law enforcement agencies worldwide. While Germany raised nearly $14 mln from its cryptocurrency sale, the US Marshals Service raised over $40 mln for 3,812 BTC seized in the course of civil and criminal proceedings in January. Last year, Bulgarian police seized 213,519 BTC after they busted an organized crime group that was recruiting corrupt customs officers. At the time of the seizure, the sum of BTC was roughly $3.3 bln, enough to pay off one-fifth of Bulgaria���s national debt. Today, the same sum is worth $1.5 bln. At press time BTC is trading at $7,101.	1
Another new Bitcoin ���hard fork��� could result in more duplicate balances as regulators only begin to get to grips with Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin GPU, also known as Bitcoin GOLD and BGOLD with the symbol BTG, is planning to fork off the main chain and use an ICO to ���help BTG chain the longest Bitcoin Blockchain.��� ���Bitcoin GPU is a full node implementation of the Bitcoin protocol,��� its website, which curiously features the Bitcoin Cash logo, states. ���GPU mining can protect Bitcoin Key value: Decentralize.��� The first Bitcoin fork, Bitcoin Cash, has become sufficiently widespread to warrant regulatory involvement from the US Securities and Exchanges Commission as Bitcoin holders received duplicates of their original BTC holdings. Once forked from block number 478558, the assumption from commentators is that balances will double again, creating what trader Vortex refers to as ���more free money.��� So I guess we are getting more free money. A friendly fork called BGOLD is going to launch soon. https://t.co/LaiefrizSP via @TechBalt Nonetheless, the Bitcoin GPU exhibits some suspicious characteristics, with its website written in barely comprehensible English and lacking complete information. ���For too long, Bitcoin has been held back by the centralize (sic) mining industry,��� the site continues. ���GPU brings Bitcoin into the modern age with an exciting technological roadmap to enable massive on-chain scaling well into the future with decentralize (sic).��� All links to technical specifications and other destinations revert back to the homepage. A second hard fork of Bitcoin was previously expected to occur only in November with the advent of SegWit2x.	1
Lightning Network transactions will be available for Bitcoin from tomorrow, rumors are suggesting. Just under two weeks after SegWit locked in for the Bitcoin network, Lightning, which offers considerably faster and cheaper transactions for more users, may appear sooner than planned. Tweeting the as yet unsourced information, commentator Ferdous said that the so-called ���Layer 2��� technology would be available ���from Tuesday.��� For users, he clarified, the move meant ���trustless instant nearly zero-fee transactions,��� ���scaling to billions of users��� and ���thousands of new apps.��� What does it mean for you? TL;DR:  1) Trustless instant nearly zero-fee transactions  2) Scales to billions of users  3) Thousands of new apps The technology powering Lightning is still in beta testing, with Blockstream having first tested it with Litecoin transactions back in May. Last week, ex-Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen forecast the accompanying ecosystem would be ���highly centralized��� once operational, but that this was ���OK.��� Potential applications are already in the offing, with Blockstream CEO Adam Back recently revealing he had held talks with BitTorrent CEO Bram Cohen regarding potential integration of Lightning microtransactions into the platform.    While Lightning���s introduction marks a major milestone in the Bitcoin network���s journey, concerns are already mounting about the implications of a second hard fork in the form of SegWit2x.	2
Dogecoin���s status as the top memecoin may be (but almost certainly isn���t) under threat following the news that controversial Tiger King star Carole Baskin has launched her CAT coin.  Carole Baskin launches $CAT coin and donors of more than $500 between 4/19 and 5/7/2021 get on $CAT coin free. https://t.co/rDLoJZIfwR pic.twitter.com/vGdCRJ0iZm In a blog post via Baskin���s nonprofit Big Cat Rescue on Tuesday, she revealed her social token had been launched on Rally, an open network that enables creators to launch their own coins on the Ethereum blockchain. However, she emphasized her coin is not an investment tool, it���s actually a terrible pun:  However, Baskin���s interest in cryptocurrency seems to have some basis to it, with the reality TV star explaining she had concerns surrounding money-printing-fueled inflation and that: ���I like the idea of putting the power of money in the hands of the people, rather than banks and governments.��� Despite her newfound bullishness, Baskin appears to have misunderstood the different attributes of Bitcoin (BTC) versus many altcoins as she said: ���At this point, both the USD and Bitcoin are fiat currencies, but at least Bitcoin and other altcoins have scarcity built in and now there is much more broad adoption of them in our everyday lives.��� Baskin���s CAT currently has 123,600 coins in circulation and is sitting at a price of $8.20 per coin. Since launch, CAT has seen 492 transactions, with a total USD support volume of $206,000.  Holders of CAT will be eligible for rewards, such as ���elite access to LIVE walkabouts and conversations with Carole Baskin and her crew of big cat lovers and keepers, discounts and first access to new merchandise and activities.��� Baskin has teased future plans for the CAT community, which include shared access to big cat metaverse world called ARzoo, a virtual reality collectible game called Big Cat Rescue VR and a new set of unspecified but presumably cat-centric NFTs set to drop in two weeks.  This is not Baskin���s first move in crypto. In April last year, she began accepting donations in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH) via BitPay.  It is yet to be seen if her arch-nemesis Joe Exotic, better known as the Tiger King, has woken up to the significance of blockchain technology behind bars.	1
The Bunny Ranch, which is well known for even those who do not frequent such places thanks to being featured on HBO���s Cathouse show, is mulling over the advantages that could come with offering a Bitcoin payment option. Bitcoin made its name on the dark web because of the anonymity, and other reasons, it brought to the user, helping them buy anything from drugs and weapons, as well as sex and porn, discreetly. Things could be going full circle now as the upmarket brothel sees an advantage in harnessing that same privacy in payment. Owner Dennis Hof, who has seven such legal establishments across Nevada, says he is exploring Bitcoin as a payment option due to demands being made by their high-end clients. ���We have some of the richest men in the world coming in and out of my brothels. Our high dollar clientele is accustomed to getting anything they want here, so when I started hearing requests from them to look into accepting Bitcoin, I took those suggestions very seriously.��� Bitcoin has created a new breed of the wealthy elite, but it has also become a plaything of those already well endowed in the bank account. Thus, it is not surprising that clientele of the Bunny Ranch have their fingers in the cryptocurrency pie. The adoption of such cryptocurrencies has spread far and wide, but it is more than just a payment system for such clients, it is a secretive one. ���Friends of mine like Heidi (Fleiss, Hollywood���s most notorious madam) have been trusted with a lot of powerful secrets, and the anonymous nature of Bitcoin is a natural fit for people who have much to lose if their private matters were to ever fall into the wrong hands,��� Hof added. It would also, according to Hof, cut down on the duffel bags of money that are brought to his door, posing a security risk. Bitcoin had a lot of things going for it when it was the tool of the dark web for payments. The anonymity, the global transfers, the speed and cheapness of it all - back then. It was used to buy all sorts of things from the shady underbelly of the Internet, but now, as it has stepped into the light, its image has changed. More a tool of the Wall Street investor than the illicit arms dealer, Bitcoin has evolved. However, the aspects that made it a success in a secretive world still remain. And, it is because of this, that it looks like it is doing somewhat of a full circle, again being thought of as a tool for paying for sex. Of course, this is a new era and a much less seedy situation, but the way in which Bitcoin moves, it is showing its versatility to corner and re-corner, all parts of the market.	2
User-owned virtual world Decentraland is celebrating its one-year anniversary true to form with a virtual party open to all.  ���Relive the past 12 months of events, competitions, exhibitions, gatherings and more with messages from the community and the results of the #DCLFilmClub promo video contest screened for all,��� read the party���s announcement blog post.  Attendees will receive a proof-of-attendance protocol nonfungible token and will get the first look at The White Rabbit, an in-game club. Community members are also pitching in on the effort, with one land rental service offering a legendary item giveaway to celebrate.  DJ and crypto aficionado RAC posted on Twitter that he���d be performing a ���live��� DJ set: playing a special set in less than 1hr! happy bday @decentraland https://t.co/OxORgmIemm pic.twitter.com/Tgwv6WXmJY While the project has been open to investors and early supporters since 2019, the virtual world welcomed the wider world in February of last year. The project found immediate success, quickly selling $1 million in virtual land. Since then, the world has become home to numerous NFT art galleries, casinos and other attractions.  More recently, new features, such as a virtual casino, layer-2 scaling via Polygon (nee Matic) and voice chat, sent native tokens LAND and MANA soaring in early 2021. The platform also frequently makes headlines for the high-priced sums its virtual plots of lands can fetch on the open market. Digital land is a particularly hot commodity for NFT investors, and LAND is no exception, often making the news for six-figure sales.  It���s been a similarly strong year for the wider metaverse. Multiple digital worlds have made strides in functionality, player bases and interoperability ��� enough so that Fortnite game studio founder Tim Sweeney has said the tech is ���going places.��� Players who are interested in the festivities can hop in now and follow a trail of confetti to the party, where RAC currently has the stage.	1
Reddit���s r/Cryptocurrency community revived an interesting piece of Bitcoin (BTC) history on Sunday with a new thread reminiscing about the time that American software developer Gavin Andresen gave away 19,700 BTC.  A thread started by u/GroundbreakingLack78 took the Reddit community all the way back to June 2010 when Andresen first launched the so-called Bitcoin faucet website. Using the domain ���freebitcoins.appspot.com,��� Andresen gave visitors the opportunity to earn 5 BTC per day just by solving a captcha, which is a program intended to distinguish human from machine input.  User u/GroundbreakingLack78 explained: The faucet���s creator announced his ���really dumb��� idea of giving away free BTC on the now infamous Bitcointalk forum in a post that appeared on June 11, 2010. His motivation: ���[...] I want the Bitcoin project to succeed, and I think it is more likely to be a success if people can get a handful of coins to try it out.��� Andresen played a major role in Bitcoin���s development during its formative days. He was the main software developer for BTC���s reference implementation, having joined the core development team in 2012 after Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin���s pseudonymous founder, announced they would be leaving the project. Although the Bitcoin faucet website is no longer functioning, a screengrab of the domain���s homepage revealed a very basic setup where users can earn BTC and set up their digital wallet. The Bitcoin faucet reportedly gave away 19,700 BTC to users just for solving a captcha. Those BTC are worth almost $1.2 billion at today���s prices.  With Bitcoin amid yet another bull market, many investors would love to get their hands on just 5 BTC. However, that���s easier said than done at current values. Given the apparent shortage of BTC on major exchanges, the flagship digital currency could be poised to go higher in the short term. On-chain data reveals that Bitcoin���s moonshot could still be months away, which means investors remain overwhelmingly bullish. The Bitcoin price peaked just below $62,000 in mid-March before the rally paused and altcoins played catch-up. At current values, Bitcoin���s market capitalization exceeds $1 trillion. Major institutions and corporations have invested in the digital asset as a hedge against currency debasement, among other motivations.	2
A recent study prepared by ICO advisory firm Statis Group revealed that more than 80 percent of initial coin offerings (ICOs) conducted in 2017 were identified as scams. The study took into consideration the lifecycle of ICOs run in 2017, from the initial proposal of a sale availability to the most mature phase of trading on a crypto exchange. The research says that in 2017 ���over 70 percent of ICO funding (by $ volume) to-date went to higher quality projects, although over 80 percent of projects (by # share) were identified as scams.��� The analysts found that four percent of ICOs failed, and three percent had ���gone dead.��� The study recognized ICO death as ���not listed on exchanges for trading and has not had a code contribution in Github on a rolling three-month basis from that point in time.��� According to the study, total funding of coins and tokens in 2017 amounted to $11.9 billion. $1.34 billion (11 percent) of ICO funding went to scams, the vast majority went to three large scammy projects; Pincoin ($660 million), Arisebank ($600 million), and Savedroid ($50 million), which together equal $1.31 billion. This suggests that while a large number of ICOs were scams, they received very little funding when compared with the industry as a whole. Earlier this month, TechCrunch released a report based on data from Coinopsy and DeadCoins, which found that more than a thousand crypto projects are ���already dead��� as of June 30, 2018. According to Coinopsy���s list, there were 247 ���dead��� coins, while DeadCoins had a 830-item long list of ���dead��� cryptocurrencies. According to research conducted by cybersecurity company Carbon Black in June, roughly $1.1 billion worth of digital currency was stolen in the first half of 2018. The security company said that criminals take advantage of the dark web to facilitate large-scale cryptocurrency theft. Estimates reportedly show that there are 12,000 marketplaces and 34,000 offerings associated with cryptotheft that hackers can take advantage of. A joint report from consulting firm PwC and the Swiss Crypto Valley Association revealed that the volume of ICOs between January and May 2018 reached $13.7 billion in 2018 so far, which is already twice as much as the market amounted to in all of 2017.	0
Mainstream media sources are already preparing ���FUD��� on Bitcoin as prices approach $10,000 Monday. Quoting analysts warning of an impending bubble bursting and out-of-control investment, outlets such as the UK���s Guardian have continued their hands-off approach to the wildly successful cryptocurrency. Speaking to the paper, Neil Wilson, a senior analyst at London-based ETX Capital, said that anyone prepared to buy Bitcoin for a higher price was the ���greater fool.��� ���Rather than a commodity or currency, Bitcoin is like owning stock in a company that will only ever issue 21 mln shares and never pay a penny in dividends,��� he said. ���The only way it has value is if the next guy is willing to pay you more for it ��� the greater fool. With no intrinsic value to Bitcoin, it���s hard to see this as anything other than a giant speculative bubble.��� Bubble-oriented thinking is part of a growing divide in the financial community. In contrast to Wilson, surveys have indicated that fewer people believe a $7,000 Bitcoin is a bubble than a $2,000. The analyst nonetheless conceded that Bitcoin, which now has a bigger market cap than General Electric, had gained ���very important legitimacy��� from CME Group���s decision to offer regulated futures trading from next month. Meanwhile, continuing the divide, social media influencer Branden Hampton led the rebuttal, writing Sunday that anyone calling Bitcoin a bubble is eligible for a ���slap in the face.��� $BTC a hair under $10k and $ETH a hair under $500. It's official: if someone calls crypto a scam or a bubble, you can literally slap them in the face.	1

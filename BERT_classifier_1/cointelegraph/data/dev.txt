Disclaimer: A Binance spokesperson has since clarified that this was not a Bitcoin purchase but a transfer from its storage to the below-mentioned wallet. They stated, ���It���s a regular transfer rather than purchasing new BTC, when Binance issues BTC on Binance chain or Binance smart chain, Binance will hold the original BTC as collateral.��� Bitcoin billionaires continue to accumulate during the dip. As Bitcoin (BTC) filled the $42,000 December price wick this morning, Bitcoin whales were busy stacking sats. One address belonging to Binance added 43,000 BTC on Tuesday at an average price of $46,553.68, bringing the wallet's total value to $5.5 billion.  Elsewhere, the third-largest Bitcoin address continued its spending spree, adding another 551 BTC since Cointelegraph last reported it bought the dip, just two days ago. The wallet continues to aggressively accumulate in the $40,000 range, now owning a total of 121,396 BTC or roughly $5 billion.  There was some consternation on social media platforms about the wallet owner behind the $43,000 BTC buy, but Binance confirmed ownership of the address in a tweet sent out in 2019.  For $BTCB, the $BTC reserve address is: 3LYJfcfHPXYJreMsASk2jkn69LWEYKzexbWe have just reserved 9001 BTC and minted 9001 BTCB. https://t.co/344lxlqsMaA trading pair on #Binance .com for BTCB/BTC will follow in a day or so, and we will issue a proposal on @Binance_DEX The intended use of wallet address "3LYJfcfHPXYJreMsASk2jkn69LWEYKzexb" was for the company to issue a number of crypto-pegged tokens on Binance Chain, starting with BTCB, a BEP-2 token pegged to BTC.  However, the wallet appears to have evolved into a cold storage wallet for the world���s largest cryptocurrency exchange. In a tweet by advanced blockchain tracker Whale Alert in April 2021, the wallet was again labeled as the Binance BTC reserve wallet address.  Although the wallet has been used to mint 13,001 BTC onto the Binance Smart Chain, the owner has never sold a single satoshi. Since June 17, 2019, it has accumulated a whopping 116,601.13647202 BTC.  At the time of writing, the wallet is valued at roughly $4,982,770,577, or just shy of $5 billion. Talk about diamond hands.	1
Earlier this week, China���s largest mainstream media company People���s Daily defined Bitcoin as digital gold, further validating its legitimacy. Suddenly, investors and mainstream media outlets across the world have started to endorse and adopt Bitcoin. In the past month, Bitcoin has received more extensive mainstream media coverage than it did in 2013 when interest in Bitcoin peaked. Media companies and investment firms in South Korea, India, Australia and Japan have started to discuss the possibility of Bitcoin surpassing the value of certain reserve currencies in the far future as an alternative monetary and financial system. Most recently, ABC News, a national news service in Australia produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, reported that it is possible for Bitcoin to replace reserve currencies such as the US dollar in the next 10 years if it sustains its current exponential growth.  Bitcoin experts including BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp also suggested that investors and traders should consider basing off the dominance index of Bitcoin on the global M1 supply against currencies such as the USD, instead of altcoins in the cryptocurrency market. Lopp noted that as of now, Bitcoin accounts for around 0.14 percent of global M1 money supply and still has a long way to go before surpassing the value of reserve currencies. However, if the idea and the concept of Bitcoin overtaking existing government-backed currencies to become the alternative financial network are the focus of investors, supporters of Bitcoin should compare the dominance index of Bitcoin to the M1 money index. Still, the fact that mainstream media companies such as ABC News and Bitcoin experts including Jameson Lopp are even bringing up the M1 money index into discussions about Bitcoin is a positive sign that Bitcoin is on its way towards mainstream adoption. In Japan, mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is imminent, with leading airlines, electronics retailers and some of the country's most well-known and influential companies accepting Bitcoin as digital currency rather than as digital gold and investment. If deals with Japanese companies are pursued as planned, more than 300,000 Japanese merchants could soon accept Bitcoin in the country and tens of thousands of convenience stores could start offering Bitcoin as an official method of payment. Genki Oda, the president of BITPoint, the company that led the deal with Peach - Japan���s largest budget airline - to accept Bitcoin, said in an interview: ���We���re holding discussions with a retail-related company. By going through a company providing payment terminal services to shops, we have the possibility of increasing its use at one stroke. It���s easier than talking to lots of individual retailers. We���re also talking to a big convenience store operator about using it.��� The demand and optimism toward Bitcoin as both a long-term safe haven asset and digital currency are rapidly rising across the world. The only technical issue left to solve is scaling to lessen fees in order to facilitate the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.	2
Marketing automation platform Mailchimp will reportedly shut down all accounts related to cryptocurrencies, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), exchanges, news, books, events, and announcements. Industry expert and Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted on the subject: This is the second instance I hear of @mailchimp shutting down accounts related to crypto-currencies. Not ones advertising ICOs, or even exchanges. Just news, books, event announcements. https://t.co/R424TfN50W Evan Van Ness of the Week In Ethereum tweeted that Mailchimp is shutting down their account in four weeks ���because they hate Blockchains���. So @MailChimp is closing the Week In Ethereum account in four weeks because they hate blockchains.   Centralized capricious power is exactly why we need blockchains Blockchain job board Cryptocurrency Jobs said their account with Mailchimp is being closed as well. They're closing the Cryptocurrency Jobs account as well. One Twitter user replied that is seemed as if Mailchimp quickly added a clause to their terms of use banning material related to crypto and virtual currencies. As of press time, Mailchimp has not made a public statement on the matter.	0
As some brand-name decentralized finance tokens sputter, a crop of new projects have emerged that are catching strong bids on the back of aggressive yield farming programs, generous airdrops and significant technical advances.  It���s a set of outlier projects pushing forward that has led one crypto analyst, eGirl Capital���s Mewny, to brand them as DeFi���s ���Gen 2.���  feels like theres a gen 1 and gen 2 of defi tokens now the former is stagnant and the latter is pampinghas nothing to do with fundamentals. its all psychological Mewny, who in an interview with Cointelegraph pitched eGirl Capital as ���an org that takes itself as a very serious joke,��� said that Gen 2 tokens have garnered attention due to their well-cultivated communities and clever token distribution models ��� both of which lead to a ���recursive��� price-and-sentiment loop.  ���I think in terms of market interest it���s more about seeking novelty and narrative at this stage in the cycle. Fundamental analysis will be more important when the market cools off and utility is the only backstop to valuations. Hot narratives tend to trend around grassroots projects that have carved out a category for themselves in the market,��� they said.  While investors might be eager to ape into these fast-rising new tokens, it���s worth asking what the projects are doing, whether they���re sustainable, and if not how much farther they have to run.  The Gen 2 phenomena echoes the ���DeFi summer��� of last year, filled with ���DeFi stimulus check��� airdrops, fat farming APYs, and soaring token prices ��� as well as a harrowing spate of hacks, heists and rugpulls.  However, Mewny said that there���s a population of investors that emerged from that period continuously looking for technical progress as opposed to shooting stars.  One such Gen 2 riser pulling liquidity is Inverse Finance. After the launch of a yield farming program for a forthcoming synthetic stablecoin protocol, the Inverse Finance DAO narrowly voted to make the INV governance token tradable. As a result, the formerly valueless token airdrop of 80 INV is now priced at over $100,000, likely the most lucrative airdrop in DeFi history.  Another Gen 2 star is Alchemix ��� one of eGirl Capital���s first announced investments. Alchemix���s protocol also centers on a synthetic stablecoin, alUSD, but issues the stablecoin from collateral deposited into Yearn.finance���s yield-bearing vaults. The result is a token loan that pays for itself ��� a new model that eGirl thinks could become a standard. ���EGirl thinks trading yield-bearing interest will be an important primitive in DeFi. Quantifying and valuing future yield unlocks a lot of usable value that can be reinvested in the market,��� they said.  The wider markets appears to agree with eGirl���s thesis, as Alchemix recently announced that the protocol has eclipsed half a billion in total value locked:  It is our one week anniversary today, and wow! That was fast! 500 MILLION TVL!Vaults: 89.4mTransmuter: 90.5mFarms: 322.85m pic.twitter.com/FQsezs6s9q By contrast, governance tokens for many of the top names in DeFi, such as Aave and Yearn.finance, are in the red on a 30-day basis. But even with flagship names stalling out, DeFi���s closely watched aggregate TVL figure is up on the month, rising over $8.4 billion to $56.8 billion per DeFi Llama ��� progress carried in part on the back of Gen 2 projects.  The comparatively wrinkled, desiccated dinosaurs of DeFi may have some signs of life left in them, however. Multiple major projects have significant updates in the works, including Uniswap���s version 3, SushiSwap���s Bentobox lending platform, a liquidity mining proposal working through Aave���s governance process, and Balancer���s version 2.  These developments could mean that DeFi���s ���Gen 2��� phenomena are simply a temporary, intra-sector rotation and that the ���majors��� are soon to roar back. It would be a predictable move in Mewny���s view, who said: ���Every DeFi protocol needs at least one bear market to prove technical soundness.��� What���s more, according to Mewny, some of the signs of market irrationality around both Gen 2 tokens, as well as the wider DeFi space ��� such as triple- and even quadruple-digit farming yields ��� may be gone sooner rather than later.	0
Russia is in the midst of legitimizing cryptocurrencies. It is developing a legal framework that will govern transactions using digital currencies like Bitcoin, RT reports. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov conveyed this at a recent financial forum in Moscow. He assured Russian users of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that the government will not outlaw nor penalize people who use cryptocurrencies. It is a complete turnaround from the Russian Ministry���s stance last year, emerging after President Vladimir Putin signified approval for digital currencies. Putin had met with Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin, who ingrained the merits of Russia���s usage of the Blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin. Thereafter, a consortium of lenders have mulled over the possibility of using the technology to cut costs. Meantime, a presidential aide had announced plans for an initial coin offering (ICO). The Russian Finance Ministry had previously balked on and considered prohibition of the use of cryptocurrencies in apartments which it deemed unsafe. Now that it has gotten backing from Putin, and the state has realized that digital currencies are part of the new economic realities, Siluanov said there is no point in outlawing them. He said the next move is to draw up a bill before yearend to regulate cryptocurrencies. Siluanov has yet to disclose further details, but merely said that the Russian Ministry���s goal is to make the purchase of cryptocurrencies covered by law to in the same manner as buying treasury bonds and other securities. As with other technology trends, digital currencies have not won over everyone. In Russia, there are still non-believers. Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina, for instance, referred to the global commotion over digital currencies as a ���gold fever��� sweeping nations, and expressed misgivings over their use as a surrogate for money. In other news, China has not been as receptive to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies. In fact, its financial regulator plans to shut off major Bitcoin exchanges has led to Bitcoin���s price plummeting.   There has also been much speculation over cracking down on cryptocurrencies, following a recent decision by The People���s Bank of China (PBOC) to outlaw fundraising through ICOs, which have surged in popularity.	1
Yearn.finance���s native governance token YFI eclipsed Bitcoin (BTC) price as it soared to $16,600 on Aug. 20. The spiked to a new all-time high took place on Binance and was fueled by the growing demand for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) products and tokens associated with the sector. It is important to note that there are a few cryptocurrencies which are currently priced even higher than YFI as units, but many of them have insignificant trading volume.  Meanwhile, a quick glance at the YFI order book on Binance shows significant trading volumes and demand for the token. The sentiment around YFI���s vertical rally since early August remains mixed. Some believe YFI is primed for a pullback. Others foresee more growth potential over the longer term.  The 4-hour chart of yearn.finance (YFI). Source: TradingView.com Yearn.finance is a DeFi protocol that launched in July with no premine in a decentralized setting by developer Andre Cronje. It is the first protocol on Ethereum that claims to give token holders all the power to govern the network. Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock said`: ���Just a month ago, the yearn.finance token was trading around the $1000 mark. #YFI is up more than 10x in one month, climbing to $10,551.25 yEarn Finance is the first project on Ethereum, whose governance is entirely in the hands of token holders.��� Cryptocurrency researcher Hasu explains yearn.finance as a platform that allows users to execute various investment strategies. He says: ���If you're not familiar with Yearn, you can think of it as a smart bank account that automatically allocates your assets to different low-risk investment strategies that execute on the Ethereum blockchain.��� The price of YFI, the governance token of the protocol, increased naturally as the total value locked in yearn.finance surged. According to data from Defipulse, more than $670 million worth of capital is locked in yearn.finance. Compared to other tokens, the price of YFI is high due to its unique monetary supply. Its supply is capped at 30,000, which is significantly lower than most digital assets.  While the price of YFI has surpassed $16,000, its market capitalization remains below $400 million. By market cap, it is the 45th biggest cryptocurrency in the global market. As such, crypto startup investor Ian Lee explained that YFI surpassing Bitcoin is more of a psychological event than anything else. He explained: ���YFI ���flipping��� BTC price is arbitrary & more psychologically than practically important. What is important is what yearn.finance is doing & Andre Cronje is building in DeFi.��� If yearn.finance reaches a similar market cap of other top DeFi protocols, such as Aave and Maker, its price would be at around $30,000 due to its small supply cap. In other words, comparing the price of YFI to Bitcoin makes little sense since the latter has a market cap that is 568 times bigger than Yearn. Some investors in the DeFi space say that YFI has the potential to grow as its supply has been nearly fully minted. Out of 30,000 YFI, 29,962 are circulating, based on data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Yearn.finance also unveiled a new product called yinsure.finance to target the DeFi insurance market. Kang previously said that the sector has the potential to become a new billion-dollar market. Andrew Kang, an investor at Mechanism Capital, said: ���1 YFI will be more difficult to attain than owning 1 BTC. It's Math.���	2
The Terra rescue story continues to unravel. In a tweet thread, the Terra Money Twitter account went into greater detail regarding the CEO of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon���s, rescue plan for UST.  The thread sheds light on Proposal 1164, Do Kwon���s initial strategy for Terra from May 11. The proposal would better balance the algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD (UST) by expanding the base pool for the currency. The proposal has received 220,000 votes, at over 50%.  The tweet thread also explains that there is a ���supply overhang��� of UST which explains Terra���s (LUNA) ���dilution,��� or price depreciation. As a result, now they must burn more UST: Consequently, there are three emergency measures to be implemented, one of which focuses on burning more UST. 3/ TFL is also initiating three more emergency actions: 1. Proposal to burn the remaining UST in the community pool. 2. TFL will burn the remaining 371 million UST cross-chain on Ethereum. 3. TFL just staked 240 million $LUNA to defend from network governance attacks. The so-called Agora Proposal vote is imminent, shared by user The Intern on the Terra Research forum. In total, the burn should take the total amount of UST burned to 1.4 billion UST, or ���11% of the outstanding UST liabilities,��� the site details. In summary, the team hopes that expanding the base pool for the coin and burning more should save UST.   Point three, concerning the staking of 240 million LUNA, will reportedly strengthen the network governance of the TERRA ecosystem. However, for some observers, staking 240 million LUNA, or roughly equivalent to $200 million dollars, is not enough to save the project. Regarding 3, the way things are going you would need to stake a lot more than 240 million $LUNA to ensure the safety of the network. $LUNA crashing in price and having the peg not restored is also a problem, the longer it takes the more $LUNA gets minted. Other commentators have suggested that Proposal 1164 will actually accelerate the ongoing ���death spiral��� of LUNA and UST.  Cointelegraph previously reported that the crypto community was quick to call out Kwon���s algorithmic stablecoin. Plus, out-of-the-ordinary theories have also been shared regarding a planned ���attack��� on the ecosystem orchestrated by competing players.	1
Despite the present market crash, major Wall Street crypto bull Tom Lee has reiterated his recently reduced year-end price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) at $15,000 in an interview with CNBC���s Squawk Box on Tuesday, Nov. 20. In the recent statement, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors pointed out two major types of crypto players ��� those who are ���using it and have wallets in crypto,��� and those who belong to a speculative side of the market. According to Lee, those two sides of the crypto community should find a way for ���sort of interacting with each other��� for crypto investors not to get burnt by crashes like this. While reiterating his crypto-rebound prediction, Lee still admitted that the markets have ���certainly��� seen a ���negative development,��� which signals a ���downside of the momentum.��� However, Lee stressed that institutional cryptocurrency investors are ���not necessarily getting hurt��� by the recent market downturn, even as Bitcoin���s price dropped sharply to as low as $4,237 today. In this regard, the investor emphasized the crucial role of institutional participation in the industry, claiming that specifically this part of the market will pull the ���next wave of the adoption.��� According to Lee, there are two key factors that will soon bring more institutional interest to the markets. First, it will be the upcoming launch of the digital assets platform Bakkt by the operator of major global exchange New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Announced in August this year, Bakkt recently confirmed a ���target��� launch date for Jan. 24, 2019. Second, institutions will get more involved in the market as the industry receives more regulatory clarity, which is partly ���under way now,��� Lee said, adding: ���Once we have that [regulatory clarity], I think, institutions will feel more comfortable in making bets.��� In this regard, the crypto analyst noted that Bitcoin is ���not necessarily a value asset,��� claiming that it is ���probably best viewed as a commodity,��� and is ���really an opportunity for an emerging asset class.��� Tom Lee had reduced his year-end Bitcoin price prediction from $25,000 to $15,000 last week, Nov. 16, following a massive decline on the markets that started on Nov. 14, with Bitcoin hitting yearly lows. Previously, the crypto bull had, several times, predicted that Bitcoin���s price would rise above $20,000 for the year���s end. Lee announced his first prediction in January this year, advising ���aggressive buying,��� while considering the $9,000 price point as ���the biggest buying opportunity in 2018.��� Recently, Netherlands-based ���Big Four��� auditor KPMG has released another bullish stance on crypto, claiming that the industry needs institutional investors��� participation in order to ���realize its potential.��� Earlier last week, CoinShares CSO Meltem Demirors claimed that the the recent collapse of the markets is caused by institutions���taking money off the table��� due to Bitcoin Cash���s (BCH) hard fork.	1
Nassim Taleb, the author of Skin in the Game, got into a small Twitter feud in which he explained that most investors can���t understand the nuances of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin (BTC). According to a tweet posted by Nassim Taleb on Sunday, Bitcoin is a good idea, but ���almost all bitcoiners are total idiots.���  Taleb was exchanging posts with self-described "Bitcoin maximalist" Giacomo Zucco. He challenged Taleb���s views on imposing central planning by bureaucrats and politicians with "no skin in the game" as the best risk management strategy. 1) I explain in #SkinintheGame scale transformations: Bitcoin is a good idea but almost all bitcoiners are total idiots, can't get nuances beyond fortune cookies.2) My idea is (fractal) State is needed ONLY for systemic tail risks, not messing w/daily life. Same as medicines. https://t.co/xHBJb341Ux The former Wall Street trader turned risk engineering professor has labeled himself a localist: a ���libertarian for higher levels of central government.��� Despite the push for many countries to create central bank digital currencies, there are many in the crypto community who see Bitcoin as a way to break away from traditional financial establishments.  Some early BTC adopters such as Roger Ver have been staunch proponents of libertarian economics. Cointelegraph also reported in April that a libertarian think tank criticized the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for stretching regulations in an apparent attempt to regulate cryptocurrency.	2
As more cryptocurrency exchanges drop support for SegWit2x, yet another fork may soon grace the industry in the form of Bitcoin Silver. Coming less than a day after Bitcoin Gold forked from the BTC Blockchain, Bitcoin Silver���s developers wrote on the Bitcointalk forum they intend to ���make Bitcoin decentralized again.��� Their description reads: ���...Bitcoin Silver will provide an opportunity for countless new people around the world to participate in the mining process with widely-available consumer hardware that is manufactured and distributed by reputable mainstream corporations.��� While no technical details are currently available, Bitcoin Silver will follow Bitcoin Cash-style distribution methods and be available to BTC private key holders in December. The exact block the fork will occur at remains undetermined. Bitcoin lost around eight percent in the 24 hours after Bitcoin Gold, as uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming SegWit2x fork continues to preoccupy consumers and businesses alike. Announcements of how 2x will be treated are appearing almost daily from major players, with opinions varying. On Wednesday, trading platform ANXPRO said it ���will not be supporting the Bitcoin SegWit2x hard fork in the near future.��� ���Security and stability is always our top-most priority and ANXPRO cannot, at this time, support unproven and unstable Blockchains,��� it said in a mailing to users. Another company abandons NYA, @ANX_PRO will not be supporting Bitcoin SegWit2x Hard Fork in the near term. #Bitcoin https://t.co/oX69XIkAb3 pic.twitter.com/rq4KRA8nv3 At the same time, major exchange Coinbase appeared to U-turn on its position to sideline 2x, CEO Brian Armstrong apologizing for a lack of ���clarity.���	1
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon returned to his more critical comments about Bitcoin, calling the cryptocurrency a ���scam��� and saying he had ���no interest��� in it, Bloomberg reported Sunday, August 5. Dimon was speaking at the Aspen Institute���s 25th Annual Summer Celebration Gala on Saturday, including cryptocurrency as part of general comments he made about the U.S. economic outlook. His words were soon repeated in both the mainstream press and online by prominent economic sources, notably Nouriel Roubini, who has also become known this year for his critical stance on Bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, Dimon further ���suggested governments may move to shut down the currencies [cryptocurrency], because of an inability to control them.��� The finance mogul���s history with cryptocurrency has been chequered. Having caused a stir in September 2017 when he originally called Bitcoin a ���fraud,��� Dimon thereafter appeared to change tact, later saying he ���regretted��� his choice of words. ���I wouldn't put this high on the category of important things in the world. But I'm not going to talk about bitcoin anymore,��� he told reporters last October. In January, Dimon kept his promise, telling Cointelegraph in private comments that he ���can���t answer��� when asked how he felt about moving markets with his earlier Bitcoin ���fraud��� comments. However, he added that he was ���not a skeptic��� regarding cryptocurrency. In his recent interview published in the July-August issue of the Harvard Business Review, Dimon again refused to comment directly on crypto, reiterating ���I probably shouldn���t say any more about cryptocurrency.��� In the same interview, Dimon also made a point of calling blockchain technology ���real,��� ������ while implying that crypto is not ������ saying that the banking giant is ���testing it [blockchain] and will use it for a whole lot of things.��� Since then, mixed signals have emerged from other JPMorgan sources, the company���s co-president Daniel Pinto telling CNBC in May that cryptocurrencies ���are real but not in the current form.��� He added executives were ���looking into��� the space at a time when fellow finance giant Goldman Sachs revealed it was working on offering Bitcoin futures.	0
Bitcoin dropped below $8000 today, Feb. 2, for the first time since November, 2017, the month that started at $6500 and saw Bitcoin break $10,000 for the first time a few weeks after. The current drop comes as continuing pressure causes fresh sell-offs across cryptocurrency markets.  Image source: coin360.io According to Cointelegraph���s price index, BTC hit a multi-month low of $7,791.02 at press time.  Image source: coin360.io Support appears to be in place to keep prices above the $7500 barrier, although commentators are nonetheless calling lows closer to $7000 before a reversal could take place. Bitcoin���s losses also spurred knock-on effects for altcoins across the top one hundred tracked by Coin360, the vast majority losing at least 50 percent more in the past 24 hours than Bitcoin itself.  Image source: coin360.io In total, cryptocurrency markets have shed over $100 billion from their combined market cap since yesterday, Feb. 1. While markets appeared uninterested in South Korea���s exchange market KYC legislation going into effect this week, it was the Indian finance minister���s crypto regulation-related comments in a budget speech Feb. 1 that accelerated losses. Despite local exchanges saying finance minister Arun Jaitley���s words did not include any new information on how lawmakers approach the industry, mainstream media and journalists alike announced a ���ban��� on Bitcoin in India after the speech. This had a palpable effect on trading, despite industry reiterations that no outright ban was planned.	0
Exchange and wallet service Coinbase and its professional trading platform Global Digital Asset Exchange GDAX both announced they had implemented Segregated Witness (SegWit) support for Bitcoin transactions in blog posts published Friday, Feb. 23. In their blog pos, GDAX characterizes SegWit technology as ���a critical step forward in the development of Bitcoin��� and promises support for SegWit transactions will be made available to 100% of their customers ���over the coming days���. Coinbase also said they would be rolling out support for all customers over the next week. SegWit technology is designed to reduce transactions times and fees on the Bitcoin network.  Many popular Bitcoin exchanges and services have been plagued network congestion from inefficient use of block space, a problem SegWit seeks to solve, resulting in widespread frustration among customers. The past week has seen several major SegWit adoption milestones. The latest version of Bitcoin Core, which was released for public editing Feb. 15, introduced full SegWit support for the first time. Just a few days later, on Feb. 20, the same day Coinbase said it had finished SegWit testing, major crypto exchange platform Bitfinex also announced full SegWit support for all customers. This week was also marked by record low transaction fees on the Bitcoin network, down significantly from all-time highs in December, 2017 and January, 2018. When GDAX announced that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) would be available to trade on their platform in mid January 2018, the news fell flat for many traders, who would have rather seen the implementation of SegWit on the platform prioritized. Moving forward, both GDAX and Coinbase noted in their blog posts that they���re committed to implementing additional scaling solutions for the Bitcoin network, including so-called ���Layer 2��� solution, the Lightning Network.	1
The men���s shows at New York Fashion Week are signalling a potential start to crypto high fashion, the wait times between shows providing an opportunity for attendees to discuss the recent crypto market dip, reports the Financial Times Thursday, Feb. 8. Belgian designer Raf Simons��� runway show is described as looking like ���the inner sanctum of a boiler room, where brokers pitch their clients on penny stocks and digital currencies with a Machiavellian zeal.��� Simons showed slim cut three-button suits, topcoats paired with surgical gloves and rubber boots, and turtlenecks with slits, some of which had patches with three letter acronyms like XTC and GHB. ���One was just a letter off,��� from a Bitcoin code, the FT jokes.  Simons���s clothing, in the words of the FT, could ���Fit easily on today���s youngest investors, who don���t stick to the Kiton and Zegna suits of their fathers and prefer Coinbase to TD Ameritrade.��� TD Ameritrade actually advertised Bitcoin futures during their Super Bowl ad shown last week. Next, Tom Ford showed clothes like ���Wall Street-approved pleated trousers��� paired with snakeskin printed ties. His show ended with the models displaying the company���s new launch of an underwear line of silk boxers in ���shimmering metallics and animal prints.��� FT sees a potential in the Tom Ford underwear line to become a ���new kind of uniform��� for those in Wall Street that have become interested in crypto on the side: ���Day traders flipping cryptocurrencies at home need something to wear.���	2
The first two-quarters of the year 2017 have seen the crypto industry experience a massive growth in awareness and adoption. From a perspective of economics, the high demand for Blockchain products, whether for preliminary investigations or systematic adoption has automatically generated an influx of capital which consequently reflects the value of the tokens of these Blockchains. The growing Blockchain partnerships offers an explanation for the significant increase in market capitalization of various cryptocurrencies and the consequent surge in Bitcoin price and several top altcoins. One of the major ways being observed for the enhancement and adoption of the Blockchain technology is through partnerships with existing conventional companies. Recently, Ripple experienced a significant surge in value and market capitalization. This is perceived to be as a result of the establishment of a collaborative project amongst banks in the Japanese Consortium for cross-border and domestic payments. Another example of partnerships that have significantly impacted on the market capitalization and overall value of the Blockchain technology is the implementation of a partnership-based strategy by Ethereum with the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance earlier this year. A partnership which attracts large-scale conglomerates like JPMorgan. With several more partnerships expected, PwC Greater China Chairman, Raymund Chao believes that such partnerships are essential for robust execution in the present day business environment. Chao says: ���Embracing advanced technology for growth becomes the top priority for many business sectors. Innovative applications and solutions could improve the effectiveness of supply chain, brand reputation, and even customer experience.��� Chao���s comment comes in the event of yet another partnership within the Blockchain industry. A partnership that sees business solutions company, PwC make its first Blockchain investment by adopting BitSE���s VeChain, a Blockchain-based anti-counterfeit and supply chain company out of China, with the aim of accelerating Blockchain adoption in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. The impact of Blockchain adoption through partnerships by conventional entities has become very significant. As the industry grows and tending towards reasonable global adoption, more partnerships are expected. The direct consequence of such development is increased demand for the technology, which directly implies a surge in market capitalization and subsequent rise in the value of associated cryptocurrencies.	2
A little-known altcoin known as Metacoin (MTC) surged to 486% gains in just 24 hours on Jan. 18, after Bittrex Global announced it would be listing the coin against Bitcoin (BTC). Metacoin is built on the Hyperledger network, an umbrella project of open-source technologies focused around building permissioned blockchain ecosystems for large cross-industry enterprises. Metacoin became the first cryptocurrency of Hyperledger���s to achieve mainnet status when it went live in 2018. Hyperledger was founded by the Linux Foundation, and is overseen by a host of ���premium members���, comprising leading technology and finance companies, such as IBM, J.P. Morgan, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and more.  On Jan. 15, the Bittrex Global cryptocurrency exchange announced that it had opened its Metacoin wallet for deposits of MTC, and that trading against Bitcoin would soon follow.  Little over 48 hours after the announcement was made, the value of each MTC coin had more than quintupled. From a starting price of $0.026540 on Sunday night, the dollar value of the coin increased more than fivefold, climbing to a brief peak of $0.155600 by Monday afternoon - a 486% increase. Metacoin trade volume hit an all-time high of $482,000 on the day, all emanating from a single BTC trading pair on the Liquid exchange. This just exceeds the $444,000 volume recorded in August 2020, during the coin���s first two weeks on the open market.  Notably, despite the surge following hot on the heels of the announcement by Bittrex Global, no trading data for Metacoin yet exists on the site, and the BTC/MTC pair was still signalled as being ���offline���. Taking Hyperledger���s cross-industry modular toolkit as a starting point, Metacoin acts as a multi-function blockchain platform where tokens for businesses and commerce can be issued on-chain. The platform also plays host to a number of DApps, including ColdBank, a crypto custody service which utilizes IBM���s LinuxONE technology, as well as blockchain gaming apps.	2
As Bitcoin continues to grow and grow, people try to quantify where it stands in relation to other markets, companies, people, and even countries. As it stands today, Bitcoin is worth more than the GDP of New Zealand. Of course, this makes it sound like a dangerously huge entity, and also makes it sound like it is inflating to a bubble-pop point, but with all these comparisons; from the Queen, to Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, it is more important to look at its market status. Bitcoin can buy you a lot of things, in terms of retail, but in terms of value globally, it can buy a lot more. However, despite the buying power of this digital currency, it is still that same small fish in a large market ocean. If suddenly, you found yourself in possession of every Bitcoin in existence, you first stop should be your own private Island; Richard Branson-esque. But instead of a sandbar, why not buy New Zealand whose GDP sits at economy, is valued at $185 bln, according to World Bank data. You could also instead opt for Qatar, Kuwait and Hungary. Business more of your thing? You could get into the banking market ironically and buyout Goldman Sachs and UBS. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.���s market cap is $97 bln while UBS Group AG came in at about $67 bln. Add those numbers together and it still falls short of Bitcoin. Traveling will be important with your new found fame, so why not buy Boeing? The aeronautics company has a market cap of $162 bln thanks to over a century of building the aerospace frontier. Bitcoin is worth more than that and is less than 10 years old. Perhaps you are a little paranoid about this earth and would like some military hardware, you could spring for 14 aircraft carriers. The USS Gerald R. Ford, the first of a new class of nuclear-powered supercarriers, was delivered to the US Navy in May. It cost an estimated $13 bln. There is also a chance to be the richest person in the room if that room had the mega-rich Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and even her majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Gates and Buffett come in with nearly $90 bln each while the Queen chips in with a paltry $383 mln. All these comparisons really illustrate is that there is value in Bitcoin and that it has buying power. Many can look at that as signs that this emerging currency is getting too big for its own good, but it���s not. Comparing the residential real estate market to how many aircraft carriers you can buy (1,2461 by the way) it is ridiculous and nonsensical. That is because the real estate market is just that, a mega-market that has structure in place that can collapse, and even pop. Bitcoin is too small to pop, despite what many of the major money men feel, such as Buffet. Buffett claimed that Bitcoin is a ���real bubble,��� when giving a speech in early October. "People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates. You can���t value Bitcoin because it���s not a value-producing asset." Jim Rogers, the famous investor guru and founder of the Rogers International Commodity Index (RICI) has expressed his opinion that Bitcoin ���looks and smells��� like a bubble. Via a technically sound ���smell test��� Rogers has suggested that Bitcoin is a bubble. In fact, the investment guru said: ���It looks and smells like all the bubbles I have seen throughout history.��� Secret symbol ��� 27: w What is this?	2
Donald Trump saying he is not a fan of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency is ���yuge��� for the industry, commentators were suggesting after new tweets on July 12. In the hours after the United States��� president delivered his lackluster appraisal of crypto, the Bitcoin price stayed stable, only to then begin growing to hit 1% gains Friday.  Negative or not, for proponents, the event marked a psychological milestone for Bitcoin, as Trump had previously held off from mentioning it in public.  The fact that he felt the need to bash Bitcoin publicly feeds the narrative that it is both independent of global powers and unable to be crushed by them, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated, leading the responses. ���Achievement unlocked! I dreamt about a sitting U.S. president needing to respond to growing cryptocurrency usage years ago. ���First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.��� We just made it to step 3 y'all,��� he tweeted. Armstrong exemplified the buoyant mood among Bitcoiners. Others likewise thanked Trump for the free publicity, noting a surge in interest documented by Google Trends, while the president being wrong in his opinion also became a talking point on social media.  ���Congratulations BTC community ��� the president of the United States feels we are worthy of a tweet now,��� cryptocurrency entrepreneur, Simon Dixon, added. ���Bitcoin has outperformed USD by 23,440,508% since it started being priced in USD.���  Max Keiser, the RT host and regular Bitcoin bull, considered Trump to have nullified his chances of reelection in 2020, while eToro senior analyst, Mati Greenspan, described his words as an ���early nomination for the most bullish tweet of the year.���  Despite the conversely more stable price performance since the tweets, the possibility of a ���Trump pump��� occurring for Bitcoin was also gaining traction among analysts. ���Trump is bullish for Bitcoin generally because his media tactics wobble geo-political uncertainty. Thanks for all the dollars flowing into Bitcoin,��� cryptographer and Hashcash inventor, Adam Back, added. In the meantime, another, lesser-known cryptocurrency took the opportunity to capitalize on the buzz. TrumpCoin (TRUMP), an altcoin all but unknown since it appeared in March 2016, was up 28% Friday.	2
Jamie Dimon is finding it difficult to ignore Bitcoin. A day after stating that he would not talk about Bitcoin, he breaks his silence to emphasize that stupid bitcoin investors will pay the price. The central theme of Jamie Dimon���s renewed attack on Bitcoin is that it is a bubble, where the underlying asset has no value. So although certain people will profit because they manage to sell their Bitcoin to late investors (the 'greater' fools), the end result will definitely be a crash. The oft-repeated comparison with the Tulip Mania was made to support his point. I don't personally understand the value of something which has no actual value.... A lot of the buyers out there are jazzing up everyday, so that maybe you will buy it too. And take them out. After his statements that Bitcoin is a fraud and that governments would crush it, Jamie Dimon has been repeatedly confronted with Bitcoin's zooming price. He nonetheless stuck to his stance that while the price might go up, it would eventually collapse. Jamie is very comfortable with dollars, but not with a decentralized, non-fiat currency like Bitcoin. "It could trade for $100,000 before it trades for zero. Tulip bulbs traded for $75,000 or something like that..." Jamie did not stop by just attacking Bitcoin, but went on to attack Bitcoin investors as well. He had previously stated that he would fire any JP Morgan employee who traded in Bitcoin, not just because it was against the rules of JP Morgan, but because they would be stupid to trade the digital currency. He again reiterated that those who have invested in Bitcoin would regret their decision. "If you are stupid enough to buy it, you will pay the price for it one day." He signed off by stating that this is the last time he is going to ever answer questions about Bitcoin and he really doesn't care. (Until tomorrow perhaps!)	1
After investment tycoon Tim Draper said earlier this week that Bitcoin (BTC) could hit $250,000 by 2022, CNBC Fast Money���s Brian Kelly has supported this prediction in a CNBC interview from yesterday, April 13. In response to a question about Draper���s high prediction, Kelly responded that although ���it sounds crazy,��� when one considers that BTC already had a 4,000 percent return over two years, a 3,000 percent return over four years could be a ���continuation of the trend we���ve seen.��� Kelly continues by noting that an increase of institutionalized money into the crypto sphere - Rockefeller���s VC arm, a Goldman Sachs executive, and Soros Fund Management - may dampen the volatility of cryptocurrencies, making them easier to use as actual currencies, and making it take four years (rather than two) to reach Draper���s suggested 2022 price point. Right now, the most common use case for crypto in Kelly���s opinion is citizens in countries with unreliable governments or banking systems. After being questioned by a friend as to why anyone would risk losing 20 percent or more with a crypto investment, Kelly said that he responded: ���Well, listen, it���s better than losing 100 percent if your assets are seized by a rogue government.��� When asked about how Fundstrat���s Tom Lee���s analysis of a crypto selloff before tax day being the reason for the market���s downswing since the new year can be reconciled with the fact that about two thirds of the crypto market���s volume are in Asia (and thus unaffected by US tax day), Kelly referred to tax selling as just the ���fuel on top��� of the market trend. According to Kelly, the parabolic run as well as a decrease in transactions, as well as the Mt. Gox sell off, all contributed to the market���s past downward swing. The key point for Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by 2022, or $25,000 by 2018, is for transaction volume to increase, according to Kelly: ���If the number of transactions [...] catch up a bit, then I do think we���ve bottomed here and I do think we���ve got a sustainable bull run ahead of us.��� This week, crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital predicted that BTC will reach $20,000 again by the end of this year, as the $6,500 mark was a probable bottom.	2
A new altcoin calling itself ���the new ERC20 Bitcoin,��� eBTC, has increased in value 335 percent since it launched Monday. The curious concept, which is attempting to become ���a tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum Blockchain,��� completed an airdrop to Ethereum (ETH) holders prior to its debut Oct. 1. ���There is currently no widely accepted tokenized version of Bitcoin on Ethereum, which is pretty surprising,��� developers explain on eBTC���s website. ���[...] As eBTC grows, it will display Ethereum's capabilities and strengthen it's (sic) stance among crypto-currencies.��� According to data from Coinmarketcap, eBTC launched with a value of around $0.03 per token, but as of press time had increased to $0.20 as exchange EtherDelta became involved in trading it.  The uptick is reminiscent of an increasing number of altcoin assets which have ridden a wave of speculative interest to balloon in price without direct links to an ICO event. Nonetheless, both volatility and overall reputability of such assets has been conspicuous. eBTC still lacks even a whitepaper, and its technical applications remain vague. ���I believe that eBTC, with adoption, could be a real asset for Ethereum,��� the developer description adds. ���It will not only boost Ethereum���s recognition in the cryptocurrency community but also in the eyes of the public, while also providing a way to utilize Ethereum���s vast capabilities with a token which is representative of Bitcoin.��� Investor enthusiasm for ERC20 tokens has previously resulted in even openly satirical concepts raising genuine value, the main example being July���s Useless Ethereum Token (UET).	2
Bitcoin is often compared with gold, and one of the chief factors of similarity it the way they���re both obtained. Similarly to gold, new Bitcoins are created via the process called ���mining.��� In fact, Bitcoin mining has a two-fold purpose: it allows for the creation of new coins and facilitates the processing of transactions in the network. Another parallel with the precious metal is that there���s a limited amount of Bitcoins that can ever be mined: no more than 21 mln coins. As of 2017, nearly 17 mln Bitcoins have already been mined. Mining can be quite a competitive task as new Bitcoins are created at a predictable and fixed rate. Those rates have been defined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, in the white paper published in 2008. The more miners join the network, the more difficult it becomes to make a profit for each of them. Because of that, miners have to remain highly competitive to keep receiving Bitcoins as a reward for validating the transactions. Bitcoin mining is the process of adding records of a new transaction to the Blockchain - the public ledger of all transactions that have ever taken place in the Bitcoin network. New transactions are added in batches called ���blocks��� roughly every 10 minutes, hence the name Blockchain. The ledger is needed for the nodes of the Bitcoin network to always be able to confirm valid transactions. In order to become a Bitcoin miner, a person first needs a computer and mining software - like the GUIMiner. This program uses the computer���s resources to perform complex mathematical calculations. When any one miner succeeds in solving their math problem, they get to create a new block and receive a certain number of Bitcoins as a reward, known as ���the block reward.��� Every 210,000 blocks, or, roughly, every four years, the block reward is halved. It started at 50 Bitcoin per block in 2009, and in 2014 it was halved to 25 Bitcoins per block. However, mining on personal computers has only been feasible in the early years of Bitcoin. By now, the network is so competitive, that using specialized hardware is the only way to make a profit. The first ASICs - or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits - were introduced in 2013, designed specifically for the purpose of mining from the start. Despite the existence of such specialized equipment, the situation didn���t become easier for miners, as new, more efficient ASICs are released all the time. And the problem of paying for electricity bills is only exacerbated by the new, power-hungry hardware. Nowadays there are many prominent companies which design and produce mining hardware. Among them, are Bitfury, Bitmain. You may also find used equipment on eBay or Amazon. So, to recap, miners use their hardware to verify valid transactions, pack them into blocks, solve mathematical problems during the process which is called ���hashing,��� and, after getting a correct solution, add new blocks to the Blockchain. Bitcoin uses a cryptographic hash function SHA-256 for encryption. This algorithm allows you to take data of any size and turn it into a string of a specific, predefined size. The resulting string is called a ���hash,��� and the process of applying the hash function to random inputs is called ���hashing.��� It���s impossible to predict what the hash of any one input will be until you actually calculate it. The goal of the miners is to keep feeding the hash function with different inputs until they get a specific hash value which is below a certain threshold, which is called the ���difficulty��� of network. The difficulty is automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks - or, roughly, every 14 days - in accordance with the growing or shrinking combined computational power of the network. If the network became more powerful over the last 2016 blocks, then the difficulty value is decreased to make it harder to find a valid hash and vice versa. Considering the immense computational power that the Bitcoin network currently employs, it takes trillions of computer-generated guesses from all over the world until the right hash value is found by someone. And if you are the first to do it - congrats! You have just mined a block and got a reward of 12,5 Bitcoins. As with any other activity, mining has some pitfalls to avoid. Let���s take a closer look at some mistakes usually made by newbie miners: You shouldn���t start mining without preparations. Given that it is a highly competitive sphere, profitable mining requires thorough planning and preparation. Many examples can be found of people, who had bought too much hardware equipment without calculating all the costs of running it and the likely profit rates. After finding out that they can���t maintain profitable operations with their equipment, these unfortunate miners usually have to re-sell it at a large discount. You also shouldn���t follow the hype and mine whatever coin that is the most trendy at the moment. From time to time, one coin or another will get overhyped, and a lot of new miners will start pouring in, driving the difficulty of its network up. As a result, mining becomes very hard for everyone, and almost no one manages to make a profit. This scenario has taken place recently with Ethereum, for example. What you should do, is take good care of your PC. Mining places a huge load on the computer���s processors, which have to run at full capacity all the time. If done without proper care, it might cause hardware malfunctions. All in all, mining is both a difficult and profitable business to get involved in. But if you���re going to try it - good luck to you!	1
Ethereum developer Piper Merriam opened Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) #958 on Github on March 30, presenting the idea of a possible hard fork in the Ethereum (ETH) protocol to invalidate ETH ASICs. Vlad Zamfir, another developer with the Ethereum Foundation, posed the same question on Twitter March 28. 57 percent of respondents voted yes. Both developers��� polls emerge amid rumors that the China-based ASIC manufacturer Bitmain is on the brink of shipping its first Ethash compatible ASIC miners. Ethash is the Proof-of-Work (PoW) hashing algorithm used by Ethereum and a variety of other altcoins. Buterin���s Ethereum White Paper suggests the protocol already has a twofold resistance to mining centralization. First, the algorithm requires miners to return the hash for data that has been ���randomly selected��� from transactions in the preceding block. Since ���Ethereum contracts can include any kind of computation,��� ���an Ethereum ASIC would essentially be an ASIC for general computation - ie. a better CPU.��� The second means of defence is to ���poison the well,��� which Vitalik characterises as ���ultimately an adaptive human solution rather than a technical one.��� If a certain type of computation becomes prevalent, then conventional miners can introduce ���a large number of contracts into the Blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs���. As Cointelegraph reported in February, Bitmain���s profits outstripped the US GPU giant Nvidia in 2017. Research by Bernstein analysts estimated Bitmain���s profits to be between $3-4 bln for 2017, holding 70-80 percent of the market for BTC miners and ASICs. Ethereum���s informal poll regarding a possible hard fork follows Monero���s rejection of centralized hashpower last month. Monero devlead Riccardo Spagni warned that the coin���s protocol would be changed every six months to stymie ASIC monopolies. Rumors regarding possible deployment of Ethash compatible ASIC miners impacted Ethereum markets, according to some commentators.	1
This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Looking at the Bitcoin graph, and that of the stock market, including the Dow Jones and the S&P 500, you may have noted an interesting similarity. The stock market was growing to new heights rapidly, with even Donald Trump tweeting how it had risen 20 percent since his election. A little before these heights, Bitcoin had also surged up to its all-time high of $20,000 on Dec. 17. Both markets then started to plunge, first, it was Bitcoin, whose price steadily dropped towards $6,000 before hitting a floor. The stock market fell a lot quicker, but the pattern looked remarkably similar, with them both finding a floor last Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its biggest one-day point drop in history on Monday, and the S&P 500 had its worst day since 2011. Questions then started to spring up whether or not there was a correlation between the vastly different assets. And can we predict the future moves? To determine if there is a correlation, one needs to address the reasons why the stock market is down and investors are seemingly selling off. John F. Wasik, behavioral finance Forbes columnist lists a couple of reasons why the Stocks have crashed. He believes that the general stock market was overpriced, and uses a gauge by Robert Shiller, a Yale economics professor, to assess that. He adds that volatility has returned, looking to the VIX index, and this is important in looking for the Bitcoin correlation. Furthermore, interest rates are rising and there is a belief that inflation may be on its way back. What happens next? According to Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the computers (which make 90 percent of deals on the stock market) make their turn, calculating that even higher inflation is inevitable. These explanations as to why the stock market crashed are vastly different to the reasons why it was assumed that Bitcoin fell by almost 70 percent. The problem for Bitcoin, following an expected correction once it hit $20,000, was that there was a stream of damaging media reports, some of them unfounded and simply incorrect. The confusion firstly in South Korea about a potential ban did its damage before it was eventually cleared up by the South Korean Government. Then, China announced it would be putting one more nail into Bitcoin���s coffin within the country by placing a firewall up to restrict foreign access to exchanges. There was even news out of India that was flagrantly misinterpreted, also regarding a potential ban, that saw Bitcoin plummet. From these external events, there is no discernible relationship as to why the Bitcoin market and the Stock market fell at the same time. But looking deeper in terms of correlation graphs, you can see some sort of link. One area of data which seems to show a sort of correlation is in a matrix of z-scores and p-scores. These correlation graphs are quite confusing, but the just of it is that if two assets share a z-score that is negative or positive, there is evidence of either a direct or inverse relationship. In the graph below, the numbers are called z-scores. They represent the direction and strength of the relationship between the two sets of data. A higher absolute z-score means greater correlation, while a lower absolute z-score means less of a correlation.    Image source: Sifr Data A simple glance at this correlation graph can show that the relationship between Bitcoin and S&P 500 is at a weak positive relationship. But, the correlation between VIX and Bitcoin  -0.31 making it a moderate negative relationship. The VIX is a so-called ���fear gauge��� and indicates the level of risk that is currently present in the markets at any time. According to this graph, there should be an inverse correlation between VIX and Bitcoin, and this was demonstrated in an article on CBOE���s website that overlayed the VIX and Bitcoin price. So it is between the VIX and Bitcoin, not the Stock Market itself, where the correlation seems to exist. But then again, for the last three years, VIX Index outperformed Bitcoin in terms of volatility and in 2015-2016 the correlation was almost non-existing, it���s 2017 that matches the pattern. Fundstrat Tom Lee shared his agreement with this sentiment on CNBC stating that the initial relationship between the Stock Graphs and the Bitcoin price had only limited correlation. "[Bitcoin���s] could easily look like a chart that looks like the S&P, because both had a parabolic move and then subsequently gave back some of these gains," Lee told CNBC���s "Trading Nation." But that's where the relationship may stagnate. Lee added that "the connection between the two is really, really limited." He went on to discuss that the correlation, if any, may have been down to a more cavalier approach by investors who were also then buying cryptocurrency. "In the past 12 months, not only did we have a strong rally in equities, we had a strong rally in cryptocurrencies. I wouldn't be surprised if those investors who saw risk-on assets everywhere outperforming globally were also buying cryptocurrencies." Analysts at Datatrek added to Lee���s sentiment about this ���crossover��� of investors. They stated: ���Since investors have only one brain to process risk, they will make similar decisions about cryptocurrencies and stocks when they see price volatility in the latter.��� Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo, believes that perhaps there is a stronger correlation than has been stated previously, but he, like Lee and Datatrek analysts, is linking these relationships more to sentiment that empirical evidence. "On Monday [February 5] what we saw is all risk products sell off," Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC's "Fast Money." A hit on the market, in his opinion, can cause investors to panic and begin selling Bitcoin as well: "It sometimes adds fuel to the fire.��� Again, it is this idea that Bitcoin has crossed a threshold into the mainstream market too that could perhaps be causing this assumed correlation. Harvey, and others, talk of similar sentiment meaning a similar sell off across the two markets. Morgan Stanley analysts have also stated that perhaps traditional investors were transferring risk from the relatively stable equities markets into Bitcoin, and vice versa, showing again this crossover that could be amalgamating the markets slightly. Marcus Poh, Trading Trainee at Octagon Strategy, also believes that the two markets are starting to intermingle somewhat as he states: ���As for it being indirectly related, I would say that BTC is considered to many as a hedge against currencies, similar to that of gold. Therefore, if the demand, recognition and acceptance of BTC becomes much larger, there is a chance it would be in a similar position to that of gold and the stock market.��� Perhaps for now the idea of correlation between the Bitcoin market and that of traditional stocks is limited to the ���fear index��� because of cryptocurrency buzz in 2017 and the bull rally of investors. They cannot truly be plotted on a graph against one another, and have often deviated at key moments. For example, In August last year, the global economy took a major hit in the face of rising tensions between the US and North Korea, but the Bitcoin market remained unfazed. But what could be concluded from this recent pattern across the markets is that investor sentiment can carry over from the stock market to the Bitcoin market. Because of a mainstream adoption wave that has seen Bitcoin accepted as an investable asset, there is the beginnings of a crossover. Thus, when fear and risk enters the stock market for reasons outlines by John Wasik then the VIX also starts to rise. It has been shown that there is an inverse correlation between this and the price of Bitcoin which can be seen on an overlapping graph. None of these relationships or correlations, tenuous as they are, can really aid in predicting the markets, they can only prove that investment fear is not just isolated to the stocks. But as for now, Tom Lee sums it up in a bold, no nonsense manner: "Cryptocurrencies have their own economy based on activity on that Blockchain. Equities have their own economy based on earnings per share multiples. The institutional overlap is essentially zero."	0
An unknown Bitcoin Cash (BCH) miner was apparently in control of more than 50% of the token���s hash rate for 24 hours. The miner seemed to mine 73 blocks from 10 am Oct. 24 to 10 am Oct. 25, to which Twitter user Notgrubles responded that this is the reason why ���BCH is a security risk and a liability,��� while asking to de-list the coin. By controlling 50% of BCH hash rate, the unknown miner, or potentially miners, are not far off from controlling the entire network and the ability to do ���nefarious things��� as one Redditor eloquently said.  Redditor Bitmeister had perhaps the most interesting view on this recent event, by saying that it is likely that Bitcoin (BTC) miners are experimenting with their otherwise useless BTC hashpower by pointing it at BCH. At the end of September Bitcoin���s network hash rate dipped a record 40%. The flash drop remained unexplained and was all the more striking given the Bitcoin network���s record-breaking string of new all-time high hash rates throughout the summer. Just days before, Cointelegraph had reported that Bitcoin���s hash rate had passed a record 102 quintillion hashes in a historic milestone. A higher hash rate means greater competition among miners to validate new blocks. It also increases the number of resources needed for performing a 51% attack, making the network more secure. In sync with Bitcoin���s sudden price boost yesterday, altcoin markets also entered the green zone, with BCH recording a massive gain of more than 15% on the day as of press time.	1
Blockchain technology has huge potential to transform business models, but a large part of this potential is still untapped. While Ethereum is leading the smart contract platforms, other platforms such as Qtum and NEO are also contributing to the growth of Blockchain integration into the business world, by offering their unique and innovative solutions. Cointelegraph spoke to Jordan Earls, co-founder of Qtum Foundation, about Blockchain technology in Asia, and the company���s role in the Blockchain ecosystem. Often referred to as an ���Ethereum killer���, Qtum Blockchain is a hybrid platform that combines Bitcoin Core and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. As a smart contract solution, Qtum utilizes Proof-of-Stake validation for transactions, which is said to be less computationally expensive than the Proof-of-Work validation system employed by Ethereum. Qtum aims to be a platform where decentralized applications for the business world such as supply chain management, telecommunications, social networking and Internet of Things can be built upon. Earls explains to Cointelegraph: ���I wouldn���t call Qtum an Ethereum killer, in fact we hope Ethereum continues to grow, because the Blockchain industry is still small. If a platform like Ethereum were to die, then a number of great people would probably leave the industry. That being said, ���Ethereum Killers��� have the benefit of seeing where the shortcomings of the platform are, and then trying to correct them. The crazy thing about the Blockchain space is that nothing is foreseeable beyond a year���s time. I think Ethereum will hold its own in that time, but other platforms will definitely cut their lead.��� Ethereum as the leader of the smart contract platforms is not without its own technical shortcomings. Two major problems that Ethereum is struggling with is scalability, as it requires every single node to process every transaction in the entire network, and the computationally expensive Proof-of-Work validation. Newer smart contract platforms are designed to overcome the shortcomings of Ethereum. According to Earls, most projects in the ecosystem have matured beyond that and now see the greater picture. ���Part of my mission as Co-Chair of the Smart Contracts Alliance is to push industry standards and help bring this ecosystem into a better light with governments and businesses���, he says. Compared to the rest of the world, China has been a leader for Blockchain application. The recent temporary ban on ICOs may have dampened the speed of Blockchain development in the region. Nevertheless, it can be foreseen that Chinese space will continue to grow after the temporary ban is lifted. Jordan Earls offers insight to the current Blockchain ecosystem in China: ���The Chinese Blockchain ecosystem is growing relatively fast compared to the rest of the world. It���s growing so fast that people are having to take a step back and take a breather. We���ve established ourselves as a leader in China and Asia, which is why over ten dapps have chosen to build on our platform before we have formally launched. Our role in China illustrates that we can collaborate globally - start strong in China and become a global technology leader.��� Earls believes that the current state of decentralized applications in China is astonishing. Over the past few months alone, the industry has attracted top talent from large technology companies to build applications that utilize Blockchain technology. He says to Cointelegraph: ���Some of these projects are disrupting industries that haven���t seen any innovation in decades, like how Energo is building an autonomous energy network, and Inkchain is changing the content industry. Projects are coming to us almost everyday telling us they want to build on Qtum.��� Recently, the company launched a platform that allows utilization of smart contracts on mobile phones through a secure network. The system is known as Qtum Ignition has a self-regulating, self-modifying, and self-aware component called the decentralized governance protocol (DGP). This makes Qtum's blockchain the first self-governing in the industry. The features integrated into Ignition that Earls finds the most interesting are the successful integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine into UTXO Blockchain, and the Decentralized Governance Protocol. ���Many projects are already utilizing Qtum to tackle various business use cases. There is one project named Vevue which is helping content creators monetize their work with Blockchain. And then Aberide is building an Uber-like ride sharing platform on the Qtum Blockchain. Qtum���s mobile focus, and conservative but stable Blockchain, makes an ideal platform for businesses to build practical applications on; finally, I think the entire Blockchain ecosystem is still finding new use cases for Blockchain technology; so, we still have a long way to go.���	1
After the February���s crypto market slump that brought Bitcoin (BTC) below $7000, the number of Google searches for ���Bitcoin��� has dropped to the lowest levels since October of last year.  Google Trends shows that searches for ���Bitcoin��� were the most popular between December 17-23, coinciding with Bitcoin���s price rising to above $20,000 for the first time on December 17, 2017. However, since mid-February, searches for ���Bitcoin��� have gone downhill, leaving the search term with a score of 19 for the first half of March -- meaning that the search is only a 19th as popular as it was in December at its peak. According to Google Trends, ���Bitcoin��� had a score of 19 in the first week of October 2017, when its price was around $4300 according to data from CoinMarketCap. Reports that a former Mt. Gox trustee had sold $400 mln worth of BTC over a period from December through February suggest that BTC���s continuing slump and this large sell off are connected.	0
While the crypto space has seen tremendous growth over the past decade, the asset class still holds a tiny amount of value compared to mainstream markets, especially when pitted against giants such as Apple.  Apple stock (AAPL) holds a staggering $2 trillion market cap, dwarfing all the speculative capital held within the entire crypto space, which, at press time, totals a mere $342.8 billion according to CoinMarketCap.  The crypto industry has grown from simply a concept in 2008, with the inception of Bitcoin's white paper, to hosting billions of invested dollars. Bitcoin itself went from less than $1 per coin, all the way to $20,000 at its all-time high, carrying a press time market cap of roughly $194 billion.   The entire industry, however, still sits at a fraction of the size of Apple's total combined stock shares; the market cap of the Blockchain industry as a whole could triple and still not reach Apple's market valuation.  The tech company, known for pushing the smart phone revolution, currently holds the biggest market cap on the U.S. stock market, based on data from TradingView. "It���s the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $2 trillion market cap," CNBC said of Apple in an Aug. 19 brief.  As of press time, Bitcoin itself has reached parity with the net worth of Jeff Bezos. The two stores of wealth have duked it out in recent months in terms of overall U.S. dollar value.	1
March 18 update: In a confusing decision, Bitmain has updated their sales page again for the batches 3 and 4 of the Antminer X3 to read ���No shipping to Hong Kong,��� while only yesterday the description for these batches denoted that they would ���only��� be shipped to Hong Kong. Bitmain���s just-released ASIC-powered Antminer X3, designed to mine the CryptoNight hashing algorithm used by Monero (XMR), may not be effective by its first release in May 2018, according to an article by The Next Web published yesterday, March 16. The new Antminer, announced on Bitmain���s Twitter on March 15, comes at two price points: $11,999 for the first round in delivered May, and $7,599 for the second batch, delivered in June. However, the project lead at Monero, Riccardo Spagni, linked to Bitmain���s Twitter announcement in his own tweet, stating that their new miner will ���NOT WORK [sic]��� for mining Monero: Just a reminder that this WILL NOT work on Monero https://t.co/rhy6k2I4Yh Bitmain is also offering two additional batches that ship after the first two batches, but only to addresses in Hong Kong. The two new batches are priced at  $3,000 for shipping after batch 1 and $1,900 for shipping after batch 2. Apparently following Spagni���s response, the sales pages for the two Hong-Kong bound Antminer X3 batches were updated to contain the following notice in the product description: ���One major cryptocurrency which is using CryptoNight hash function is about to change their PoW algothrim, and according to their public statement, it is purposely to brick ASIC mining rigs including X3. When you buying it, you are betting that they are wrong.��� The notice adds that there will be no refunds accepted. In February of this year, in response to potential threats of new types of ASIC mining that would be able to mine Monero, the privacy-centered cryptocurrency wrote on their blog about their ���intention to maintain ASIC resistance by swiftly reacting to any potential threat from ASICs and considering slightly modifying the PoW at every hardfork���: ���We strongly believe that it's beneficial to preserve our ASIC resistance. Therefore, we will perform an emergency hard fork to curb any potential threat from ASICs if needed. Furthermore, in order to maintain its goal of decentralization and to provide a deterrent for ASIC development and to protect against unknown or undetectable ASIC development, the Monero team proposes modifying the Cryptonight PoW hash every scheduled fork, twice a year.��� The Next Web does note that the Antminer X3 is marketed for mining more than Monero, as it is also compatible with Bytecoin, Aeon, Dash, and several others, although the site adds the caveat that there is ���no guarantee this will still be the case��� by May and June. Users on Reddit have quickly taken offense to Bitmain���s new Antminer. Reddit user KnifeofPi2 posted yesterday, March 16, an excerpt from a satirical press release alleging that Bitmain was entering the ���doorstopper��� business: ���When asked why a doorstopper had the word "miner" in its name, Jihan Wu, the CEO of Bitmain, stated that "The Antminer X3 looks, works and sounds like a cryptocurrency miner. It even has a built-in 550 watt heater that hashes an obsolete algorithm." Another Reddit user, hodlingvtv, took a more serious approach, writing that ���Bitmain is currently performing a large scam���: ���tl,dr: Don't buy bitmain's x3. They asic mined monero and now that this will not be possible anymore they want to dump their machines on you.��� The normally secretive Bitmain made the news in late February, when a report showed that the four-year-old company had made profits between $3 and $4 bln in 2017, while American graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer Nvidia, founded 24 years ago, made $3 bln during the same time period.	1
Just when Bitcoin miners thought mining on the phone and hydro mining were revolutionary, an owner of a Tesla S electric car model is using the free power from the supercharger of his vehicle to mine the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin. To do this, the owner installed a Bitcoin mining computer in the trunk of the car. The mining rig is then charged by the car���s supercharger while it mines Bitcoin. This is an interesting way to mine cryptocurrencies, but it could be very lucrative for the owner as his operating cost while mining the digital currencies is virtually zero. His only major investment is the cost of the mining rig itself, as well as the associated equipment and accessories. The exploration of innovative and creative methods of mining Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is always a very interesting endeavor because of the continuous increase in the price of the digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin. The use of the superchargers of electric vehicles like the Tesla model could be a good idea, but some issues may arise. Among these concerns is the possibility that the mining rig could produce lots of heat that could damage the car���s internal parts over time. The car���s battery pack could also be easily damaged when used continuously for Bitcoin mining. Despite its great potential and possibly good profits, Tesla or other electric car owners should decide carefully if they want to use this approach to mine cryptocurrencies due to its potential adverse effects on the performance of their cars. Those who want to mine digital currencies may also want to explore other approaches in mining like the use of renewable energies like solar panels. However, because they are still in the early phase of developments, these new technologies require a hefty upfront investment. Miners should be prepared to spend a large amount of money if they decide to mine Bitcoin using these methods.	1
Binance had a hiccup with its withdrawals for Ether (ETH) and all ERC-20 assets on Friday, with users being unable to access any of their Ethereum-based assets for about one hour. The pause came abruptly, as the exchange's Twitter account notified users that Binance had ���temporarily suspended withdrawals of ETH and Ethereum-based tokens in order to address a congestion issue.��� Binance reassured that ���funds are SAFU,��� but did not provide any further details. About one hour later, withdrawals were apparently restored but the exchange did not attempt to explain what prompted them to pause such a critical piece of its infrastructure. The somewhat vague motivation of ���congestion issues��� seems to have indicated that Ethereum���s high gas fees had something to do with the pause. The community showed skepticism at such an explanation, with Red, a moderator in the Harvest Finance community, drawing a connection to the rise of Binance Smart Chain: Indeed, data shows that Friday was not in any way exceptional in terms of blockchain congestion. A DuneAnalytics dashboard by Alex Kroeger shows that prices were in line with the previous two days.  According to Etherscan data, average gas prices are now lower than at the beginning of February, which makes Binance���s current statements all the more confusing. Either way, congestion by itself should not be a major issue for an exchange. These circumstances attracted suspicion toward Binance���s true motives, with popular pseudonymous analyst Hasu suggesting that it was a ���declaration of war on Ethereum.��� While the comment was posted before withdrawals resumed, the community at large remains confused as to what exactly happened. A technical malfunction could be an adequate explanation. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried noted that the Amazon Web Services cluster hosting both Binance and FTX was down, which created issues for the platforms. Bankman-Fried was replying to reports of denial-of-service attacks, however. A Binance spokesperson contacted by Cointelegraph did not wish to provide any further details, though they said it was a ���mundane issue.��� Curiously, Binance Coin (BNB) price spiked from $260 to a brief peak of $350 immediately after the pause was announced. Ether had a mild fall from $1,930 to $1,916 during that time frame, which could have been a normal market fluctuation. Many are ascribing the BNB rally to growing usage of Binance Smart Chain, which now has double the daily transactions of Ethereum. It would appear that the exchange would have no reason to actively undermine the Ethereum blockchain, but the lack of clear communication is letting speculation run wild. Patrick Maguire, operations lead at node infrastructure provider Pocket Network, commented on the overall significance of the event:	1
Germany-headquartered car manufacturing giant Daimler AG, famous for its Mercedes-Benz and Smart brands, presented its own Blockchain-based digital currency MobiCoin at the Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reported on March 5.   The project, which started in February 2018, was created to reward drivers for environmentally-friendly driving habits, i.e. smooth and safe driving at low speeds. The project will be in its testing phase for the next three months, during which 500 drivers who follow eco-friendly driving practices will be rewarded with MobiCoins. According to Cointelegraph auf Deutsch, data from the vehicles will be transmitted to Daimler and converted into MobiCoins, which will be stored in a mobile app. Participants with the most MobiCoins will reportedly receive VIP tickets for events such as the DTM Races, the MercedesCup Final, or Fashion Week in Berlin. However, it is not known whether drivers will be able to convert the MobiCoins to fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. Recent months have seen multiple German auto giants embrace Blockchain tech. In February 2018, German car manufacturing giant BMW announced its partnership with VeChain, the blockchain-based supply chain enhancement platform. The same month, Stuttgart-based Porsche announced it has teamed up with Berlin-based startup XAIN to use Blockchain technology in improving locking systems and the capabilities of autonomous cars. Earlier, in January 2018, Volkswagen���s Chief Digital Officer Johann Jungwirth joined the supervisory board of the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit Blockchain foundation for the Internet of Things (IoT).	2
In glad tidings for an orange Christmas, Bitcoin (BTC) supply is drying up to lows not seen for years. In a recent tweet by CryptoRank, just 6.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, or 1.3 million BTC, is held on cryptocurrency exchanges.  The decreasing supply is nothing new, trending down since the Bitcoin halving in 2020 when the BTC block reward was cut in two. BTC availability on exchanges followed suit, slowly trending down over the past year. Exchange wallets accounted for 9.5% of the BTC supply in October 2020, just before the 2020 Christmas all-time highs, and 7.3% in July this year. The 6.3% December figure is the lowest recorded in 2021. Interestingly, Coinbase���s BTC wallet dominance is also slipping. The American exchange used to custody more BTC than all other exchanges combined. Its dominance has slipped from 50.52% to 40.65% over the past year.  The news follows a swathe of positive price metrics that dovetail the upward price action of Bitcoin. Firstly, the illiquid BTC supply has iced over for the winter as the BTC supply going from a "liquid" to an "illiquid" state is now 100,000 BTC per month. In essence, more BTC is locked away into cold storage than the amount being mined.  Glassnode, the on-chain analytics company, shared further bullish news regarding exchange behavior. The seven-day moving average for BTC���s exchange inflow volume just reached a five-month low of 978.452 BTC and has been trending down week on week. The exchange supply shortage may continue with less and less BTC sent to exchanges.  Furthermore, it���s important to note that many retail investors and some companies store their BTC on exchanges, indicating that the "illiquid" BTC may be even lower. Some BTC hodlers would leave the custody of their keys to exchanges instead of taking their BTC offline into cold storage. Unsurprisingly, Binance CEO and co-founder Changpeng Zhao has encouraged the hot wallet practice, despite the best efforts of Bitcoiners like Andreas Antonopolous ensuring "not your keys, not your Bitcoin" is part of everyday BTC mantra.  As a result, while 1.3 million BTC rests on exchanges, they may not be "circulating," and may, in fact, contribute to the illiquid supply.  Nonetheless, despite calls for a ���Santa Rally��� off the back of bullish analytics, the bears are not yet out of the woods. A tweet by BullRun Invest using Glassnode data shows that 24.6% of all BTC supply is sitting above the price of $47,000.  It suggests that roughly a quarter of the BTC bought at those price levels are currently underwater. If BTC fails to make progress into the 50s, there may be fewer presents under the tree tomorrow.	1
American television host Ellen Degeneres took a jab explaining what Bitcoin (BTC) was to her live audience yesterday, Feb. 15, by comparing the digital currency to a goat that ���doesn���t exist except for on that Internet.��� If you want to know what bitcoin is, I learned about it. A bit. pic.twitter.com/txICiTXYgi After asking the audience who has heard of Bitcoin to applause, and then asking who can explain what Bitcoin is, Degeneres answered her own question: ���Nobody knows how it works. Nobody. Everybody���s talking about Bitcoin and nobody understands it. It���s like a plot twist in a confusing movie.��� While her comparison of Bitcoin���s digital nature as similar to that of a picture of a cute goat that only exists online doesn���t fully transmit a solid understanding of cryptocurrency, Degeneres does correctly explain that BTC works ���sort of like the stock market��� and that one can store their Bitcoin in a digital wallet that can either be off or online. Due to the recent market volatility that brought Bitcoin���s price up to $20,000 in December and below $7000 in February -- not quite the ���$20,000 or nothing��� that Degeneres says -- she sees Bitcoin as a ���digital Antiques Roadshow��� that can make you either ���a millionaire or totally broke.��� A lack of consumer understanding of cryptocurrencies is often cited as the reason more government regulation is needed. EU regulators have again cautioned potential crypto investors against investing in something whose risks they don���t understand, and the IMF chief recently cited a ���herd mentality��� as a cause for needing crypto regulation. Commentators on Reddit overall liked the non-technical nature of Degeneres���s Bitcoin explanation, user FalcoLamborghini writing that ���considering the audience, this was actually good for BTC.��� Even after her research into what Bitcoin is, Degeneres still tells her audience, ���Personally, I���d rather own a baby goat���	1
Daniel Marburger, Director of Europe-based online gold dealer CoinInvest, claimed the company sold about 30 kilograms of gold, worth over $1 mln, in just one day, Jan. 16, in an interview with Bloomberg Wednesday, Jan. 17. This week has been very volatile for Bitcoin and several industry insiders cited by Bloomberg believe that investors are looking for more stable assets in the meantime. Bitcoin, along with most other cryptocurrencies, experienced a crash of over 40% this Tuesday, Jan. 16 that lasted until Jan. 18, potentially causing a spike in gold investment. Marburger told Bloomberg that gold coin sales increased fivefold on Jan. 16, the same time cryptocurrencies were crashing. ���[Tuesday] was a hell of a crazy day,��� Marburger said, adding that ���emails and phones did not stand still with customers asking how they could turn their crypto into gold.��� A similar situation was described by the Ireland-based GoldCore LTD, where customers have been cashing out from cryptocurrencies and buying physical gold for the past three months. GoldCore���s director Mark O���Byrne informed Bloomberg via email about the worried clients: ���They told us they were concerned that the massive price appreciation was unsustainable and they got nervous about it. We think increasingly people are realizing that these digital assets have much higher risk levels than the traditional safe haven asset [that is gold].��� Earlier in Dec. 2017 when cryptocurrency prices were achieving record highs, Larry McDonald, the head of US macro strategy at ACG Analytics, claimed in an interview with CNBC that investors were dumping gold to buy Bitcoin during November and December 2017. ���Cryptocurrencies are definitely eating into the gold play,��� stated McDonald back then. This inverse dynamic serves as another proof of a potential negative correlation between investors��� interest towards gold and cryptocurrencies.	0
The Canadian government has released an official draft of new regulations on crypto exchanges and payment processors, Canada Gazette reports June 9. According to the draft, the new regulations seek to address a ���number of deficiencies��� that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) outlined after their evaluation in 2015-16, namely in strengthening Canada���s Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Regime (AML/ATF). The new regulations will treat crypto exchanges and payment processors as money service businesses (MSB), which requires them to report large transactions ��� those over $10,000 Canadian dollars ($7700 USD) ��� and a new Know Your Customer (KYC) threshold set at transactions of $1000 CAD ($770 USD). The draft also contains a cost-benefit analysis, which reveals the regulations would cost about $61 CAD mln ($47 mln USD) over the next 10 years. Francis Pouliot, co-founder of Montreal-based blockchain consulting firm Catallaxy, tweeted his response to the draft: ���New requirement: "Large Virtual Currency Transaction Record" means businesses required to ask for and keep details of every transaction over $10,000, like large-cash transaction reports. That's going to be extremely difficult and invasive to implement. I will object to this.��� The FATF is an intergovernmental organization that develops policies to combat money laundering. These policies are not legally binding, but according to the draft, Canada believes that implementing these regulations will have a positive impact on the country���s international reputation.	0
New legislation may make it possible for Binance US, the American branch of crypto exchange Binance, to open its doors to all traders in every state by next year. According to a Sept. 15 tweet from Binance U.S. CEO Catherine Coley, the digital asset marketplace has just launched in Georgia, allowing users to buy, trade, and earn digital assets.  Thrilled @BinanceUS launches in Georgia today - our 40th state! Atlanta means so much to me, a 1996 @kerristrug96 fangirl obsessed with the Olympics. What can I say, we���ve come a long way! pic.twitter.com/F54GibkiKT ���We added our 40th state today just a week shy of our one-year anniversary,��� stated the official Binance USaccount. ���100% coverage is our goal.��� The addition of Georgia coupled with yesterday���s announcement that Binance U.S. would be operating in Alabama means the exchange can currently be used in every U.S. state with the exception of Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, roughly 61 million people over the age of 18 reside in those states as of 2019. However, a recent announcement from an organization of state regulators may make it easier for firms like Binance US to bypass licensing in these individual states, and instead apply for the remainder with a single exam. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors has set out guidelines for payments firms already doing business in 40 or more states to enable them to get a single license to operate throughout the country. It���s unclear how long the firm would take to gain 100% coverage if it needs to take the traditional route for licensing. Binance US opened registration to U.S. users one year ago excluding 13 states, and has since added only three states, suggesting it may be slow going. But the addition of the 40th state today means that if the new guidelines are adopted in 2021, then Binance US may be allowed to legally operate as a crypto exchange nationwide.	1
Bitcoin (BTC) inflows to centralized exchanges have surged, prompting bearish speculation that the crypto markets could be building up to a violent wash-out. Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovoski Capital, shared data showing that 22,917 BTC was transferred onto centralized exchanges in a single hour on Tuesday. Moskovski noted the hourly inflow was the largest since the March 2020 ���Black Thursday��� crash. 22,917 #Bitcoin in a single hour were deposited to exchanges yesterday.This hourly inflow is rivaled only by the March, 2020 crash.People are scared. pic.twitter.com/uH4lBL6Onk With outflows from exchanges typically being inferred as indicating crypto assets are being moved into cold storage for security or DeFi protocols for yield generation, inflows are interpreted as assets being moved onto centralized platforms to be sold. Data compiled by on-chain crypto analytics firm Glassnode shows the past two days have seen consecutive all-time highs produced for net transfer volume of Bitcoin onto leading centralized exchange Binance. The data was shared by Twitter analyst William Clemente III to his 70,400 followers, triggering bearish price predictions on social media. Largest day of BTC inflows to Binance ever. pic.twitter.com/HG56s37mtv The chart indicates roughly 35,000 Bitcoin worth more than $1.4 billion has been deposited on Binance in the past 48 hours. ���Feels like capitulation,��� said Kraken growth lead Dan Held. Clemente replied: ���Let���s see one final nasty liquidation wick.���  Despite Bitcoin���s price grinding down to post local lows below $40,000, some analysts are finding reasons to be bullish. Popular analyst Lark Davis noted the recent downturn has pushed Bitcoin���s 14-day relative-strength indicator into oversold territory for the first time since March 2020, suggesting the crash may be nearing its plateau. Others are welcoming capitulation as a likely catalyst for a bullish recovery, predicting a swift return to upward momentum once selling has become exhausted. Twitter user YHRW80 noted surging flows into Bitcoin���s spot and derivatives markets during 2021, concluding that the dominant emotion gripping the markets is ���greed��� rather than fear.  However, Bitcoin���s Fear and Greed Index disagrees with YHRW80���s analysis, describing current Bitcoin market sentiment as ���extreme fear.��� There was some welcome news today, with Indian media reporting the country���s government is set to rethink its planned crypto ban and form a new panel of experts to explore regulating crypto assets in India.  Some analysts suggest the catalyst for the surging inflows is tomorrow���s looming deadline for controversial stablecoin issuer Tether to disclose its quarterly financial records as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General���s office. Last week, Tether posted a breakdown of its reserves for the first time, asserting three-quarters of the assets backing its stablecoin are cash, cash equivalents, other short-term deposits and commercial paper.	0
The price of the virtual currency Litecoin reaches an all-time high of $87 per token on as of press time, amidst the sustained solid performance of the cryptocurrency market. It is projected that the price of the digital currency could even surpass the $100 level before the year ends. The trading of Litecoin has reached almost $381 mln in a 24-hour period across all trading exchanges. This shows that the digital currency is moving towards it all-time high as Bitcoin surged past $9,000. The majority of the Litecoin trading volume was dominated by the exchanges GDAX and Bitfinex, outperforming cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb. The trading data also showed that there are three fiat currency trading pairs among the top three, signifying that there is new capital entering the digital currency market. Litecoin���s sustained upward trajectory is just one of the positive developments in the digital currency market. Earlier, the altcoins Bitcoin and Ethereum have posted record increase in prices. These were followed by Monero and Dash, which also set all-time highs in their prices during trading. The sustained strong performance of the other digital currencies amidst Bitcoin���s phenomenal rise is seen as a sign that the cryptocurrency market will experience phenomenal growth in the near future. In the past, when Bitcoin performed well, the other altcoins like Litecoin were usually adversely affected and posted sharp declines. This new trend shows that the altcoins are increasingly being accepted in the market. Litecoin���s surge is a sign that the industry players already see the potential of the cryptocurrency. This has also helped pushed the digital currency���s market capitalization to more than $4.5 bln and strengthened the altcoin���s solid growth in the market. It remains to be seen, however, if this bullish performance will be sustained in the days to come.	2
Bitcoin (BTC) continued defying expectations to retake $12,000 on July 4 as analysts increasingly compare its performance to 2017���s parabolic rise.   Market visualization courtesy of Coin360 Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD retracing slightly to $11,680 after hitting $12,025, continuing a rebound which began on Tuesday.  Bitcoin���s behavior had surprised most earlier in the week, after a bearish move downwards to just $9,700 suddenly U-turned, mushrooming into fresh growth.  Now, charts are looking increasingly like a repeat of bitcoin���s progress in the second half of 2017, regular trader Filb Filb says.  Despite uploading what he described as a tongue-in-cheek chart, its prophecy ��� $14,000 ��� would nonetheless likely come true, he explained, noting bitcoin must first clear resistance around $12,100.   Bitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Coin360 ���Last couple days were a bear trap (in my opinion) and Bitcoin continues to look strong,��� fellow trader and investor, Josh Rager, continued.  ���Lots of buyer interest at $10k and see a move up over $12ks this coming week[.] One step at a time, will look to new yearly highs after $12k/$13k reclaimed.��� Bitcoin���s 2019 high so far resides at just over $13,800. In future, prediction models suggest, a year-end price of $21,000 would be appropriate, eclipsing the 2017 all-time high of $20,000. Bitcoin meanwhile also continues to climb in overall market dominance, currently accounting for just under 63% of the total cryptocurrency market cap ��� the highest since the 2017 price peak.  The figure spells out ongoing pain for altcoin investors, with major tokens failing once again to match bitcoin���s growth performance.  Against 6% gains for BTC/USD, ethereum (ETH) remained stagnant, so far only briefly reclaiming the $300 mark.   Ether 7-day price chart.
